# Appendix L: The Thologram and <u>Religion</u>

###### <u>Awareness</u> and <u>Intention</u>, or God

## <u>Tholonic</u> Divinity

The <u>tholonic</u> claim is that our <u>understanding</u> of <u>reality</u> is determined by the context of our <u>understanding</u> the universally consistent <u>laws</u>, and because of this, we will see the same <u>patterns</u> through these different <u>cultural</u> lenses.  

Prior to modern <u>science</u>, it was <u>religion</u> that provided that lens, and over thousands of years inspired and brilliant minds studied and philosophized on the <u>nature</u> of these god-given tenants in an attempt to unveil the mysteries of the God, the <u>Universe</u>, and Life.  

Not surprisingly then, we can see a <u>number</u> of parallels between the ancient <u>understanding</u> of God, the creations of God, and the thologram.

In the traditional and current <u>Christian</u> view of the Judaeo-Christian model (The Jewish model is similar, but not exactly the same) there exists 9 angelic choirs made up of 3 spheres of responsibility with each sphere having 3 classes of angels.

This is remarkably similar to the <u>tholonic</u> model, but limited to a single tholon.

We can even see how the class of angles fits neatly into the <u>tholonic</u> trinity of *Negotiation/Definition/Contribution* (or *Balance/Limitation/Form*):

- *Negotiation/balance* angels are tasked with care-taking, delivering, and manifesting the will of God.
- *Defining/limiting* angels are tasked with guarding, operating, and watching God’s creations.
- *Contributing/form* angels are the wheels, the warriors, and man’s personal guiding angels.

Even more astonishing is that some of the greatest <u>religious</u> philosophers have described this angelic <u>hierarchy</u> in ways that sound perfectly tholonic.  For example, the most respected and influential philosopher and Torah scholar of the Middle Ages, Maimonides (Moses ben Maimon, 1138–1204 CE. Spain), in his book “Guide of the Perplexed”, explains at length how angels are forms of <u>intelligence</u>, and what is referred to an “angels” are not only the forces and <u>laws</u> of <u>nature</u>, but the forces of imagination, <u>ideas</u>, and even the mind of man.  Furthermore, <u>reality</u> as we know it is formed by these invisible intelligences as well as the <u>intelligence</u> of Man.  He supports his arguments with the <u>ideas</u> of <u>Aristotle</u>, <u>Plato</u>, and even the angles themselves as they are portrayed to conclude that:

> Thus the Sages reveal to the aware, that *the imaginative faculty is also called an angel; and the mind is called a cherub*. How beautiful this will appear to the sophisticated mind – and how disturbing to the primitive.”

He doubles-down on his heretical claims by stating t￼hat <u>reality</u> is controlled by the <u>laws</u> of <u>physics</u>, not by God’s will, most miracles never happened, and perhaps his most egregious claim, that divine providence is non-supernatural, is not given by the grace of God, but is achieved by perfection of the intellect&hellip; and this was 800 years ago!

Of course, telling people that angels are anthropomorphized constructs of forms of <u>intelligence</u> and that they were responsible for their own divine providence not go over so well, and his book was quickly condemned and burned by both Jews and Christians.

This was 800 years ago, but going back as far 2000 years we can see the same sentiment  in the <u>Christian</u> Bible:

> Bible: “For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on <u>earth</u>, visible, and invisible… all things have been created through him and for him”. Colossians 1:16-17 

The <u>tholonic</u> view is identical, only related in terms of <u>tholons</u> and energy:

> Tholonic: “All things exist within the thologram, from <u>concepts</u> to forms.  All things come in to <u>existence</u> through the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> for the sole purpose attaining balance.”

I want to make it very clear that this in no way is meant disparage, disrespect, or even criticize <u>religious</u> beliefs.  The <u>tholonic</u> position is all views, beliefs, perspectives are equally valid, and with each perspective comes certain understandings and limitations. The major difference between the <u>tholonic</u> model and the <u>religious</u> model is a <u>duality</u> between nothing and something vs. the <u>duality</u> between good and <u>evil</u> and that there is no “will of God”, there is only <u>Awareness</u> and Intention.  The <u>tholonic</u> view even recognizes an ultimate creator, that being the <u>Awareness</u> and <u>Intention</u> that all <u>energy</u> comes from.  in fact, if you replace the <u>concept</u> of “God” with “<u>energy</u>”, the “will of God” with “<u>tholons</u> <u>intelligence</u> and “divine beings” with “<u>tholons</u>”, there are remarkable similar.

All <u>tholons</u> are expressions of <u>energy</u> and are created by energy.  <u>Tholons</u> are regulated by <u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u>, and all <u>tholons</u> have the ability to creating more tholons. 

The first <u>tholon</u> within which all other are created could be considered as the God <u>Tholon</u>, but that <u>tholon</u> itself was created by <u>Awareness</u> and <u>Intention</u> which has no traits or characteristics other than A&I. Any <u>concept</u> of a god or divine being that has any traits whatsoever, other than A&I, would by definition be a child <u>tholon</u> that has its own <u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u> and therefore has an agenda of some sort as it requires its own child <u>tholons</u> to exist as well as having to co-exist with its peers and in accordance to its parent.
