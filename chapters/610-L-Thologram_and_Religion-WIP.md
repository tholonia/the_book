# Appendix L: The Thologram and Metaphysics

###### Inner workings of Awareness and Intention

## Tholonic Divinity

The tholonic claim is that our understanding of reality is determined by the context of our understanding of the universally consistent laws.  Because of this, we will see the same patterns through these different cultural lenses.  

Prior to modern science, it was religion that provided that lens, and over thousands of years, inspired and brilliant minds studied and philosophized on the nature of these god-given tenants in an attempt to unveil the mysteries of God, the Universe, and Life.  

Not surprisingly, we can see several parallels between the ancient understanding of God, the creations of God, and the thologram.  One of the more obvious parallels can be seen in the traditional and current Christian model (the Jewish model is similar but not exactly the same) of the hierarchy of Christian saints composed of 9 angelic choirs made up of 3 spheres of responsibility, with each sphere having 3 classes of angels.

This is remarkably similar to the tholonic model but limited to a single tholon.

We can even see how the class of angles fits neatly into the tholonic trinity of *Negotiation/Definition/Contribution* (or *Balance/Limitation/Form*):

- *Negotiation/balance* angels are tasked with care-taking, delivering, and manifesting the will of God.
- *Defining/limiting* angels are tasked with guarding, operating, and watching God’s creations.
- *Contributing/form* angels are the wheels, the warriors, and humanity’s personal guiding angels.

Even more astonishing is that some of the most significant religious philosophers have described this angelic hierarchy in ways that sound perfectly tholonic.  For example, the most respected and influential philosopher and Torah scholar of the Middle Ages, Maimonides (Moses ben Maimon, 1138–1204 CE. Spain), in his book “Guide of the Perplexed”, explains at length how angels are forms of intelligence, and what is referred to as “angels” are not only the forces and laws of nature, but the forces of imagination, ideas, and even the mind of man.  Furthermore, reality as we know it is formed by these invisible intelligences as well as the intelligence of Man.  He supports his arguments with the ideas of Aristotle, Plato, and even the angles themselves as they are portrayed to conclude that:

> Thus, the Sages reveal to the aware that *the imaginative faculty is also called an angel, and the mind is called a cherub*.  How beautiful this will appear to the sophisticated mind – and how disturbing to the primitive.”

He doubles down on his heretical claims by stating that reality is controlled by the laws of physics, not by God’s will and that most miracles never happened.  Perhaps his most egregious claim was that divine providence is non-supernatural and is not given by God’s grace but achieved by the perfection of the intellect&hellip; and this was 800 years ago!

Of course, telling people that angels are anthropomorphized constructs of forms of intelligence and that people were responsible for their own divine providence did not go over so well.  His book was quickly condemned and burned by both Jews and Christians. 

The most fundament tenet of the Judeo-Chrisitan god like a tholonic description:

> Bible: “For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible, and invisible… all things have been created through him and for him”.  Colossians 1:16-17 

> Tholonic: “All things exist within the thologram, from concepts to forms.  All things come into existence through the movement of energy for the sole purpose of attaining balance.”

I want to clarify that this is in no way meant to disparage, disrespect, or even criticize religious beliefs.  The tholonic position is all views, beliefs, and perspectives are equally valid to the degree that they are sustainable, and with each perspective comes certain understandings and limitations.  The significant difference between the tholonic and religious models is a duality of good/evil vs. the duality of nothing/something.  While Judeo-Christianity has a concept of the “will of God”, the thologram has the concept of Awareness and Intention.  The thologram even recognizes an ultimate creator: the Awareness and Intention that is the source of all energy.  In fact, if you replace the concept of “God” with “energy”, the “will of God” with “Intention”, and “tholonic intelligence” and “divine beings” with “tholons”, both models appear remarkably similar.

All tholons are expressions of energy and are created by energy.  Tholons are regulated by tholonic intelligence, and all tholons can create more tholons.  JWFIX[why is this here?]

The 1<sup>st</sup> tholon within which all others are created could be considered as the God Tholon, but that tholon itself was created by Awareness and Intention, which has no traits or characteristics other than A&I. Any concept of a god or divine being that has any traits whatsoever, other than A&I, would by definition be a child tholon that has its own tholonic intelligence and therefore has an agenda of some sort as it requires its own child tholons to exist as well as having to co-exist with its peers and in accordance to its parents context.

## Personal Experiments

As was briefly alluded to earlier in reference to the Taoist *Neidan* meditation practice, tholonic concepts exist in ancient mediations as a way to connect with the *inner energy* of the spirit.  This inner energy has many names, such as; spirit, chi, qi, and prana.   Tholonically, this *inner energy* is the same energy we see daily in the material work, but in a different scope and context.  As all energy is Awareness and Intention, the scope of this energy in meditation is also awareness and intention, but within the contextual limits of human consciousness.  We’ll simply refer to this *inner energy*, this instance of A&I in the context of human consciousness, as “a&I”.

There are many dimensions, techniques, and intentions when it comes to meditation.  These can range from sitting to spinning in circles for hours.  From a tholonic perspective, we want to look at only the single dimension of how mediation can alter the entropy of this *inner energy*. 

Mediation techniques of stilling the mind, disconnecting from the outer world, and emptying oneself entirely are entropy-lowering techniques.  These meditations reduce the number of microstates the mind can explore, creating a less distributed, more focused mind.  This is equivalent to returning the mind to a state of singularity, a state of much lower entropy.  

Meditations that require concentration and focus, such as the meditations of complex mandalas that contain geometric patterns, symbolism, and layers of meaning, are specifically meant to add more microstates for the mind to explore, thereby enhancing the distribution of energy, leading to a more balanced state.  

For example, in Buddhism, there are 2 types of meditations;  *Vipassana* (“insight”) and *Samatha* (“tranquility”).

*Vipassana* (“Insight”) is a state in which the mind is singularly focused on what is happening as it happens and, through the use of concentration of awareness, gradually chipping away at the illusion of this temporary material world that separates him eternal truth of reality.  The technique requires attention to mindful listening, seeing, self-reflection, and testing, making it an entropy-increasing practice.  As this involves the dispersion and decoherence of energy, there is a greater demand on the a&i (i.e., energy), but it coheres the mind.  

Meditations that involve physical exertion and a heightened awareness of one’s surroundings, such as spinning (e.g., Whirling Dervishes) or even running, which can induce a transcendental state, are Vipassana-ish in nature.

*Samatha* (“tranquility”) is a state in which the mind is brought to rest, focused only on one item, such as a prayer, a light, or an image, and not allowed to wander.  This results in a state of rapture, which ends when the meditation is over.  Although this is a temporary state, it is beneficial to one’s state of being and has low energy requirements.  This is an entropy-decreasing practice, as it eliminates many microstates that can dissipate one’s awareness, thus increasing the coherence of one’s a&i (energy).  Meditations that induce trance-like states are *Samatha-ish* in nature.

*Samatha* is the more common form of meditation among Buddhism and other disciplines as well, but *Vipassana* is the oldest of Buddhist meditations, dating back to the days of Buddha himself (563 to 483 B.C.), and was described in a discourse in the *Satipatthana Sutta* (“Foundations of Mindfulness”) attributed to Buddha.

One path leads to the Beginning, and one path leads to the End, which, from an energy perspective, are 2 views from the same “location”, and achieving one state will ultimately lead to the other.  

This “the end is the beginning, the beginning is the end” idea is metaphorically similar to how new Big Bangs (singularities), and the new universe they create, occur within the “nothingness” of black holes (“nothingness” in the sense that no-thing exists in a black hole, as there is no-thing or no-one to observe what is in a black hole, then everything is a just a bunch of un-collapsed wave-functions)
