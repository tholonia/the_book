For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible, and invisible… all things have been created through him and for him.

All things exist within the thologram, from concepts to forms.  All things come in to existence through the movement of energy for the sole purpose attaining balance.

----

god, glory and majesty to him, does not do thongs by direct contact.  god burns things by means of fire; fire is moved by the motion of the sphere; the sphere is moved by means of a disembodied intellect, thgesxe intellects being ‘aggels ’

## about 5

With the reader’s indulgence&hellip; JWFIX: add to this… sounds short and weird

JWFIX: teh following is wrong

Pythagoras said 1 was the mother of all numbers, but if we are going to appley gender to math, the tholinic view expands on this a little and claims that 0 is the “mother” as nothingness is the infinite womb in which everything is born, starting with 1.  1 is the “father”, as it is the initial seed of all numbers, and while not infinite, it it is the unity all that is. 2 is the definer, the limiter, as is splits 1 in half, and is the number of growth. 3 is the final stable form of 0+1+2.  1, 2, and 3 is the trinity *nothignness*, *somethingness*, and *form* , which is not all that diffeent from other well-known trinities of religions and muthology, such as the Hindu’s  creator (Brahman), destroyer (Shiva), and preserver (Vishnu), of Holy Ghost, Father and Son of Christianity, in the tholonic version, the feminine and the masculine *must* come into existance simultaneously. We can even map this trinity to our understandng of energy as a trinity of subatomic particles that are negative (electrons), positive (protons), and neutral (neutrons). 

If we lived in Ancient Greece, woud make 0 and 1 representative of the mother and father of all numbers, and 3 of all that follows.  This view also makes 5 is the first “pure” prime number.  The previous prime numbers serve as the primal archetypes or basis of all other numbers, making 5 the 1<sup>st</sup> prime number that is “just” a prime number.  5 is the 1<sup>st</sup> prime number that has emerged *from* the trinity, as opposed to being *in* the trinity. This makes 5 the first prime number that is exclusively in the domain of form.



As prime numbers are themselves unique “seeds” that are not only core to nature [^398] and the functioning of reality, but to all number as well as every number is a product of prime numbers.  , 5 is the first prime number that is exclusively in the domain of form.  Fir this reason, we woudl expect to see 5 appear in 

[^398]: Loconsole, M., Regolin, L. Are prime numbers special? Insights from the life sciences. *Biol Direct* **17**, 11 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13062-022-00326-w

 which can produce every number that exists  which all living creates seem to be able to recgonize or incorporate in some wat to core to realotyu given that nature appears to and even existance depends on them, pves seeds and does not serve as teh bas (the first “pure” seed, perhaps it is more accurate to say that the 10-base system is in use because it is the most efficient way to merge nature and form, egg and seed, chaos and order.  

<NEW> SECTION>

The relationship between 2 and 5 is very close, so close, that 5 may be the closest value to 2 in how is function.  The reason for this is obvious once we see it.  Whenever we divide anything by 2, it is the same as multiplying by 5 and diving by 10, because 5/10 = $\frac{1}{2}$.  This is why we have a base-10 system today

This 2/5 relationship defines a fundamental pattern in math and in nature which we can see in many instances, including our own 5 fingers in 2 hands; a trait which is common among most species of mammals, and exists in many birds, fish, and insects, going back *pentadactyl tetrapods* Devonian Age 400,000,000 years ago.  Leading experts in the field of human anatomy, developmental biology, and evolution are mystified by this 5-finger phenomena, and can only say:

> “… we simply don't 100% know the 'why' or 'how' of the narrowing of hand morphology to five digit rays in the Devonian.  [Any hypothesis] would be highly speculative without a lot of data on the types of selective pressures organisms at the time were facing… [^348] 

[^348]: **“Ask Evolution: Why Do We Have Five Fingers?”** Topics. Accessed July 9, 2022. https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/science/humans/article/2016/08/01/ask-evolution-why-do-we-have-five-fingers. 

The tholonic view is it is these laws of creation and the patterns they create are the driving force of growth and change *within* the context (of selective or evolutionary pressure) they exist.

This touches on the related concept of weather man-made items are as much a product of nature as anything else, given that mankind is a product of nature.   It is the tholonic position that anything that exists can only be a product of the forces and laws of existence, and therefore is “natural”.  Tupperware, insecticides, genetically modified or invented life forms, computers, AI, cars, nuclear bombs, baseball, mirrors; all these things are as natural as beehives, ant colonies, beaver dams, poisonous volcanic fumes, asteroid collisions, and viruses.  Some creations are simply more sustainable than others.  If we consider that nothing is forever (except energy and maybe black holes), than nothing is ultimately sustainable (except high-entropy chaos).  Just look at our own tiny sliver of reality here on Earth.  In just the short time there has been life on Earth, 99.9% of all species have disappeared.  What percent of everything that ever existed in the Universe turned out to be sustainable? There is no way of knowing, but it’s probably safe to say that what exists now is a very, very small fraction of what has ever existed.  The Universe does not care if we go extinct or even if we destroy the planet, but many of its inhabitants do, as does the planet itself, and by extension our solar system.  There are many forces that have the power to make re-balancing adjustments when, and if, necessary.~~

However, to the best of our current knowledge, entropy is only positive and ever growing in one direction only.  If we were to chart these two dimensions (middle image, below), there would be 

one axis for +chaos  that goes from 1 to 0, and 

one axis for -chaos that goes from 0 to 1.  

We also know that every system starts with lower entropy and ends with higher entropy, which means that every system must start with +chaos and end with -chaos.  This gives us 2 lines; the +chaos, which is the chaos wherein patterns emerge or move from implicit to explicit, and -chaos, wherein patterns disappear, or move from explicit to implicit.  The “zone of order” is the most likely place where order will emerge, with the 0-point in the middle as the point of least chaos, and therefore highest order. 

<IMG src="../Images/chaos-ent-chart3_SINGLE.png" style="float:right;width:20%"/>The image on the right is an attempt to show how chaos and entropy are related, although there are many, many ways this relationship can be shown.  This graph is not meant to be technically accurate, but only conceptually clear.  What it attempts to show is how entropy is 1 dimension of both types of chaos, +chaos and -chaos, between which order exists and which generally describes the life span of any system whether its the universe or a plant.  


As an example, if we consider a hyper-simplified concept of the Big Bang, it would begin at a point of 0 entropy and 1 chaos.  As entropy increases with time, and with the movement of energy in the system, patterns would begin to form, creating order.  This happens in the +chaos side of the curve.  The point of 0 chaos represents the highest level of order that can be achieved. From that point on, the order begins to deteriorate when the loss of energy, due to increasing entropy, is insufficient to maintain the order, and that disintegration or order ends in -1 chaos and 1 entropy.  The values of 1 and 0 are meant to represent the contextual minimums and maximums.

If we merged the 2 dimensions to be on the same plane, which is typically how these two dimensions are shown, we see an interesting pattern that suggests that in some reality connected to ours, time runs backwards, and indeed that is a legitimate hypothesis [^336] , but time is not running backwards in the way you migth think as it’s *anti-time* or *negative-time* existing in a universe of *anti-matter*, and we could exist in such a reality no differently from the one we exist in now as long as all matter, axis, and time were equally inverted.  This is called the *charge, parity, and time (CPT) reversal symmetry*, and it is well understood.  If we woke up tomorrow morning in the *anti-world* version of our current reality we live in now, we would not notice anything different, as long as the CPT was inverted.   This idea is also the basis to William James Sidis’s speculative hypothesis on the reversal of entropy [^370].  The important point being made here is how the same patterns naturally appear, and not which theory is correct, as all of the competing theories that currently exist will continue to change over time.

# CIA paper ref

This concept is neatly summarized in a very insightful analysis report from a very unlikely source, the CIA.  In 1983, the CIA commissioned the U.S Army Intelligence and Security Command (USAINSCOM) to analyze the findings and potential use of recent scientific, albeit bleeding edge, research that involved humans consciousness, out-of-body travel, super-intelligence, psychic and psychedelic perception, telepathy, and even time-travel along with a number of alternative paradigms of reality.  This report was classified for 20 years [^372], but was republished by McDonnall along with university of Pennsylvania researcher and Rowan university math professor and author, Sky Waterpeace

<IMG src="../Images/chaos-trigram-2.png" style="float:right;width:30%"/>As this process of emergence and decay of order applies to any system, then it also applies to not just the life of the universe, but the life of all the systems created in the universe, and the systems that those systems create, etc., etc., making reality a dynamic fractal of countless embedded systems of  *low entropy chaos &rarr; order&rarr; high entropy chaos*.  We can see this same pattern in a rotated version of the prior tetrahedral image that showed how chaos is fundamental to low and high entropy as well as the *cause* that creates child systems.  

The apple on the shelf follows the same rules as the universe, as did the tree, weather, planet, solar system, etc., that made the existence of that apple possible.

 Coincidentally, the middle of the natural log of *c<sup>2</sup>* is also *c*, i.e., $e^{\ln(c^2)/2}=c$, but this is the case with any squared value whose log is divided by 2 because $e^{\ln(n^2)/2}=n$).  This is more than just a mathematical coincidence.  If the natural neares of growth is logorithmic, then teh square of any measure represents the 2 identical axis that define that measure, the ‘space’ of that measure, so to speak.  Likewise, median of that logarithmic space will always equal the value fo the measure.  The same for cubes

### Elements of a Tholonic Experiment

What do we claim about tholons that we could use to create new tests?

- The tholonic concept of the source of energy is SAI.
- Tholons have consciousness, intention, and intelligence.
- Tholons, once created, will always tend towards self-preservation via a balanced state.
- Tholonic predicates, or dynamic attributes, act like a magnetic field, can transfer information, and can’t effect mass.
- Tholonic objects, or static attributes, act like an electric field, can’t transfer information, but can exert a force on mass.
- All instances below that of space-time will follow the arrow-of-time, e.g. “person eats apple” moves in only one direction because the predicate/dynamic “eats” is irreversible.  While and person can’t un-eat an apple, tholonically “apple eats person” is also valid archetype, albeit one whose instantiation is rare and/or not obvious (but this may be changing thanks to the *biodegradable burial-pod project*[^347]).
- Tholons “above” space-time are not limited by physical constants, such as speed-of-light, but their instances are.
- Tholons have a data store, but instances of that data is limited by whatever that store is (i.e. speed-of-light transmission, entropy), which can only exist within the space-time tholon.
- One tholon can have more than one instantiation.
- Tholonic instances are “entangled” within a tholon, meaning inter-instance communication is instantaneous, but only on the archetypal level, not among their material instances.  This means information between two physical instances is limited by space-time, but is instantaneous between their archetypes.
- Tholons are fractal and self-similar.
- Tholons contain a thesis, an antithesis, and can produce a synthesis.
- A stable tholon must have balanced energy, i.e, energy in equals energy out.  Unstable tholons do not need to be balanced within themselves, but the difference in energy must come form somewhere or go somewhere, and they are (probably) short-lived.
- A tholon has 4 attributes: 1) a source of energy, 2) contextual limits on expression (of energy),  3) output or transformation (of energy), 4) movement (of energy)
- The archetype of a tholon is a tetrahedron, whose archetypes is a trigram.  The trigram is a pattern formed by 3 properties 1) a stable pattern of energy, 2) definition/limitation, and 3) contribution/integration. 
- Tholons have fields made of two parts that are, in their most primal form, SAI, or the field of its existence and the field of the movement of energy through its existence.  This is similar to an electric field and a magnetic field.  The field of Intention (movement) can transfer energy.  The field of Awareness can transfer information.  Because it has fields, it also has induction and conduction, therefore,  tholonic objects can create predicates, and predicates can create objects, e.g. electric fields can create magnetic fields and vise versa.  The same is (or appears to be) true for cause/effect, energy/mass, space/time, etc., all of which are instances of Awareness/Intention.
- Tholons preserve their path from the first instance, the primal tholon, to its current instance.
- Each tholon has (at least) 5-dimensions; the 4 coordinates of a synergetic/quadray coordinate system, plus time.

- As the thologram instantiates as a tetrahedron/tetrahedral matrix, material that is also tetrahedral in nature (water, certain minerals and crystals) is probably the easiest to work with.

beginning with (I I ) “I Am That I Am” is also interpreted as “I Am What I Am” or “I Am Who I Am”.   Yes, it is also intpreted as ‘I Am Who I Am”, but that is both concpetually, linguistically, and raciually inaccurate, and has more to do with the human need to anthropomophize everything.  A great deal of the meaning in English or Greek translations of the original text comes from the decisions of the translators, and considering scholars have spent years analyzing the significance of the first letter of the Torah, and even more years on the first word, it’s safe to say that the true meaning of the original phrase is still being deciphered and a true translations would require volumes.  While this may be true, both statements stand on their own in English, regardless where it originated form, but rather than being synonymous, they are, tholonically, quite different, even opposite of each other on one sense.  



While “I Am That I Am” apples t the source of creations, “I Am What I Am” applies only to that which is, or has been, created, making *Popeye the Sailor Man* a far better icon than that of the Creator.  



Believe it or not, there is more commentary that one would imagine on the difference between these two phrases, mostly intent on making it clear that Jehovah and Popeye are quite different.  Having never met either, I have no opinion, but I am quiet clear on the difference between the word “what” and “that”.  Without getting into the etymology and various contextual meaning of those words, or the crippling limitations of English when interpreting ancient languages like Hebrew, Sanskrit, and other semantically complex languages (albeit syntactically less evolved), in our context the word “that” refers to a specific subset of the whole, whatever that happens to be, and the word “what” refers to the context of “that”.

For purpoese of testing, we’ll start with teh prusumtion that Awanress alone is pure energym but energy that has no movement, and Intentions is the movement of that.



A complete tholon is tetrahedral in nature, meaning it has 3 axis formed by 3 pairs that are perpendicular to each other.  These axis represent 3 perspectives of the tholon.  

In its most abstract form, these 3 axis represent 1 *instance*. These points represent a 0-dimensional concept and the 2 expressions of that concept that define its scope.  In this sense, these 2 expressions are conceptually “perpendicular” to each other.  It is within, or between, these 2 limits that the concept s must instantiate.  These opposite poles can be thesis/antithesis, positive/negative, high/low, hot/cold, or any pair that defines a scope of any type.

~~In the most metaphysical sense, the concept of the 0D point as existence is simply one of *being*, the awareness of “I Am”.  Intention is implied by the reasonable presumption that some movement must have been initiated for the 0D dot to exist in the first place, and that movement is always preceded by an intention.  This movement is therefore inherent in all descend from this 0D point, and which we understand as energy.~~  

~~As~~



~~If the reader will indulge me for a moment, I would like to take a slight detour to clear up seemingly insignificant grammatical misunderstanding which will also prove to be an effective linguistic description of the thologram.~~ 

As energy is Awareness and Intention, we would expect to see the 2 poles of Awareness and Intention that define the spectrum of creation in the expression of energy, and we do in the polarities that define each scope of existence, starting with *time* and *space*.  Which is an instance of which is debatable, or perhaps even pointless, although *Intention* does imply *time*, and though *Awareness* does not imply *space*, per se, it does imply a point, which implies space.  

One of the instances of energy is electricity, and it, too, as its own pair or instances; the electric field and magnetic field.  Both fields have their respective pairs of positive and negative forces, which is required for a field to exist.  One could argue that it is the positive/negative forces that create the fields, but the tholonic view is that is it the creation of a field that allows for the instances of +/- charges.

When are have only 2 axis, we typically consdier them as perpendicular (⊥) to each other yo understadbns how they interatci with each other tp create a 3rd context.  Awareness and Intions defined energy before is instantiates, like a energy archetypes.  , or when we can call when we can call existance, or being, property, such as how space and time define movement, magnetism and charge define electricity, negative and pisitive define fields, etc., all fo which come form Awareness and Intention that define being.

We csee this 

, such as how we plot x/y charts, and 

<img src="../Images/evolution3.png" style='float:right;width:15%'>**Awareness** ⬌ ** ⬌ **Intention⥤** “*that which is*”:  This describes existence itself as “that which is”.  If we used the more personal “I Am” concept rather than “is”, we could say :” I do, therefore I am”, or ”I am, therefore I do”.  

**Time** ⬌ *which is* ⬌ **space⥤** *energy*: Energy, as we define it, only exists in space-time as energy requires movement, and space-time is the fabric of this reality. 

**Magnetic field** ⬌ *energizes* ⬌ **electric field** ⥤ *polarity*: The movement of energy (oscillation) creates two fields fields.  This is how most our electricity is produced.

**Negative charge** ⬌ *polarized* ⬌ **positive charges** ⥤ *electricity*: The existence of polarity is what allows for the instance of positive and negative charges

We tend to think in a object-centric manner, so we think of “eats” or “fills” as something that one object does to another.  The tholonic predicate-centric view is that “eats” or “fills” are concepts that gets instantiated via relationships between objects.   It is time and space that allow for the instantiation of energy, just like it is “person” and “apple” that allow for the instantiation of the concept ”eat”.  Every relationship, or predicate, requires 2 objects to instantiate itself. 

As a tholon, the instantiation of the concept of energy would look something like the image below where there is a 1) cause and effect, 2) spectrum of time, and 3) spectrum of space.   Cause and effect are contextual, e.g. energy/mass, action/reaction, impulse/waves, etc.  The time/space axis allows for the expression of energy, or movement.  They are the “verbs”, or “predicates”, but the cause/effect axis are the “nouns” or “objects”.  The movement of energy is what causes a magnetic field, and that field is capable to transmitting information yet not capable of applying a force of mass.  Geometrically, it is these dynamic lines of space and time that form the connections between the object properties of cause and effect.  For this reason, we consider space and time to be information-carrying fields.  The object attributes of cause/effect fields can not carry information but can exert a force on matter/energy, and like the electric field and unlike the magnetic field, can exist even when there is no movement of energy.  This is because the source fo the energy exists before there is movement, that source being the forces of Awareness and Intentions, which, which combined, we have called “That which is”, the first instance of the primal impulse of “is”.

<img src="../Images/blender-tholon.png" style='float:right;width:25%'>The diagrams below also show an arrow-of-time, or direction of entropy, as *space* and *time* only move in one direction, away from *cause* and towards *effect*, and both *time* and *space* converge to space-time at the point of *effect*.  The only way *cause* can connect to *effect* is via *space* and *time*.  *Space* and *time* also have two states, shown as *SPACE* and *space*, and *TIME* and *time*.  These represent the beginning and ending state of each property; beginning, or lower entropy *TIME* and/or *SPACE*, and final, or higher entropy *time* and/or *space*.  The same applies to the predicate, in this case the lower entropy *CAUSE* and the higher entropy *effect*.  This pattern is consistent with physics as we know that entropy increases as time flows forward, as does any movement through space.  So space-time represents the change in entropy, and *CAUSE*/*effect* represents the beginning and ending states of entropy.  However, as no part of the tholon can exist independent of any other part, this model also suggests that the existence of an *effect* must instantiate a *CAUSE*.  There is nothing in the tholon that prevents an effect from being instantiated first, which suggest that a *CAUSE* could be the result of an *effect*, which also implies that the past can be changed depending on the present.  How one can create an effect without there first being a *CAUSE* is another question, but as there is one state that exists prior to the instantiation of space-time, that state being one of Awareness and Intention, perhaps there is a way, but that “way” would have to be transcendental to space-time, and therefore this entire physical reality as we know it.
