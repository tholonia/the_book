#   INTRODUCTION

The concept that this reality is an illusion, a matrix, a simulation, or a dream is not new.--         From the earliest creation stories of “*God created the heavens and the earth*” to our modern version of the “*Simulation Hypothesis*”, the creation story has been the same.-- It goes something like this: Once upon a time, there was nothing, and within that nothingness, something appeared.  The details are left to be filled in by the imagination of scientists, mystics, philosophers, and poets, all seeking insight into the meaning and purpose of life, or at least a clue letting us know if we exist to merely survive, or to find happiness, to love, to win, to suffer, or to discover that Zorba the Greek knew the truth all along when he said: “Life is what you do while you’re waiting to die”.  After all, our existence and reality may be the ultimate and only one, or maybe just be a dream within a dream.  This book does not attempt to answer any of these questions any more than a radio’s manual can tell you what’s being broadcast.  This does not mean that it *doesn’t* answer these questions, but the “answers” can mean many things to many people.

“Tholonia” is meant to describe the blueprint of creation, similar to a blueprint to a house, which only speaks to how a house is built, not what happens inside the house, how it will be used, or who did the actual building.--         For those who believe life is a journey towards enlightenment, this is the blueprint of that path.-- For those who believe they are enslaved in a matrix, this is the blueprint of that prison.  For those who believe life is a dream, this is the blueprint of the mind of the dreamer.  While the ideas and conclusions put forth apply to society and culture, as well as science, politics, economics, self-realization, consciousness, and life itself, I attempted to avoid social and cultural biases as much as possible, and where they do exist, I keep them to a minimum.  The overarching concept being presented is the idea that the mechanics of existence and reality, from atoms to cultures to galaxies, all follow the same laws and have the same structure as it applies to their context.

While this book is the result of years of investigation, research, and testing, it is still, and will always be, a work in progress.--         The book itself is part of that research, as it presents a hypothesis, along with proofs, speculations, assumptions, deductions, and questions, all of which could benefit from corrections, improvements, tests, and general finessing from the community at large.--

The conclusions in this book are my own, drawn from connecting the dots laid out in the following pages.--         It is not my intention to promote my conclusions but rather use them as examples of how one person has connected these dots.-- It is these *dots* that give clues to the structure of reality and existence, but as there are countless dots, there are innumerable perspectives and understandings.  How we connect them is a subjective experience, so you may connect these dots differently, or you may not see anything worth connecting at all; just a bunch of random concepts that have no relationship to one another (although I doubt you’d be reading this if that was the case). 

This book is written in the style of an argumentative proposal.--         Despite its occasional meandering, the progression of concepts presented attempts to maintain continuity with (hopefully) clear points, references, and a (somewhat) logical order of subjects.-- It is also an exploration into new territory that I am certainly not an expert in.  That is why this book is open-sourced; to allow others’ insights and knowledge to be integrated with the hope that a clearer picture of the mechanics of existential awareness will continue to evolve and emerge, allowing for corrections and updates.

**On a more mundane note…**

Please read *Appendix A, “About This Book”* to understand why this book is written using an unconventional style of punctuation, grammar, and spacing.--         It also addresses some technical eBook issues that the reader may find distracting.--
