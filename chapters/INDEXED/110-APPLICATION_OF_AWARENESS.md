# Part III
~~Part I of this book introduces the <u>ideas</u> and <u>concepts</u> that form the vocabulary later used to describe the <u>tholonic</u> model presented.  These are not esoteric or niche <u>concepts</u>, but the most fundamental <u>concepts</u> known to <u>science</u>, such as <u>energy</u>, <u>chaos</u>, <u>order</u>, <u>waves</u>, and Newton’s Laws.  As we review these basic <u>concepts</u>, we also expand on them and build new <u>concepts</u> that will be critical in describing what role <u>awareness</u> plays in the theater of <u>existence</u>, how and why <u>consciousness</u> *had* to evolve, and the <u>nature</u> of intelligence; artificial, human, or otherwise.~~

# 11: APPLICATION OF <u>AWARENESS</u>

###### Experiments in <u>Awareness</u>

## Mythology

It may seem odd that *mythology* would be placed in the chapter of how <u>awareness</u> is/can be applied in the real world, but beliefs of any sort are excellent examples of the application of awareness.  Beliefs are perhaps the most common way to channel <u>awareness</u> as they can cohere the otherwise undirected and unrestrained awareness.  In this way, beliefs act like the point of *Definition* in the <u>tholonic</u> trinity, putting restrictions on how that <u>awareness</u> is expressed.  Considering this, it is no wonder that mythologies so closely reflected the <u>archetypes</u> of creation.  From the <u>tholonic</u> view, it was/is the <u>intelligence</u> of these <u>archetypes</u> that vie for that <u>awareness</u> within the arena of human consciousness. Mythologies and beliefs are the earliest form of Man's *conscious will* to have a hand in the creation of his reality.

It may sound childish or even superstitious to suggest that <u>archetypes</u> can have intentions that can result in conflicting and/or cooperative relationships, which implies allies and enemies, and therefore some sort of diplomacy and politics.  In one sense it is childish, in that it leaves so much open to the imagination. In another sense it is childish because beliefs in general are an early form of learning how to use the power of awareness.  Beliefs are the Legos of awareness.  Beliefs are also placeholders that fill in the blanks of our limited <u>understanding</u> of the mechanics of <u>awareness</u>, <u>intention</u>, and <u>intelligence</u>, which is also why they have such a significant effect on our <u>understanding</u> of reality.  

The ancient myths provided a pretty effective way to understand the workings of <u>reality</u>, given the context and <u>scope</u> of our abilities when they were created.  We see these gods and their unending dramas as anthropomorphized <u>concepts</u> of <u>tholonic</u> intelligences and their interactions. As previously stated, <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetypes</u>, like the gods themselves, are autonomous agents in a self-reproducing system.  To get a general idea of the Mexican-soap-opera-of-psychopaths-on-steroids that was the <u>life</u> of the Gods, see *Appendix D*, “*Greek Gods*”  It is short, and quite entertaining.

These two charts compare the <u>hierarchy</u> of the Greek Gods (according to Gaius Julius Hyginus, a scholar born in 64 B.C.) and the same <u>hierarchy</u> of one of many <u>archetypes</u> represented by that deity.

## Sensing <u>Intention</u>

The idea that plants, and presumably other <u>life</u> forms, are sensitive to the feelings and intentions of others within their sphere of influence is not a new idea.  There still exists debate as to  the validity of the *Backster Effect*[^300],(which was evidence that supports the hypothesis that plants not only respond to physical and chemical stimuli, but that they are capable of knowing the emotions and thoughts of entities around them), and similar popular <u>ideas</u>, such as those in the book *The Secret <u>Life</u> of Plants*, but at the very least, this is an area worthy of more investigation.  The <u>tholonic</u> view is that everything that exists is part of a *Vast Active Living <u>Intelligence</u> System* (to borrow the title of a book by author Phillip K. Dick) that we are calling the Thologram, and consequently, everything *must* be connected to everything else in some way and form.  As our <u>knowledge</u> and our ability to share that <u>knowledge</u> expands, our <u>understanding</u> of <u>reality</u> so too will expand, and in many different directions.  Multiple theories, philosophies, practices, will not only emerge, but each will have their own body of evidence supporting that model. Some will flourish and others will wither away. This is the <u>evolution</u> of perspective.  

Similar to the "Can you prove Australia exists?" problem, at some point we need to choose what or who to *believe* as true or not. While the Backster Effect is soundly grounded in <u>tholonic</u> principles, that alone is not enough to accept it as real.  Perhaps the most convincing support comes from one of the more ingenious scientists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Marcel Vogel.    

Marcel Vogel  (1917 - 1991) was a research scientist for IBM’s San Jose facility for 27 years and was granted a <u>number</u> of patents, from hard-disk <u>magnetic</u> coatings to egg testing.  At age six he was pronounced dead from double lobar pneumonia. He claimed that while he was “dead” he experienced a light and a sense of <u>love</u> and well being that was overwhelming, and this formed the underlying fabric of his <u>life</u> and beliefs. 

With the aid of IBM's state-of-the-art equipment, he replicated the Backster Effect.  Below is the polygraph results that he said made him a “believer”.

<img src='../Images/Cleve_Backster_2.png' style='width:100%'/>

Vogel even lectured at IBM on the subject of "Do Plant Have Emotions?", which, in 1969, was a radical concept.  He experimented with plants for some time and discovered a <u>number</u> of very odd and “unscientific” facts.  For example; 

- It was observed that when he released his breath slowly there was virtually no response from the plant, but when he pulsed his breath through the nostrils, as he held a thought in mind, the plant would respond dramatically. 
- The plant's response was the same regardless of distance, as the results were the same when he was in San Jose (where his lab and the plant were), or in Prague, Czechoslovakia.  This also suggests that <u>coherent</u> thought acts similarly to <u>coherent</u> <u>energy</u> in that it can travel over long distanced without loosing power.  
- Plants appeared to respond more to the threat of damage than to the actual damage itself.
- Plants appeared to have many of the same properties as batteries, especially when it came to their interactions with thoughts.
- It was observed that the attitude, or mind-set, of the experimenter had a measurable effect upon the test-results.  This might shed some light on the inconsistent result of the “water <u>memory</u>” experiments of Jacques Benveniste, as related previously.
- He concluded from these experiments that he “learned that there is <u>energy</u> connected with thought. Thought can be pulsed and the <u>energy</u> connected with it becomes <u>coherent</u> and has a laser-like power.”

Because of his young near-death-experience, Marcel believed that the greatest cohering agent is love.  This may be correct.  The <u>tholonic</u> view is that *<u>intention</u>* is the basis of <u>reality</u> and creation, but says nothing about what that <u>intention</u> *is*.  The <u>tholonic</u> position is that *any* <u>intention</u> is equally valid.  However, it's reasonable to imagine that some intentions are more effective than others, and it is reasonable that the <u>intention</u> of <u>love</u> may be the most sustainable.

Such <u>ideas</u> did not endear him to the scientific community, but this discovery opened many new doors of investigation for Marcel, especially in the areas of <u>crystals</u> and water, with some very impressive (anecdotal) results.  Needless to say, this not only set him apart from his fellow scientists, but ensured his obscurity.

## Maharishi Effect

Given the general direction of mainstream <u>science</u>, we do not see a lot of investigation into how thought affects external <u>reality</u>, but some do exist *(see items 3 and 4 in "Other Experiments" list below)*.  We will look at one research report here, *“Effects of Group Practice of the <u>Transcendental</u> Meditation Program on Preventing Violent Crime in Washington, D. C.: Results of the National Demonstration Project, June-July 1993”*[^160] published in the journal *“Social Indicators Research.”*

This study, which was monitored by a 27-member project review board comprised of independent scientists and leading citizens, found that there was a significant statistical result.

What was this study exactly?

> This study presents the final results of a two-month prospective experiment to reduce violent crime in Washington, DC.  On the basis of previous research, it was hypothesized that the level of violent crime in the District of Columbia would drop significantly with the creation of a large group of participants in the <u>Transcendental</u> Meditation® and TM-Siddhi® programs to increase <u>coherence</u> and reduce stress in the District.[^161]

Here, the word “<u>coherence</u>” refers to its definition of “*the quality of forming a unified whole*.”

<img src='../Images/medchart.png' style='FLOAT:RIGHT;width:40%'/>The results were impressive.

This is only one study, so it is not definitive, but it is certainly supportive of the idea that directed <u>intention</u>, what the participants called *<u>coherence</u>*, and what we are calling *<u>order</u>* (as that is what unifies the parts into the whole), has an extended effect.  The explanation, according to the <u>tholonic</u> model, is that the directed <u>energy</u> of <u>coherent</u> thought altered the curves of various <u>archetypes</u> thereby altering the probability of where the “<u>work</u>” will produce the most <u>order</u>, or where and how <u>energy</u> will be expressed across a <u>scope</u>’s spectrum.

### On a Personal Note

I had a particularly insightful experience with the Maharishi Effect back in the late ’60s when I was a young teenager.  My father was a captain of industry in the world of electrical components, ultimately becoming president of one of the pioneering companies that helped create the first integrated circuit.

Born of poor Scottish immigrants in the Bronx on the tail of the Great Depression, and serving in Korea, he was no stranger to hard times and hard <u>work</u>, which made him one of the most pragmatic and practical people I have ever known.  He was a devout capitalist, atheist, and husband, and had no patience for anything that did not produce results.  Hippies were idiots, imports were ruining the economy, Scotch whiskey was better, and talking about your problems was for whiners.  You get the picture.

At the insistence of his wife (and my mother), he joined her for a seminar on *Creative <u>Intelligence</u> (CI)*, which was what they called <u>Transcendental</u> Meditation back then for those folks like my father.  He heard their claims about improved mental and physical <u>health</u>, better focus, fewer distractions, etc.  He decided to test their claims by giving all his employees in one of his factories CI training, along with an extra half-hour at lunch break for them to take this training and practice their new CI skills.

This factory was in a poor, rundown industrial town in New England, and the people that worked in those factories were uneducated, unskilled, assembly-line laborers - not exactly an open-minded demographic.  I knew a <u>number</u> of them myself, as we lived in that town, and many never made it past 4<sup>th</sup> grade.  The rivers in this town were dead from all the pollution, and the neighboring town had the highest *per capita* <u>suicide</u> rate in the United States.  It was a dreary, dark place filled with dreary, dark people.

His peers in the industry thought he was being foolish to deploy such a plan, but the results were astounding.  People were fighting less, taking less sick leave, injuries were down, production went up; in general, everything improved.  So much so, that the Wall Street Journal did an article on him and his “revolutionary” new technique.  He became known as some kind of New Age Industrialist, which was ironically funny as he was as new age as his ’57 Chevy.

Ultimately, this new <u>concept</u> was unsustainable in that environment because eventually people began to abuse the extra time meant for CI, and everything went back to *normal* with sick leaves, fighting, injuries, and lower production, so the program was scrapped.

## Prayer

You might be thinking that traditional prayer holds the same power, but it does not.  Why? Because most prayer is anything but coherent.  Prayer means very different things depending on <u>culture</u>, <u>religion</u>, personal perspectives, etc.  Perhaps this is a side-effect of monotheism, which eliminated the myriad of niche gods.  In any case, prayer can be anything from begging to demanding, justifying to virtue signaling, and occasionally it can be an expression of gratitude and <u>love</u>, but using group prayer to effect change is like using a group of blind people to paint a room by throwing handfuls of paint at the wall.  Your room *will* get painted, but you’ll wish it didn’t.

This was recently confirmed by a &dollar;2.3-million-dollar study on the effect of prayer on the sick, involving over 1,800 patients.  It was the largest study of its kind ever undertaken.  Contrary to prayer helping the sick, they found that when a patient knew others were praying for them, they tended to have *more* complications.[^162]

There are other studies that conclude the exact opposite, such as Dr.  Byrd’s study “*Positive Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer in a Coronary Care Unit Population*”[^163] and Dr.  Harris’s  study “*A <u>Randomized</u>, Controlled Trial of the Effects of Remote, Intercessory Prayer on Outcomes in Patients Admitted to the Coronary Care Unit*”[^164].  However, without a detailed comparison of the studies, and specifically the manner in which the participants prayed, we cannot know to what degree <u>coherence</u> was at play.

The difference between the <u>coherence</u> of <u>Transcendental</u> Meditation and prayer is the former follows a very specific set of rules, has a beginning, a middle and an end, has a clearly defined non-personal target subject, and never attempts to <u>force</u> change.  Prayer can follow these same rules, but it rarely does because there are no rules to prayer and varies greatly depending on <u>culture</u>, tradition, perspective, <u>intention</u>, etc.

The practice of *<u>coherent</u> prayer* is common among metaphysical secret societies.  For example, in the not-so-secret secret <u>society</u> of the *<u>Order</u> of the Rosy Cross*, or *Rosicrucians*,  members who have reached a certain level of initiation are introduced to a schedule of “prayers”. This is a globally synchronized schedule of times when people are requested to focus their <u>energy</u> on a particular topic, such as <u>health</u> or <u>family</u> or finances, and in a specific manner.  If one is not in need, they send their gratitude into a “pool” of <u>energy</u> specific to that topic.  If one has a need in these areas they can join in at the scheduled times and “tap into” that pool.  This is a very <u>coherent</u> technique because it has specific <u>archetypes</u> and directed <u>energy</u>, which then creates <u>sustainable</u> <u>patterns</u>, and it (reportedly) works surprisingly well.

The effect of the *<u>Consciousness</u> <u>Field</u>*, as it is referred to by Roger Nelson of Princeton University and director of *The Global <u>Consciousness</u> Project*, is not limited to <u>humans</u>, but can affect matter and machines *(see first two items listed below under “Other Experiments”).*

## Thought

If we are looking at meditation, prayer, and other forms of <u>coherent</u> thought, we have to also look at the <u>concept</u> of <u>entropy</u> because <u>coherence</u> is *lower* in <u>entropy</u> than incoherence, just as a laser light is lower in <u>entropy</u> that normal diffuse light.  This suggests that the act of meditation, prayer, concentration, focus, and even attention in general, creates a lower <u>entropy</u> state from a higher <u>entropy</u> state, which is a blatant violation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>Law</u> of <u>Thermodynamics</u>!  While it was shown that the 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>Law</u> is not really a <u>law</u> but a statistical probability, the probability of breaking that <u>law</u> is supposed to be extremely unlikely, but here we see we can break that <u>law</u> whenever we like under almost any conditions.

From a <u>thermodynamic</u> perspective, focus, concentration, prayer, etc., only uses 0.65 <u>calories</u> an hour, at most, which means a single chocolate chip cookie could power a year’s worth of meditation if one meditated 20 minutes a day, and yet focused thinking is what accounts for pretty much everything mankind has created since he thought ”hmm… sharp stone… long stick… what if?” 500,000 years ago.  This is a similar argument to the question “How can a system become more organized (i.e. <u>evolution</u>) in an ever increasingly chaotic system (i.e., <u>reality</u>)?”.  This argument is called the *<u>Schrödinger</u> paradox*, as it was introduced to the world by Erwin <u>Schrödinger</u> in 1933 in his book “What is <u>Life</u>?”.  But, <u>Schrödinger</u> had the answer (So, I guess it’s more of a rhetorical question, despite it being called a paradox), and goes something like the following paragraph.

The 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>Law</u> only applies to *closed* systems, where no <u>energy</u> can enter or leave.  <u>Life</u>, at least on <u>Earth</u>, is an *open* system, as we get lots of <u>energy</u> from the sun, and our solar system is an open system as it gets <u>energy</u> from the galaxy.  In practical terms , the <u>Universe</u> as a whole is the only closed system (that we know of) in nature.  So, the <u>evolution</u> and <u>self-organizing</u> of <u>life</u> *appears* to break the 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>Law</u>, but doesn’t *really* because it’s getting more <u>energy</u> from the sun that it expends evolving and self-organizing.   Scientists refer to this external <u>energy</u> as *free-energy*. 

Does this mean that a system can <u>self-organize</u> as long as the resulting increase in local <u>entropy</u> is less than the free-energy it receives?  And even if that were so, why *would* it <u>self-organize</u> in the first place? 

~~In the old days, when there was plenty of blobs of carbon-based bio-goo, but before <u>life</u> existed, the bio-goo blobs were getting a lot of this free-energy.  According to the <u>laws</u> of <u>energy</u>, they needed to expend the same amount of <u>energy</u> they took in, but carbon-based blobs have no special energy-dissipation abilities, at least not as blobs.  As <u>energy</u> moves through the blobs, the blobs will naturally reorganize to allow for the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>, and as the blobs can only absorb so much <u>energy</u>, excess <u>energy</u> will naturally dissipate.  This <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> within the blobs formed <u>patterns</u>, and these <u>patterns</u> became what we have come to know as life.  This is (perhaps) why the earliest forms of <u>life</u> are believed to be 4+ billion year old microorganisms that formed on the hydro-thermal vents on the ocean floor that spew out boiling hot water in .  That heat was their source of free-energy, and it delivered significantly more <u>energy</u> than the sun.  The earliest direct evidence of <u>life</u> are the 3.5 billion-year-old microfossels found on  the hot water vents in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.~~

~~According to Jeremy England, a 31-year-old assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who derived a mathematical formula[374]that explains how the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> can convert a carbon-based blob into a <u>life</u> form:~~

>  ~~You start with a <u>random</u> clump of <u>atoms</u>, and if you shine light on it for long enough, it should not be so surprising that you get a plant.~~

~~We see this also in non-carbon blobs, for example, self-assembling <u>crystals</u> and quasi-crystals.~~

Now, the idea that <u>coherent</u> thought appears to violate the 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>Law</u> makes more sense if we accept that <u>consciousness</u> is an open system receiving free-energy from the Source <u>Awareness</u> and <u>Intention</u> (SAI), and while <u>consciousness</u> is a contextual instance of SAI, we can also understand it as the result of the need to dissipate the free-energy of the SAI we are exposed to, just as the carbon-based blobs were exposed to energy.  Still, if the answer was that simple, it would not explain why the willful act of thinking, or even the instinctual act of focusing attention, could so easily decrease <u>entropy</u> (less dissipation) when the goal of <u>energy</u> would be to increase dissipation (more <u>entropy</u>).

Incoherence is <u>nature</u>’s first choice when it comes to the distribution and <u>balancing</u> of <u>energy</u>, but we can find examples of <u>coherent</u> transmissions of <u>energy</u> as well, mainly between <u>molecules</u> involved with <u>photosynthesis</u>, microtubules, quantum <u>energy</u> transfer, and possibly mitochondria, <u>bacteria</u>, and  plant chloroplasts (part of plant <u>cell</u> that converts light into chemical <u>energy</u>).  This natural <u>coherence</u> is more common  to the micro-world, and is also of very short duration, but it exists because it is a far more efficient way to transfer a specific amount of <u>energy</u> to a specific target.  Just as the <u>energy</u> emissions of the blob required a more organized, more <u>structured</u>, more <u>coherent</u> <u>pattern</u> to efficiently move <u>energy</u>, molecular and quantum processes also require a more <u>coherent</u> and efficient form of <u>energy</u> transfer for the same reason.  The difference between the two instances is the <u>nature</u> of the energy; heat vs. light.

If we accept this new theory of <u>life</u>, then we also have to accept that the <u>evolution</u> of <u>life</u>, which includes <u>DNA</u> <u>information</u> storage and retrieval systems, is also a by-product of, and for, the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>, and that sounds like a pretty big leap.  However, self-assembling <u>crystals</u> and quasi-crystals exist and are the subject of much research.  <u>DNA</u> self-assembles in the same manner, and many self-assembling quasi-crystals *are* DNA.  if we consider that the primary function of anything that exists is to remain in <u>existence</u>, to maintain a stable <u>pattern</u> of <u>energy</u> within the context of its <u>existence</u>, then these once carbon-based blogs would first need to create a synergetic relationship with its surrounding; i.e., it will need to consume or assimilate resources and <u>contribute</u> something of equal or more value back to its context or environment.

<u>Schrödinger</u> also observed that: 

> An organism's astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of <u>order</u>' on itself and thus escaping the decay into <u>atomic</u> <u>chaos</u> - of 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environment - seems to be connected with the presence of the 'aperiodic solids', the <u>chromosome</u> <u>molecules</u>, which doubtless represent the highest degree of well-ordered <u>atomic</u> association we know of - much higher than the ordinary periodic <u>crystal</u> …

In other words, the ability for living organisms to increase <u>coherence</u>, reduce dispersion, (i.e., reduce <u>entropy</u>) seems to be connected with the meta-crystals of <u>DNA</u> (i.e. <u>information</u>).

It is the <u>DNA</u> of <u>life</u> forms that determines how it will manage not only the <u>sustainability</u> of an organism, but also the transmission of <u>energy</u>, especially *free-energy*, and as all the organs, including the <u>brain</u>, come into <u>existence</u> and grow in accordance with the rules recorded in the <u>DNA</u>, we can say that the entire organism and its parts exist because of <u>DNA</u> and are design to optimize existing <u>energy</u> and dissipate excess energy.

If we are constantly being “energized” or “irradiated” by the omnipresence of SAI, how are we dissipating all the excess “<u>energy</u>” we are exposed to?  Through increasingly complex systems of dissipation, such as <u>consciousness</u>, meta-consciousness, and the systems they “self-assemble”. “self-assemble” is in quotes because from a Universal perspective, everything that did, does or will exist is self-assembled.

As <u>pattern</u> and <u>order</u> become more complex, interconnected, and efficient, <u>coherent</u> exchange of <u>energy</u> will become more common.  Rain is a very efficient way to distribute water, and in the past, <u>humans</u> would hope for rain to water the plants that they foraged.  <u>Coherent</u> attempts were made to invoke the rain, such as praying, dancing, and sacrificing, and while there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this technique, <u>humans</u> eventually discovered a far more <u>coherent</u> and efficient technique that resulted in far more efficient production;  plumbing and irrigation, because <u>coherently</u> managed and directed water does better job of growing plants than unmanageable, unpredictable rain. (*Note: This is not an endorsement or modern irrigation techniques which can be irresponsible and environmentally damaging.  This is just a comparison of <u>coherent</u> vs <u>incoherent</u> systems*).

We are <u>partons</u> to a larger tholon. It is our ability to transfer <u>coherent</u> <u>energy</u>, with technology and with thought, that makes us part of the <u>energy</u> distribution system of that larger system, but more than that, we are that part of this larger systems because of the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> in that larger system has evolved to the point where it needs to produce <u>coherent</u> distribution of <u>energy</u>, and as <u>energy</u> is <u>Awareness</u> and Intentions, that translates to “the intentional directing of <u>consciousness</u>”.

## <u>Structured</u> Water

Given how water seems to be such a good <u>tholonic</u> medium, can we add <u>structure</u> to water in a way that matches and/or enhances the <u>patterns</u> of the thologram and see some differences in how it <u>transmits</u> or interacts with <u>energy</u>? If we do see any differences, then we have another piece of <u>potential</u> evidence that supports the <u>tholonic</u> model.

As it happens, there is such a thing as *<u>structured</u> water*.  *<u>Coherent</u>* or *<u>Structured</u>* water, for those who are not familiar with the term, is regular water that has been modified to give it more <u>structure</u> or <u>pattern</u>, specifically in the way that the water <u>molecules</u> are arranged in relation to one another, or so it is claimed.

OK, I know I probably lost some of the readers with this last sentence.  If you do an Internet search of “<u>structured</u> water” one of the first results you will get is the Wikipedia entry that begins with “<u>structured</u> water is a term used in a marketing scam” and although that is true to the extent that anything can be a scam in the hands of scammers, the entry says nothing whatsoever on the research and testing that has been done regarding the use of <u>structured</u> water.

To the dogmatically skeptical, anything that challenges the current world view is “swarming with worms of heretical perversity”. It doesn’t matter if a new idea, in this case, <u>structured</u> water, has vast amounts of scientific research and support from highly accredited professionals and ample evidence one can find by researching the pioneers and leaders in the <u>field</u>, many with a lifetime of <u>contributions</u> and dozens of Chairs, Fellows, and Adjuncts with Accolades of their <u>life</u>’s <u>work</u>[^78], as well as hundreds of papers and dozens of books related to and supporting the <u>structured</u> water phenomena.  Skepticism has its place and serves a critical purpose, but regarding the extreme skepticism of <u>structured</u> water, that purpose does not seem to be moving <u>understanding</u> forward or seeking new solutions to real-world problems, such as solving global water shortage problems and increasing crop production, as has been well documented by some of Australia’s largest produce farms.

To see the result of my own tests and how to make <u>structured</u> water, see *Appendix J: <u>Structured</u> Water*.

There is quite a lot of good research on the subject that we won’t detail here, but if you want to learn more a good place to start is Fabian Ptok’s Masters theses *“Alternative Irrigation Methods: <u>Structured</u> Water in the context of a Growing Global Food Crisis due to Water Shortages”*[^79], which covers the subject well from an agricultural and security perspective but also has a <u>number</u> of references to the researchers and <u>work</u> going on in this area.  One of the often cited studies showed dramatic results in decreasing blood and <u>DNA</u> damage in diabetic rats, but this study is also criticized as it was small[^303] . There is also a book by Professor Gerald Pollack, who has an impressive list of credentials[^304], and is available online for free[^80] (which I have not read, so this is not an endorsement or recommendation).  Another good source is the <u>work</u> of Marcel Vogel (more on him later) who claimed that through years of <u>work</u> and thousands of experiments he was able to prove that various forms of <u>energy</u>, including thought, could permanently change the spectrographic properties of water, [^301] and that water was an <u>information</u> storage system.  This last claim is especially significant considering Vogel was not only a chemical and <u>physics</u> researcher at IBM for 27 years, but he was an <u>information</u> medium specialist, holding patents of hard-drive <u>memory</u> technologies that are in use to this day.

<img src="../Images/116-water-ice.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>Water is a particularly good test medium because the structure of molecular water is tetrahedral, and being the most basic shape of creation lends itself to many different tholonic applications.  It’s worth noting that when it was originally suggested that water might be tetrahedral in shape back in 1938 the idea was met with disbelief.  It was not until 80 years later, in 2013, that this was finally accepted as valid.  Today “it is widely accepted that liquid water structure is comprised of two closely interweaved components; i.e.  tetrahedral and hexagonal structures”.[^81]In fact, water, as ice, may be the closest instance of the entire tholonic structure of any other substance (that is common to us). *(Left image from “Tetrahedrality is key to the uniqueness of water”[^82])*

The *silicate <u>structures</u>* of minerals are also quiet similar in that they are made up of tetrahedrons of various arrangements.  In fact, the <u>structure</u> of water and quartz is so close that in some conditions ice has the same (or really similar) <u>structure</u> as quartz! [^302]This lends some credence to the metaphysical idea that water and quartz have a special relationship.

Radical <u>ideas</u> are often met with radical resistance.  <u>Structured</u> water is one of those <u>ideas</u>, and it falls into the same New Age category as “<u>crystal</u> power”.   Ignoring the 249D <u>crystal</u> that (possibly) created <u>reality</u>, common <u>crystals</u> do have some pretty impressive qualities.  

- Generate <u>electricity</u> (piezoelectric).

- Amplify, <u>transmit</u>, and store <u>data</u> (up to 300 million years [^342]).

- Generate signals (used in microchips, watches, internet routers and network controllers, satellites, up to billions of <u>cycles</u> per seconds).

- Control the transmission and phase of of light (liquid <u>crystal</u> displays - LCDs, )

- Ability to alter time (yes! they are called *time <u>crystals</u>*, and they represent a new state of matter, according to MIT.[^343]

- Ability to hold a <u>magnetic</u> charge.

The <u>reason</u> <u>crystals</u> can do all these amazing things is because of the <u>structure</u> of the elements that make a <u>crystal</u>, and water, with its tetrahedral <u>structure</u>, is like a form of liquid crystal.  As we have stated, <u>energy</u> creates <u>order</u>, and <u>movement</u> is the effect of <u>energy</u>, therefore, adding <u>energy</u> via <u>movement</u> to a tetrahedral liquid, such as water, will  have some positive or reinforcing effect on its <u>structure</u>, and that <u>structure</u>, being a more efficient conduit for transferring <u>energy</u>, will likewise have an effect on that which interacts with it by transferring more energy.I believe 


The hypothesis is then, simply by causing <u>movement</u> to commercial water (tap or bottled) we should see measurable effects.

In Ptok’s Master’s thesis mentioned above, the author examines various tests that grew different plants using tap water and <u>structured</u> water.

<center><img src='../Images/095-ptolks-images.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One of his findings was that using <u>structured</u> water increased alfalfa growth by 15.1%.  This may not sound like much, but in the U.S. alone a 15% increase in alfalfa growth represents an additional 20,700,000 tons of alfalfa, which has a value of over 4 billion dollars.

Similarly, some of Australia’s largest produce farms have reported needing 25% less water to produce a superior product than with traditional water.  This is a perfect example of how the simple enhancement of <u>order</u> at the most fundamental level can have radical changes up the chain.  These dramatic results were achieved with only one change to one element in one application.

In the <u>tholonic</u> model, this example also applies to <u>ideas</u>, <u>concepts</u>, and intelligence;  small changes in one area can have radical consequences in the world of <u>ideas</u>, and of course, ideologies.

**Review of studies**

There have been a <u>number</u> of studies of SW using animals.  One review does a meta-analysis of these studies, “<u>Structured</u> Water: effects on animals”. [^322]

> This review focuses on the effects of <u>structured</u> water on animals when it is consumed on a daily basis. <u>Structured</u> water is liquid water that is given altered H-bonding <u>structure</u> by treatment with various forms of <u>energy</u> including <u>magnetic</u> <u>fields</u> and light. While most of the research has been conducted on <u>magnetized</u>‘ water, which has <u>structure</u> of short duration, recent research has examined effects of a <u>structured</u> water with stability of at least 3.5 months.

**Conclusion**:

> <u>Magnetic</u> <u>field</u> strengths used to treat water vary from 500 G to 32,400 G, with duration of treatment ranging from seconds (magnetic flow-through systems using several high <u>field</u> strength <u>magnets</u>) to 72 hours using small volumes with static, low <u>field</u> strength magnets. Inadequate water treatment results in no or minimal biological effect, whereas excessive treatment may be associated with adverse effects (see below). Based on the results of the studies presented below, a <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u> strength of 1000 to 3000 G is required to generate water capable of exerting beneficial effects, while waters treated with <u>field</u> strengths greater than 5000 G may result in detrimental effects. Future studies need to provide detailed methodology and some key physico-chemical properties that are changed by the structuring process, and the duration of structural stability. Future research needs to determine the water treatment conditions that optimize for specific biological outcomes and the researchers must measure and report several key indicators that demonstrate water structuring. The latter, in particularly, would be most helpful in performing comparison between studies. **The animal research conducted to date consistently demonstrated beneficial effects of SW consumption**. Additional research is needed to demonstrate how these effects occur, and if these types of <u>structured</u> waters are safe to consume and use over the long term.

<img src='../Images/bullied_plant.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>There is another conclusion that also needs to be looked at, and that is not just the inability for some people to accept such findings, but their need to attack the findings.  An example of this is the very simple “experiment” for children at the IKEA store in the U.A.E. where they placed two identical plants side by side for 30 days.   The short YouTube video had 1,2 million view, with 6,700 likes and 625 dislikes, and many of teh comments were as vile as YouTube will allow.  Granted, this this exhibitions will never get publisher in the *Journal for Experimental Science*, but it is certainly sufficient to raise the question “Do emotions effect the life?”, which sounds like a ridiculously silly question, as we all know the answer to that, but while there are countless studies on the effect of plants on human emotions, there is nary a one (that I can find) on the effects of human emotions on plants.  This is unfortunate, as such a study would tell us a lot about the emotions/biology connection that is much harder to discover among the emotionally chaotic fear-driven culturally distorted minds of humans.  Unfortunately, the anger and dismissive attitudes expressed in the comments of this video are shared by leaders in the scientific community, which can at times be more of a cult of scientism.

Here is a very short list of books and papers that delve into experiments and perspectives that explore <u>awareness</u> and <u>reality</u> and are compatible with <u>tholonic</u> claims:

## Qualitative <u>Energy</u>

One experiment to consider is the <u>concept</u> of *qualitative <u>energy</u>*.  We have countless ways to test the quantitative properties of <u>energy</u>, but if we are claiming that quantitative and qualitative properties are related in some way, then can property effect the other, for example, via <u>induction</u>?  

Measuring the value of <u>money</u> is quantitative, so a \$10 bill is always \$10 regardless if it came from a blood diamonds or a farmer, but many people would reject that \$10 if they knew where it was from blood diamonds &hellip;a qualitative value that had significant quantitative effects as it has shifted over $1,000,000,000 away from the blood diamond industry.  Does that make the value of the <u>money</u> qualitative?  Subjectively, perhaps, but not objectively because all legal tender is centrally controlled by the State in a manner that removes all qualitative value.  In addition, the State has made it illegal for create a new forms of money.  But this is not the case in the cryptocurrency world.  There are currencies whose value is hugely influenced by service they provide, such as cryptocurrencies specifically bound to agriculture (SOYA, CORA, WHEA), precious metals (XAUT, DGX, GLC, PMGT, LKNS), marijuana (POT, CANN, DOPE), and even pornography (PORNCOIN).  There are coins based on political and ideological goals, such as privacy (XRP), candidates (FJB, LGB), <u>religions</u> (BBP, CT).  There are more that 19,000 cryptocurrencies at teh time of this writing, each with their own underlying philosophy, vision, goals, and values. These new infant currencies demonstrate the bond between quantitative and qualitative values, and how each of these two qualities can induce changes in the other.

By the same token (pub intended), and because <u>money</u> is a abstract representation of <u>energy</u>, we can extend this idea to <u>energy</u> in general and ask “can qualitative attributes effect quantitative measure, or visa versa?”, “Is there such a thing as qualitative <u>induction</u>?”

For example, a simple test could be performed with two vases of identical water. One vase can be subjected to constructive emotions, sounds, etc, while the others are subjected to destructive emotions, sounds etc.  This water is then used to water two identical plants.  Any difference in the plant’s growth night be attributable to the “quality” of the water.  

Why not simply expose the plants to such emotions?  Because the use of the <u>tholonically</u> compatible substance of water as a storage medium is the real test.  How, or if, the water effects plants is really the testing of the idea.  The question of whether plants are sensitive to any non-physical or non-electromagnetic stimulus remains, but we can look to the existing theories and tests to find that answer.  One such experiment is “The Florence Experiment” where bean plants accompanied a human as they slid down a 20 meter slide installed in the *Palazzo Strozzi* Renaissance palace of art in Florence, Italy.   This exhibit was put together by plant neurobiologist Professor Stefano Mancuso, founder of the study of plant neurobiology that studies the <u>intelligence</u> of plants, and German artist and former entomology researcher with a Ph.D. in Phytopathology, Carsten Höllerm.  

The idea was to see how plants responded to the emotions of “fun” and “exciting”.  This experiment was followed with another experiment where plants were exposed to people watching horror films.  The result of the experiment are [JWFIX: RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS INSERTED HERE] 

[THIS SECTIONS  ONLY APPLIES IF THE TEST RESULTS ARE AFFIRMATIVE]

This is not surprising to us, as plants, being the very bridge between the source of <u>energy</u> for this <u>planet</u> (Sun) and <u>life</u> on this <u>planet</u>, must be of a very high <u>order</u> of <u>intelligence</u>, as least according to the <u>tholonic</u> definition of <u>intelligence</u> of “The ability to maintain a <u>sustainable</u> <u>pattern</u> of <u>energy</u> within the <u>scope</u> of its existence.” and the <u>tholonic</u> claim that “<u>Intelligence</u> exists in anything that has a <u>sustainable</u> <u>pattern</u> of energy.”, because plants are not only far more <u>sustainable</u> than all other forms of <u>life</u>, no other form of <u>life</u> is <u>sustainable</u> without them. 

But even the traditional definition of <u>intelligence</u> of “The ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or *trying* situations.” applies because the creation of <u>life</u> on a dead <u>planet</u> is about as *trying* as it gets.  We can take it further with the traditional definition of <u>intelligence</u> of “The ability to learn, understand, and make judgments or have opinions that are based on reason.” if we presume the <u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u> that instantiated in plant <u>life</u> has the ability to learn, understand, make judgments, <u>reason</u> and even have opinions.  Now, apply the <u>tholonic</u> definition of “<u>understanding</u>”, i.e., “the <u>knowledge</u> of something sufficient enough to be able to make verifiably accurate <u>statements regarding said</u> thing”, and we can also claim that a <u>tholon</u> has <u>knowledge</u>, as every form of <u>life</u> is accurately described by the <u>knowledge</u> data-storage medium of RNA/DNA (which may have existed long before <u>life</u> itself).

The <u>tholonic</u> definition of <u>intelligence</u> is slightly different, “The ability to maintain a <u>sustainable</u> <u>pattern</u> of <u>energy</u> within the <u>scope</u> of its existence.”, which implicitly includes the traditional definitions, and where “<u>reason</u>” extends beyond current human reasoning.  As <u>patterns</u> come from <u>order</u>, which is the result of <u>energy</u>, and <u>energy</u> is <u>awareness</u>, then, by this reasoning, <u>intelligence</u> is synonymous with “ordered or <u>structured</u> awareness.”

Mancuso claim that plants *are* intelligent is quite compatible with the <u>tholonic</u> model, as is even Charles Darwin’s, albeit contextually limited by the world-view of the 1870s .

> “it’s hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle (the first part of a <u>seedling</u> to emerge from the <u>seed</u> during the process of germination) thus endowed, and having the power of directing movements of the adjoining parts, acts like a <u>brain</u> of one of the lower animals.”  **~Charles Darwin, “The Power of <u>Movement</u> in Plants” (1880)**

What is surprising is that out current world-view continues to be based on the erroneous <u>concepts</u> passed down by the likes of <u>Aristotle</u>, who wrote in “De Anima”, that plants have a “low level”, “vegetative <u>soul</u>” because they are incapable of local <u>movement</u> and ability to sense.  Like his claims about <u>gravity</u>, both statements are observably wrong , even to the ancient Greeks, had he bothered to actually investigate.

## Plants as “familiars”

## <u>Language</u> and <u>Metaphysics</u>

It is well known that <u>language</u> has the power to hold a social <u>order</u> together, or to destroy it.  <u>Language</u> has such power because the <u>order</u> and <u>hierarchy</u> of <u>concepts</u> that form a social <u>order</u> are known, taught and defined by words.  In addition, words and <u>language</u> actually form neurological pathways in our <u>brain</u>, and these pathways exert physiological pressure in the physical <u>structure</u> of the <u>language</u> processing part of the brain.  The brilliant linguist Noam Chomsky, in his *Generative-transformational Theory* of <u>language</u>, states that children are born with the hard-wired <u>understanding</u> of <u>language</u>, and the only thing they need to learn is the context of how that innate <u>understanding</u> is <u>culturally</u> expressed.  

> Anecdotal to this, my son was never taught to read or write, raised in a house without TV, radio, or internet, and in a rural environment.  He was exposed to a Rudolf Steiner-esq form of learning where he was not “taught”, but rather “exposed”, allowing his innate <u>knowledge</u> to manifest at its natural pace.  When he entered public school at the age of 8 or 9,  his reading and writing abilities far exceeded those of his classmates. 

It must be stated that while the first casualty of war may be <u>truth</u>, the first act of war is an attack on <u>language</u> and words, which begins long before the shooting starts.  One example of such a salvo aimed as Western <u>Culture</u> is the post-modern <u>concept</u> of <u>language</u> and the redefining of words.  This very successful neo-Marxist offensive began in the 1960s and has been so successful that by 2022 even a U.S, Supreme Court Justice was unable to define the word “woman”, and this view was staunchly supported by the largest publishing company in the U.S., who unironically reported “[her] answer was scientifically sound. There is no sufficient way to clearly define what makes someone a woman.”[^358]

Words and <u>language</u> are fundamental to psychology, communications, behavior, <u>culture</u>, cognition, relationships, perception, identity, <u>politics</u>, and just about all aspects of a society.  Consequently, it’s challenging to describe <u>ideas</u> that use <u>concepts</u> that are outside our vernacular.  The only solution is to define new <u>concepts</u> and create new words for them. Last year, 20 new words were added to the dictionary including “ecoanxiety” , “Dunning-Kruger”, “hodophobia” (fear of traveling), “nothingburger”, “ratio” (as in “dude, you got ratio-ed”; likes/dislikes of a social media post).  The words we create, and how we use words in general, might be a good indicator as to where <u>society</u> is headed.  At least that is the <u>concept</u> behind the study of “predictive linguistics”.  The problem with predictive linguistics, and words/language in general, is that each person’s different experience with words invokes a different qualitative context[^357], so, even if everyone agrees on what the word “walk” means, it does not mean that word will invoke the same subjective context, and the context will determine the psychological, emotional, typically unconscious or “right <u>brain</u>” meaning of that word.  All of us have experienced this, usually with scents, places, or things, but it applies to words/language as well.

Scientific or technical words are the easiest to create because they can be clearly and definitively described.  Words to convey emotions or beliefs are harder as they are subjective, but as we all have feelings and beliefs, we can all generally agree on words like “<u>love</u>”, “<u>fear</u>”, “<u>spirit</u>”, “freedom”, but the specifics of these words will never be agreed upon.  It’s even harder to defined new words for existential or esoteric <u>concepts</u>, such as “<u>awareness</u>”, “<u>consciousness</u>”, “<u>soul</u>”, “god”, or the metaphysical aspects of <u>concepts</u> like “<u>intention</u>”, “free-will”, “being”.  The most challenging <u>concepts</u> to describe are those that are technical, emotional, and metaphysical, such as the <u>concept</u> of energy. <u>Energy</u> is everything that is, can be, and will ever be, and by everything, I mean *everything*, which includes <u>consciousness</u> and <u>awareness</u>, intentions, cause and effect, <u>space-time</u>, <u>spirit</u>, <u>soul</u>, free-will, and literally anything else you, or anyone who ever did, is, or will live, can imagine.

In <u>order</u> to describe such things we can invent new words, but unless you are a <u>cultural</u> icon, world leader, or brilliant scientist who has the support of the media, your new words will remain a mystery.   Many new words are serendipitous, as they were accidentally created , such as the word “malapropism” (nonsensical, often humorous utterance), which is an <u>adaptation</u> of the name of a character, Mrs. Malaprop, from the 1775 play “The Rivals”.  Even the word “serendipity” itself was invented by writer and politician Horace Walpole in 1754 as an allusion to *Serendip*, an old name for Sri Lanka.  “Banana Republic”, “catch-22”, “bedazzled”, “beatnik”, “cyberspace”, are all invented words that found a home in the <u>collective</u> <u>consciousness</u> of our <u>culture</u> because we could all recognize and agree on their meaning and agree that it filled a need.  To create a new word that describes a state of <u>understanding</u>, we can look to Robert Heinlein, who had to write an entire book (“Stranger in a Strange Land”, 1961) to describe the nuanced definition of the word “grok”, and even then, the definition has been drastically reduced to a simple sentence; “To understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with; also, to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment".

Short of inventing new words, we can use existing words as representative, symbolic, metaphorical allusions to describe metaphysical, supernatural, or existential concepts.  Some languages are better suited for this, so we can appropriate their words into our vernacular, such as “chi”, “chakras”,“<u>Tao</u>”, gestalt”, “karma”, “mantra”, “yoga”, “prana”.

How, then, can we talk about such broad and illusive <u>concepts</u> as SAI in a way that can be understood by all? The best we can do is use the simplest words possible, leaving less room for wildly differing interpretations.   At the most fundamental level, SAIs can be described as “<u>I Am</u>” and “ I Will”.  It doesn’t get more basic that that. 

In the thologram, we have the <u>concept</u> of a 0-dimensional point which only has two attributes, SAI, however, the <u>singularity</u> of that point can only be described as “I”. This is the first <u>duality</u> of *<u>somethingness</u>* and *<u>nothingness</u>*, that of “I” and “Not I”.

The 1<sup>st</sup> creation of “I” is “Am”, which was created by the 1<sup>st</sup> <u>movement</u> of “I”, making “Am” the first verb of “to be”. This is the 1<sup>st</sup> instance of *<u>Awareness</u>*, “<u>I Am</u>”, and is represented by the first creation of the green dot of *Definition/Limitation*.  This <u>movement</u> also created another instance, that of “Will”, as the <u>movement</u>, whatever it was, was an act of volition, as nothing moves unless <u>force</u> is applied to it (the <u>nature</u> of this <u>movement</u> and volition is another topic altogether).  This “Will” is represented by the red dot, that of *Contribution/integration*, and is the 1<sup>st</sup> instance of *<u>Intention</u>*.  It is the *<u>force</u>* of  *<u>intention</u>* that caused the primal <u>movement</u>, and it is the *<u>intention</u>* of that primal <u>movement</u> to return to a <u>balanced</u> state, just as it is <u>force</u> that causes <u>energy</u> to move, and it is the *<u>intention</u>* of <u>energy</u> to always return to balance.

We now have 3 <u>concepts</u> that describe the creation of the first trigram; “I”, “<u>I Am</u>”,  and “I Will”.  This should sound familiar as we briefly touched ion the same theme in Chapter 7, *<u>Structure</u>*.  This association between the thologram and ancient spiritual <u>knowledge</u> was never intended, but it was inevitable as both paths are based on the same <u>laws</u> of existence.

Prior to introducing the <u>concept</u> of the thologram we touched on the linguistic implications of the ancient name of the Abrahamic god being “<u>I Am</u> **That** <u>I Am</u>” in chapter 7,  “*<u>Structure</u>*”,  and demonstrated how that phrase refers to that which is both a *finished* an *unfinished* state of being, or, *that which is*, *that which could be,* and *that which will be*.  Here, we look deeper into our ancestor’s attempts to describe the emerging <u>concept</u> of “The Creator”.

<img src='../Images/iam-grid.png' style='float:right;width:18%'/>Immediately we are challenged with the obfuscation of language. The verb “I Am” (<img src='../Images/iam.png' style='height:10px'/>) in ancient Hebrew can also mean “I Will”, as there was no *past* or *future* tense in those days (as present tense was implicit), only *finished* and *unfinished* tense (*perfect* and *imperfect* forms) , so the act of being *what is* and being *what one wills to be*, or *what could be*, are one in the same as far as past and future goes, but has two states, one that is *finished*, and one that is *unfinished*, or *that which is* (awareness) and *that which will be* (intention).  Even more confounding is that there was no verb for the present tense of “being”.  To communicate the message “I am a man” one would say “I man”.  I assume the this is because the “am” part is explicit by the obvious fact that the speaker exists.  So, “I Am” would be something like “I who I”, or just “I I”, which is pronounced “*Ina ina*“  or “*ana ana*”, or maybe just “*Na na*” as the Aleph (&aleph;) in Hebrew is a consonant, not a vowel.  The form of “*Ina Ina*” is a mantra used by some Christians to this day. There was also blurring of the difference between the seemingly innocent words of “that”, “what” and “who”, as all three concepts were represented as a single word (<img src='../Images/who.png' style='height:10px'/>), and it was the context that was deterministic. Consequently, there are at least 28 different ways to interpret what God said to Moses (see table), not including the most based interpretation of “I I”. This is further obfuscated by the fact that Moses could not go to his people and say “I Am That I Am, and I have come to save you”.  Not only would that sound a bit over the top and highly suspicious, it was probably the case, as pointed out by Jaynes[^31], that human consciousness at that time could only perceive god as someone/something outside of themselves.  So, it’s only reasonable that the voice of god would have to tell Moses that he should tell his people that he was sent not by “I Am That I Am” (<img src='../Images/iam.png' style='height:10px'/>), but by “He Will Be”(<img src='../Images/yhvh.png' style='height:10px'/>), but, as that word is made of 3 verbs, it could also means “He was” (*perfect*), “He (is)” (implied *present*), “He will be” (*imperfect*). It is from this word we get the name Jehovah, figuratively meaning “He Is God”.  

<center><img src='../Images/ancient-yhvh_2.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

Now we have 56 names for god; 28 in the 1<sup>st</sup> person, and another 28 names in the 3<sup>rd</sup> person, but no matter how you translate any of these names, god is always in the 3<sup>rd</sup> person.  This is a <u>concept</u> that keeps the Abrahamic <u>religions</u> (and many others as well) <u>sustainable</u>, so it is not only valid, but “true”, at least as long as such beliefs are sustained.

Why are we getting into this linguistic linguine?  To show how painfully convoluted we have managed to scramble the simplest concepts that exist, that of “I Am” and “I Will”.  After thousands of years and thousands of volumes of opinion, doctrine, religious law, and in spite of the deliberate hiding/misspelling/encrypting/misinterpreting of the name of god (as it was forbidden to be spoken) there is still heated debate as to the “real” and/or “secret” significance of these words.  And if this subject wasn’t already shrouded in the mystical symbolism of Moses’ isolated vision, it has been translated from Phoenician to Hebrew to Greek to English and dozens of other languages, none of which hold the same significance as the language of Moses. Historians say that the Phoenician alphabet evolved out of symbols for things like fish (<img src='../Images/p_fish.png' style='height:10px'/>), eye (<img src='../Images/p_eye.png' style='height:10px'/>), tooth (<img src='../Images/p_tooth.png' style='height:10px'/>), weapon (<img src='../Images/p_weapon.png' style='height:10px'/>), etc., and even though the symbols and order are similar to Hebrew (and Greek), the legend is that Hebrew came from the words that were written with black fire on white fire in the presence of god, and that these words are the Torah as well as all the names of god.  

Obviously, the significance of letters, words, and sentences will be dramatically different even between these similar languages.  While any belief that advances dogma and confusion of any kind is a belief that is detrimental in understating the <u>nature</u> of <u>reality</u>, but such beliefs have existed for thousands of years and appear to be very sustainable.  In light of their success, let’s offer a simple description of the <u>tholonic</u> <u>concept</u> that is linguistically and <u>conceptually</u> compatible with many belief systems and which may shed light on their cryptic symbolism. 

## What? That!

You enter a restaurant and the waiter asks you “**What** would you like?”, and you reply “I’ll take **that**.” pointing to a plate of Rocky Mountain Oysters.  “What” is defining the context and is synonymous with “anything that” (with the implied “is on the menu”).  When “what” is used as a *predeterminer*, such as “What a great idea!”, it is still referring to the larger <u>concept</u> of “great idea” and is stating that the specific idea is worthy of being a member of the “great idea” category.  Any use of “what” will always refer to some context, either explicitly or implicitly; Bob: “I have <u>money</u> for the meter, so we can park here.”, Carol: “I have six toes.”,  Bob: “What!?”.

The word “that” is, grammatically, a *determiner* and a *relative pronoun* because it always refers to something specific that is contextually relative, and implies a plurality of <u>potential</u> “that’s”.  There’s no need for the waiter to ask **what** you want, or for you to say “I’ll have **that**”, if the only thing **that** they serve is Rocky Mountain Oysters.  

“<u>I Am</u> That <u>I Am</u>” is stating that the <u>existence</u> of “<u>I Am</u>” is, and only is, <u>awareness</u> of “I”, and that the entirely of that <u>awareness</u> is, and only is, the <u>singularity</u> of **that** awareness.  There is no context for **that** which is “<u>I Am</u>” other than “<u>I Am</u>”.  It is perfectly self-referential as “<u>I Am</u>” consists of only of **that** <u>singularity</u> **that** is “<u>I Am</u>”.  On other hand, “<u>I Am</u> **What** <u>I Am</u>” means that the entirety of “<u>I Am</u>” is the sum of its parts, and even if those parts are instances of “<u>I Am</u>”, it is not a <u>singularity</u> because “what” explicitly refers to a plurality in contrast to the <u>singularity</u> of “that”. 

<img src='../Images/popeye.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>Tholonically, “I Am **That** I Am” describes the source of creation, and therefore the thologram as a whole,  and “I Am **What** I Am” describes all the child tholons (and *Popeye the Sailorman’s* world view.  For those who might not know, Popeye was fond of saying “I yam what I yam, and that's all what I yam”).  If you were asked “**What** shape (in the above below) is identical to the outline of all the shapes?” you would point to the first shape and say “**That** one”, but if I asked “Hand me the triangle shaped one”, you’d probably ask “**What** version would you like?”  All the forms can be said to be that of trigrams, but there is only one case where the whole and the part, the context and the content, are identical, and that is the first instance where the **part** equals the whole rather than the **parts** equaling the whole.

<center><img src='../Images/trizirp.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

Descartes has a similar <u>understanding</u> is this <u>concept</u> when he coined “Cognito, ergo sum” (*I think, therefore <u>I am</u>*)[^359].  Unfortunately, qualifying “<u>I Am</u>” with “I Think” could easily be perceived as intellectual hubris, or worse, self-defeating and dangerously ignorant.  While Descartes was a brilliant mathematician, scientist, philosopher and even metaphysician, we have to understand his world view in the context of 17<sup>th</sup> century Europe, before Newton, and even before the *Age of Enlightenment*, as many historian consider the *Age of Enlightenment* to have begun when Descartes originally coined this phrase with his publication of “Discourse on Method”.  The Western <u>concepts</u> of mind, <u>consciousness</u>, and thought were only beginning to hatch and they would quickly grow to be recognized as the defining quality that not only separated man from beast and made man a divine creature.  We can’t just blame intellectual arrogance that the intelligentsia of the day saw themselves closer to, and favored by, their all-powerful <u>Christian</u> sky-god, as this pitfall comes packaged with the ability to say “I” in the first place, but it no doubt played a role in their world view of those who ushered in the Age of Enlightenment.  The ability to have the <u>concept</u> of “<u>I Am</u>” was only possible for those that possessed  <u>consciousness</u> and rationality, as least in the way these <u>concepts</u> were defined later by Freud.  According to Freud, <u>consciousness</u> and rationality are not only ego-centric, but the are the source of the ego.  

Being the pioneer that Freud was, we should view his theories as “first drafts” of psychological theory, especially in light of the <u>cultural</u> revolution fueled by madness and modernity in 1900 Vienna.  The <u>seeds</u> of this revolution were being sewn 50 years earlier in Leipzig, Germany, when Gustav Fechner’s theories created what would later become *physiological <u>science</u>*, and 1879, when William Wundt founded the first laboratory for psychological research, also in Leipzig, and which was succeeded the empirical psychology of Ferdinand Ueberwasse.  It was this intellectual garden of the rigid, disciplined, demanding, competitive, imperialist German <u>culture</u> that was being strictly enforced the some-what tyrannical “Iron Chancellor”, Otto von Bismarck, that nourished the theories of Freud, <u>Jung</u>, Adler, Titchener, and the other midwives of modern psychology that quickly spread throughout the western world.  It was this view of humanity that is responsible for the modern <u>concept</u> of “self” as an immutable state as well as producing sociopaths such as B. F. Skinner and Ivan Pavlov.  The <u>tholonic</u> view is that “self”, like all <u>tholons</u>, is always in a state of growth, change, adaptation.  There is no “self”, there are only instances of “self” that are contextually relevant.  The <u>energy</u> that launches rockets and the <u>energy</u> that moves your arms is the same, only in different convex, just as a small bubble contains the same air as a large bubble.  The <u>reality</u> of the bubble or <u>energy</u> is defined exclusively by the properties and <u>scope</u> of it instantiation.  Remove that context and there is only air or SAI.  As the context changes, so too does the “self”.  The <u>concept</u> of “self-awareness” is not only an illusion, but a deception, as it reinforces the <u>concept</u> of an isolated, separate, individual spiritual identity.  This is similar to the deceptive <u>concept</u> of “social justice”, as there is only justice, social or otherwise, or the Orwellian idea that peace can be attained though war, and is a major factor in the growth of a malignant form of *Individual Identitarianism*.  <u>Tholonically</u>, “self-awareness” is a divisive illusion, while “<u>awareness</u>” alone is a fundamental truth.  Nevertheless, the <u>concept</u> of “self” is quite powerful in the realm of modern culture.

While it is unreasonable to suggest that the conscious and rational thinking is ego-centric, it is not unreasonable to see how one must have an have the <u>concept</u> of “I” before they can say “I Think”, and, having such a <u>concept</u>, it would be natural for god-fearing <u>Christians</u> to consider themselves “special” and “better” in the eyes of their rather demanding, judging and punishing god compared to plants and animals.  While <u>consciousness</u> and rationality are not ego-centric, that does not means that conscious, rational <u>humans</u> are not egotistical and self-serving any more than the benefits of <u>fire</u> does not mean it won’t do a lot of damage if uncontrolled.  This ailment of the human condition, the belief that man was not just “better” than all else, but was destined to control all else, was also supported by the very word of god, as the bible clearly states, in no uncertain terms, that man is *commanded* to subdue and dominate all that lives (“Subdue” in Hebrew is “kavesh”, which means ”A stool upon which to put one’s feet; to <u>force</u> into submission; to put and end to”.  The modern word “kabash”, as in “Put the kabash on it”, meaning to end it, comes for the word “kavesh”) :

> “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the <u>earth</u> and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the <u>earth</u> and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” **~Genesis 1.26**

It’s not surprising then, that for a devout 17<sup>th</sup> century <u>Christian</u>, which includes most, if not all, the great minds of Western modern <u>culture</u>, the <u>concept</u> of “I think” and “<u>I Am</u>” were essentially synonymous.  That which did not have the <u>concept</u> of “I” was no more useful than how it was judged to be useful by man.  “I think therefore <u>I am</u>” was the same as “<u>I am</u>, therefore <u>I am</u>”, which (if you have not seen it already) is the same as “<u>I Am</u> That <u>I Am</u>”.  The difference is, Moses was hearing the voice of god, and Descartes was using reason.  One migth wonder, was the the voice of god, as heard by Moses, and the tagline for the *Age of Enlightenment*, the same <u>concept</u> perceived in two different contexts?  <u>Tholonically</u>, yes, but that begs the question: is <u>reason</u> the modern day voice of god, or was the ancient voice of god an early instance of <u>reason</u>?  

While the thologram has no <u>concept</u> of a divine creator (beyond that of a 0-dimensional dot in an infinite <u>nothingness</u>, it does have a <u>concept</u> of a <u>hierarchy</u> of intelligences that have <u>awareness</u> and intention. From the <u>tholonic</u> view, both epiphanies were due to the intentions of a greater <u>intelligence</u> to instantiate itself, but not simply *a* greater <u>intelligence</u>, but many greater intelligences that are constantly in a stage of <u>negotiation</u> via conflict and cooperation.

## Are <u>Archetypes</u> Alive?

If <u>ideas</u> are <u>archetypes</u> that have <u>energy</u> and <u>fields</u>, then it would be reasonable to think that an idea could be reinforced and strengthened by adding more <u>energy</u> to it.  How would one go about adding <u>energy</u> to an idea? If <u>awareness</u> is <u>energy</u>, then one obvious way would be to simply increase the <u>awareness</u> that an idea is exposed to.  This sort of thing is done all the time.  Take, for example, National Prayer Day in the U.S. (May 7th) when the President signs a proclamation encouraging all Americans to pray on this day and “turn to God”.

Now, imagine the <u>potential</u> power of 114,000,000 consciousnesses all being exposed to the same <u>symbolism</u> at the same time. This is exactly what happened during the broadcast of Super Bowl XLIX (2014), but unlike National Prayer Day where the participants voluntarily focused their <u>awareness</u> towards one idea, it was more like a National <u>Awareness</u> Harvesting Minute of the <u>awareness</u> of the 114,000,000 unwitting participants.  Unlike the barrage of commercials and propaganda we are subjected to on a daily basis, this particular event was unique. According to a very suspicious article[^169] that was written by a conveniently anonymous designer who claimed to have once worked in the graphics department of a huge media company, out of boredom and his opposition to the then administration of President Bush, he deliberately hid pyramid eyes, pentagrams, and symbols from John Dee, the infamous sixteenth century occultist to the Queen of England, into the intro and promo videos for everything from war events to major sports events, including Super Bowl XLIX. Ignoring the question of why the designer thought secret occult symbols were a good choice to subliminally oppose President Bush, it was not the claim that was suspicious, as with just a little investigation his claims can be confirmed, but that this published article, which appeared overnight on over 36,000 websites, conveniently provided a “plausible deniability” <u>defense</u> for the media companies when Internet sleuths were discovering these symbols. Regardless of the intentions of those responsible, the effect was that a tremendous amount of <u>awareness</u>, albeit unconscious <u>awareness</u>, was pumped into these images; images that have existing <u>archetypes</u>, and therefore, according to the <u>tholonic</u> model, their own <u>awareness</u>, <u>intention</u> and intelligence.

Considering the average American youth spends 900 hours a year in school, and another 1,200 hours a year watching television, and that 70% of the American adult waking <u>life</u> is spent in front of digital media, [^170] and that the average 78.6 year old American will spend nine years of his <u>life</u> watching TV, two years of which is just watching commercials, we're talking about a tremendous amount of <u>awareness</u> up for grabs. How is that currently being used?

The more pessimistic reader might begin to suspect that the manipulation of <u>awareness</u> as <u>energy</u> is perhaps already well understood by some less-than-noble folks. Others may think this is bordering on mystical conspiracy theories.  The reader will come to their own conclusions. Our <u>intention</u> is to question the effects of such <u>awareness</u> harvesting, especially in light of the <u>understanding</u> that <u>ideas</u> have a <u>life</u> of their own. This includes ancient <u>ideas</u>, even if they seem to have been forgotten by modern society.

We have the ability to tap into these archetypal realities whenever we like or need, and often do unconsciously. This is the purpose and power of myths, be they ancient or modern. As these <u>archetypes</u> originate in the uninstantiated <u>tholonic</u> state, they are free from the <u>limitations</u> of our <u>space-time</u> <u>reality</u>, and therefore they are eternal, or at least, long-lived. The myths and beliefs of the ancient past continue to live on in ever-evolving meaning and <u>symbolism</u> that promote their <u>existence</u>, almost like a self-mutating virus. This is the source of talismanic, totem or symbolic “magic” and the invoking of deities, intelligences, energies, be they “good guys” or “bad guys” (although it’s often hard to tell them apart).

Much of our everyday <u>culture</u> is inextricably bound to these <u>archetypes</u> and thereby further empowering them, usually without our knowledge. <u>Jung</u> described these <u>archetypes</u> as “ordering factors in the <u>collective</u> unconscious”. These are the twelve <u>archetypes</u> of the human psyche organized into four cardinal types, which we described earlier.

For example, the modern word “hell” comes from the ancient Norse goddess named *Hel* whose job it was to not only judge the dead but also help the apocalypse along by leading an army of the dead in a ship made of the fingernails of corpses.

The <u>concept</u> of Hell, or whatever it happens to be called, is deeply ingrained into the worldview of billions of people who have little <u>knowledge</u> of the roots of their beliefs. These believers, through the <u>energy</u> of their <u>awareness</u>, bring into creation associated and/or parasitic <u>archetypes</u> that are attached to primary <u>archetypes</u> which they are completely unaware of, but which are energized by that <u>awareness</u> nevertheless. While this can’t be proven, I suspect that the more people who believe in hell, the more empowered and manifest the <u>concept</u> of an apocalypse as these <u>concepts</u> are embodied together in at least one <u>tholon</u>, that of the goddess *Hel*.  The ironic part is that believing in the traditional <u>Christian</u> or Islamic heaven by default empowers their <u>concept</u> of a hell, as they are presented as two sides of one state; the afterlife.

Looking at the non-intuitive, humorous, and bizarre ways ancient and modern <u>concepts</u> have formed relationships will give just a hint of how intertwined <u>archetypes</u> can become.  For example, we can draw a very straight line of connection from the invention of hieroglyphics and moon worship to pharmaceutical drugs and those vacuum sealed plastic bags of imported Colombian coffee you buy at the supermarket, connecting along the way with magicians, pyramids, thieves and secret societies. The super-short version goes something like this: The Egyptian moon god, Thoth, who invented hieroglyphics, was adopted by the Greeks who called him Hermes, who was among other things, the protector of thieves. He carried the Caduceus, which became the symbol of modern <u>medicine</u>, and was the founder of the super-secret mystical teachings of Hermetism. So protected were these teachings that the word *hermetic* became synonymous with *perfectly sealed*, hence, *hermetically sealed* bags.  <u>Language</u>, as a way to convey <u>concepts</u>, is a microcosm of how <u>archetypes</u> merge, evolve, and reproduce. 

<center><img src='../Images/hermes.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

What we have referred to as an uninstantiated <u>tholon</u> can, at least in this context, be an <u>archetypes</u> as a form of *metameme*, which is a form of a *<u>meme</u>* that only exists in the <u>collective</u> unconscious and/or in the world of <u>archetypes</u>, the thologram. If a <u>meme</u> is “an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a <u>culture</u>”, then a metameme is an “an idea or belief formed within the <u>tholonic</u> <u>field</u> (i.e. universal mind,  <u>collective</u> unconscious, morphic <u>field</u>, etc.) and spreads from <u>tholonic</u> <u>field</u> to <u>tholonic</u> <u>field</u>”.   

You make have heard phrases like  “If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, its probably a duck.”, or “When you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras.”, or “The simplest explanation is most likely the right one”, otherwise known as *Occam’s Razor*. Applying the wisdom of this advice, what are we to make of the fact that research out of Princeton University supports the theory that <u>ideas</u>, in the form of social media networks, follow the same growth models as <u>viruses</u> (in the form of diseases)? [^171] Outside of the conclusion that perhaps Facebook is actually a viral <u>disease</u>, it tells us that <u>ideas</u> follow the same <u>patterns</u> as existing natural <u>patterns</u> of growth, suggesting we might learn more about the <u>life</u> of <u>archetypes</u> if we considered them living.  OK, <u>viruses</u> *may* not be “alive”, but I say *may* because some experts in the <u>field</u> are redefining “<u>life</u>” to include viruses. [^172],[^173] Regardless, the growth, survival and creation of <u>ideas</u> follow the same <u>patterns</u> as everything else that grows, survives and creates. For this <u>reason</u>, a clever researcher might be able to find correlations between the <u>life</u> <u>cycle</u> of a galaxy and something as seemingly unrelated as, say, the <u>life</u> <u>cycle</u> of a tomato plant. One such researcher might be Tokyo Institute of Technology’s Maruyama Shigenori, a leading geophysicist and founder of the Center for Bio-Earth <u>Planetology</u>, who, by connecting the theories of astronomy with those of the <u>life</u> sciences, has shown how entire <u>planets</u> may well be living super-organisms.

This idea that <u>archetypes</u> are alive, however, has a dark side to it because so many of our beliefs are manipulated and controlled by others whose agenda is less than altruistic, hidden, and who are aware of the mechanics of <u>reality</u> and consciousness. From the most powerful laser in the world named after the Hindu god of <u>destruction</u> to trivial tarot cards based on movie stars, we can find countless examples of how these imposed <u>archetypes</u> infiltrate our <u>understanding</u> of the world.

So, what kind of world are we creating with our <u>awareness</u>, desires, and beliefs, as a <u>planet</u>? To find out, I wrote a mobile phone app that allows people to send out into the <u>universe</u> either a blessing or a curse.  The app was (unsurprisingly) called “Bless or Curse”.

The majority of both blesses and curses are about…wait for it…love, <u>money</u>, and <u>health</u> (surprise!). Some were touching, such as the blessing of “May he win lotto,” cast upon the bus driver who “stopped just for me”. Some are bizarrely dark, such as the curse of “Torture Rape Murder die die die die die,” cast upon Noisy Walgreen Employees. The predominant *cursers*, were Iran, Southern Australia, Puerto Rico, Russia/North Korean border, western South Africa, and Honolulu.  Predominant *blessers* were northwest Canada, southwest U.S., Eastern Europe, South pacific, Uruguay, Ghana/Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and the jungles of Northern Brazil.

Humanity seems to be pretty well split down the middle between the *blessers* and the *cursers*, as you can see by this report map below. In general, it tended to hover over the 53% area, giving the *blessers* a slight edge over the *cursers*.

### Tulpas

One of the better legends of how <u>ideas</u> can take on a <u>life</u> of their own comes from the well-known 1932 book, *Magic And Mystery In Tibet*, by Belgian-French explorer Alexandra David-Néel.

In the Far East, there is the <u>concept</u> of a *tulpa*, which is a type of thought-form. They are understood to be a sentient <u>consciousness</u> that resides in the <u>brain</u> of the host and can have separate feelings, thoughts, and <u>memories</u> from the host and can communicate through thought, imagination, feelings, or verbally. With enough practice and concentration, the host can see the tulpa’s form in the real world, and for the truly advanced *tulpamancer*, can be seen by others as well. Of course, this is a preposterous idea to Western thinkers. 

Alexandra David-Neel was a woman of remarkable courage. She recounts how the only way she could enter the forbidden (to foreigners) city of Lhasa, Tibet, was to sneak in dressed as a beggar carrying only a compass, <u>money</u> (for ransom in case she was kidnapped), and a gun. She was also known for her sound scientific thinking and her opinions and observation carried weight in academic and scientific circles. Doctor A. D’Arsonval, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, The Academy of <u>Medicine</u>, professor at the College of France and president of the Institute of General Psychology, said of Alexandra David-Néel:

> This well-known and courageous explorer of Tibet unites in herself all the physical, moral and intellectual qualities that could be desired of one who is to observe and examine a subject of this kind.[^174]

So, when she described how she used the techniques taught to her by the Tibetan magicians to conjure up her own *tulpa*, it is not as easy to discard them as pure fantasy. In her case, she manifested a short, pudgy, jolly monk, as per her intentions.  Perhaps even more interesting was that this tulpa, once it began to be visible to others, began to have its own free will, a <u>life</u> of its own; the jolly, fat monk began to grow lean and taller, and less jolly. It eventually became a major problem for her, and she had to spend six months “dissolving” it. As she states:

> The fat, chubby-cheeked fellow grew leaner, his face assumed a vaguely mocking, sly, malignant look. He became more troublesome and bold. In brief, he escaped my control. I ought to have let the phenomenon follow its course, but the presence of that unwanted companion began to prove trying to my nerves; it turned into a ‘day-nightmare.’ Moreover, I was beginning to plan my journey to Lhasa and needed a quiet <u>brain</u> devoid of other preoccupations, so I decided to dissolve the phantom. I succeeded, but only after six months of hard struggle. My mind-creature was tenacious of life. There is nothing strange in the fact that I may have created my own hallucination. The interesting point is that in these cases of materialization, others see the thought-forms that have been created.

Whether tulpas exist or not is left to the reader. The point is that the belief that <u>ideas</u> can take on a <u>life</u> if their own is neither new nor unique.

On a related note, keep an eye on the research into what is essentially the <u>collective</u> <u>consciousness</u> of artificial <u>intelligence</u>, or *A.I. Swarms*, as they are called,[^175],[^176] and the early attempts to create artificial humans.[^177] <u>Science</u> and technology is attempting to create their own “tulpas”, and one day they may also prove to be “more troublesome and bold, escaping our control.”
