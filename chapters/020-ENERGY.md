# 2: ENERGY

###### Nothing exists without energy.  Everything exists within the laws of energy.

##### **Synopsis:** Nothing exists without energy as everything is an expression of energy.  This includes thought, archetypes, ideas, concepts, etc.  Energy creates patterns, which creates archetypes, which creates form.  Form and archetype are instances of the same expression in different contexts.  Our understanding of energy (and of all things) is limited by our abilities to perceive and understand.

##### **Keywords:** energy, archetypes, reality, material

The topic of energy will be reviewed many times further on, but at this stage it’s only important to point out two types of energy; *kinetic* energy, which is the energy capable of causing change to a system as a result of movement, such as water passing through a turbine in a dam, and *potential* energy, which is the energy that is not moving but is available, such as all the water in the dam that is not yet passing through the turbine.

Where the primal energy came from that created our universe is still, and will probably remain, unanswered, at least by modern science.  Science, mythology, and religion each have their own stories and theories, and, not surprisingly, many of these theories are not that conceptually far apart from each other.  One thing we can say about the energy that created this universe (if we are to believe the first law of thermodynamics that states energy cannot be destroyed or created) is that it existed before the Universe was created.

For our purpose, at least at this moment, the details of these theories or stories don’t matter.  What does matter is the general idea that once energy was introduced into the chaos of the void, something happened.  That “something” was some sort of movement, as that is the undebatable nature of energy; it’s always moving.  This energy moves in accordance with certain laws, and in the context of a duality.  This duality can be of somethingness/nothingness, 1/0, any polarity, or any difference between 2 things that can potentially interact.

#### **Key 5:** Everything exists in a state of duality.

The question then becomes, did these laws exist before creation? Did they exist in the chaotic primal void of nothingness? Well, the reasonable answer is yes&hellip; and no.  “No”, they did not exist in the primal void because these laws only apply where time and space exist, neither of which existed prior to the introduction of energy.  “Yes”, in that these laws must have existed “in theory”&hellip; e.g.  the relation of a circle’s circumference to its radius existed as the constant *pi* (&pi;), or the relationship between a circle and a square is an infinite regression, but as there were no circles or squares it was not measurable&hellip; there was no *instance* of *pi* (&pi;), but there was, for lack of a better word, an *archetype* of those relationships.  In this context, we are using the traditional and current definition of the word *archetype* as per the Oxford English Dictionary:

> The most typical or perfect example of a particular kind of person or thing

The only place where the potential for anything to exist, including concepts, ideas, or archetypes, is in a place where something *can* exist; a place where somethingness *coexists* with nothingness.  0 can exist, and &infin; can exist, but unless they commingle there will never be numbers (or anything else).  When they do mix, numbers appear, and with them, these archetypal laws, such as *&pi; r <sup>2</sup>* and *1+1=2*, become instantiated in reality.  “But!” you may be thinking, “If archetypes can only exist in a duality, and there was no duality before *somethingness* appeared in *nothingness*, how could the archetypes have existed?”  Well, they couldn’t, which suggests that there was a preexisting duality that our currently reality emerged from wherein these archetypes and laws already existed.  Perhaps that preexisting duality is a “sea” of infinite “waves” of uninstantiated possibilities forever crashing upon the shores of matter?  This poetic description also applies to what quantum mechanics calls the *wave functions* that represent all potential instances, but until one of those waves *collapses* into material form it will remain in the duality of lonely archetypes.  

In quantum physics, the only waves that will ever reach the shores of form are those that have the highest probability of doing so.  The realization of that which is most likely to happen will probably happen is not the profound part of this quantum insight.  The profound part is the realization that reality is a multidimensional cosmic casino.  We don’t know where an electron exists.  We only know the probability of where we might find an electron.  The probability field of an electron in your finger stretches out to the end of the universe, but the odds of finding one of your finger’s electrons on Zeta Reticuli 39.3 light years away is as likely as hitting the winning number on a roulette wheel with 10<sup>82</sup> numbers (that’s a roulette wheel 10<sup>76</sup> light-years wide in diameter which would take 10<sup>60</sup> years to spin just once if it was spinning at the speed of light - yes, this is a very silly, but nevertheless interesting detail).  Much more likely, your finger’s electron is very likely to be found where it is right now; in your finger&hellip;but there’s a *chance* it *could* appear on Zeta Reticuli, and for all you know, some of your electrons are there right now!  But even that’s not the most mind-blowing part, because if an electron is actually a wave that is described by a potential field, and that field extends to the end of the universe, than that electron is as big as the universe, that is, until it collapses into a femtometer-sized dot (that’s 10<sup>-15</sup> of a meter, or 0.000000000000001 m).  Every electron’s field in your body, and everything else, extends to every corner of existence… at least in the archetypal realm of laws that our reality exists within and to the best of our ability to understand those laws.

## Modern Concept, Ancient History

Without getting too much into philosophy here, the idea of archetypal forms is a very Platonic idea.  Plato’s *Theory of ideas* is the hypothesis that everything that exists is a material instance of an ideal version, or perfect idea, of that thing.

It is also a very Kant-ish idea, and a very Locke-ish, Descartes-ish and Hume-ish idea, for all these great thinkers, plus many more, had the understanding in one form or another that *things* were primarily *ideas* or *concepts* first.  Not all philosophers and scientists-of-old agreed, and in the good ol’ days the debate usually boiled down to some form of “is there a god?”[^7] Today, science tends to shy away from the concept of a god, but asks equally impossible questions, such as “is reality a hologram?” or “is existence a simulation?”, etc.  That question is answered in this book, but the answer is as maddening as it is enlightening, and words like “yes” or “no” become meaningless.

[^7]: This idea, and much more, is discussed at length in a 89 volume edition of great works that question the nature of existence.  Glattfelder, James B.

For pretty much all of man’s history there has been an archetypal, theoretical, spiritual, or mystical concept of a realm of ideas.  In this realm, forms, in their unmanifest, uninstantiated state, are simply ideas.  The perfect cube, for example, is a concept we all can grasp, but whose instances in the material world can only approach.  These archetypal forms follow archetypal laws for if they did not then the relationship between the area of a circle and its radius could just as well be “elephant toes on Tuesday afternoon”, or “cat dog moo”.

This concept that unmanifest forms are the same as ideas, existing in a non-physical, non-manifest, non-instantiated state, provides a very neat explanation as to the origin and nature of the laws of physics.  Just as physical forms, like the ball and the cube, have their ideal archetypes, the laws of physics and nature have their archetypal forms as well.

The laws of a form and the form itself are not separate things; they are the same thing in two different forms of expression.  Form itself is simply the result of a function, or by-product, of the law as it is expressed within some material context.  The form *is* the instantiation of the law.  A circle is defined by its law, 2*πr*, and what we see as a circle is an instance of this law.  Archetypes can also have archetypes, which we might refer to as *meta*-*archetype* or *meta-type*.  For example the *meta*-*type* or *meta*-*archetype* of circle (2*πr*) is the concept of a dot which is a 0-dimensional point.  

#### **Key 6:** Theories and ideas are an archetype in their own right, but like forms, they also have their own archetypes.

Laws are the blueprints of form, and forms are the instances of the blueprint. How do we know that the laws were not derived from the form, rather than the form being derived from the law? This is addressed in more depth further on, but the evidence is that the same laws exist across many forms.  One specific archetype, like that of a cube or a sphere, can have many instances, but a cube or a sphere cannot have many archetypes.  This puts the laws of form “higher” in the unfolding process of its creation, as the law must exist before the formation or instantiation of the law.  This is additionally supported by the idea that the laws themselves are an expression of energy, the ordering force behind all existence, and therefore a prerequisite to form, be it archetypal or material.

#### **Key 7:** Levels of order begin with energy, which has laws regarding how it interacts with itself, which form patterns (archetypes), which create things (have material instances).

You may be asking “OK, but what if Plato and the gang were wrong?”, but this is not a relevant question because that question assumes that we have access to, or can grasp, the “ultimate truth”, if one even exists.  Our theories of reality are predictive models based on our understanding and abilities that are valid for the reality we are able to observe.

#### **Key 8:** All theories are only valid for a level of awareness, a level of knowledge, the context of both of them and the limits of their application.

So, even if Plato is “wrong”, which at some level, at some point, in some reality, has to be true, if his ideas form the basis of understanding that allows us to create abstract concepts that can lead to new, testable understandings, then it is “true” until something better, or *more true*, comes along.  For the record, Aristotle rejected Plato’s ideas of forms and stated that all things can only come into existence via matter.  From the perspective of this book, both can be true, as one deals with the world of archetypes and ideas and the other strictly with materialism.  In both cases of *form* and the *laws of form,* there is one concept that simply expresses itself relative to the context of its scope of either ideas or matter.

Although today we tend to think of Plato’s *Theory of Ideas* as an abstraction, Plato was quite clear that this realm was as real as the realm we exist in every day, the difference being, in the material realm we can never know the true form or idea due to the limitations of material reality.  This is the basic theme of Plato’s *Allegory of the Cave,* which describes this reality as limited due to the fact that material form is no more than a mere shadow and echo of the true reality (of ideas and archetypes).  Parmenides (\~500 B.C.) also had the idea that the observable reality was a by-product of an underlying, hidden reality made up of an interconnected invisible network of the smallest possible things that can exist, a concept that was later adopted by Democritus (~400 B.C) when he coined the word “atom”.  These ancient ideas live on in modern theories that describe *massless matter* and suggest that matter itself can spontaneously come into existence out of nothing as a result of energy and order.

#### **Key 9:** Every thing that exists is an instance of archetypes.

Archetypes of form and the laws of those archetypes are the same things.  What we call archetypes of form are the results of these laws.  What we see in our reality are the instantiations of those archetypes.  Before continuing to explore the subject of energy, we need to first explore the subject of *order*, as they are inextricably bound to each other.
