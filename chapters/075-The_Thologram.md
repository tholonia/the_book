# 5: The Thologram

###### How the tholonic structure is defined

##### **Synopsis:** This chapter contains detailed explanations of how the thologram came into existence from nothingness and the structures of, and within, the thologram with real-world instances.  We explain and explore the thologram using geometry, math, colors, fractals, and numbers and apply some ancient and modern concepts to validate the redundancy of the thologram.

##### **Keywords:** generations, iterations, N-states, entropy, matrices, dimensionality, tholons, virtuality, binary, geometry

This chapter describes the thologram, how it came into being, and details about its properties.  As this book focuses more on the practical and, therefore, somewhat technical aspects of the origins and applications of Awareness and Intention rather than philosophical, metaphysical, or spiritual aspects, some technical content is unavoidable.  I have attempted to keep it as simple and brief as possible, but even if you are not a fan of geometry or math or have no interest, it’s worth at least a browse.

## Inner, not Outer

<img src='../Images/flower-of-life-dots.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>We have seen how the creation of a single trigram will automatically create additional trigrams as part of the same creative process.  This would imply an infinitely expanding realm of trigrams, as previously shown, and again shown in more detail in the image to the right.  When limited to 37 points, this pattern is often called the *flower of life*.  

The  *flower of life* design dates back to 1300 BC, with the oldest known instance carved on the temple walls of the ancient Egyptian temple “Osireion”.  Again, we see the same concepts and patterns appear over and over again in Man’s search for understanding using the power of reason.

The tholonic model sees this expansion a little differently.  If we are claiming that the first instance of creation, that of the 1 dot becoming 2, and the 2 becoming 3, etc., even if we are speaking metaphorically, then what we are also claiming is that this first trigram represents the very first polar duality created by the first non-polar duality of somethingness and nothingness.  This would imply that every duality and trigram that follows must exist *within* the first trigram, not outside of it.  Every succeeding duality can only be a subset of this first duality and certainly cannot exist outside the bounds of somethingness and nothingness.

We see a very different pattern if we draw our expanding trigrams such that the children are always contained *within* the parent.

<center><img src='../Images/061-tri-to-tho.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The NDC points represent the first trigram in this example diagram above (***Fig.  p1***).   ***Fig.  p2*** shows where a child N-State naturally forms along the CD spectrum. ***Fig.  p3*** shows the same process as ***Fig.  p1***, but as a child of the parent.  This *inwards* expansion (***Fig.  p3***) of the child N-State naturally terminates precisely at the limits of the parent’s boundaries, creating three additional trigrams. ***Fig.  p4*** shows the final form as a tetrahedron.

The *flower of life* represents an *external expansion* of the singularity.  In the thologram, the singularity creates a trigram which then creates infinite trigrams.  It is the expansion *within* that 1<sup>st</sup> trigram where movement and growth happen, as there is nothing outside that trigram.  From the scientific perspective, a singularity is a 0-dimensional point where some property is infinite.  In the case of the Universe and the Big Bang that created it, that property is gravity.  From the tholonic perspective, that property is Awareness and Intention.

In ***Fig.  p1***, the parent trigram, the order of NDC is clockwise, but the same three points of the resulting inner trigram are counter-clockwise.  These end points have not been reordered, as the original clockwise NDC is still there in the parent, but the child trigrams represent completely new creations with their own ordering.  The reason the children have a different order is because the new generation was spawned by the new N-source between C and D, and as D is always the first to follow N and always on the left of N (left, or *portside*, to be more accurate, is arbitrary, but we need to remain consistent).  This newly spawned D will appear on the opposite side of the parent’s D, and so for the C as well.  

We started with one trigram and one generation, resulting in 4 child trigrams.  Each generation of self-similar creation increases the number of trigrams by 4.  Here is what the generations look like.

<center><img src='../Images/062-4generations_fix.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

*Note: The progression of children for each generation grows at the rate  $4^{0} ,\ 4^{1} ,\ 4^{3} ,\ 4^{4} ,\ 4^{5},$ &hellip;  Notice that $4^{2}$  is skipped over.*

While this is the basic idea of the model, it is only half the story.  The more complete version is; rather than imagine yellow, cyan, and magenta as lines connecting the points, imagine 3 intermediary points: yellow, magenta, and cyan in-between the red, green, and blue points.  This creates a new trigram that starts with a yellow point, then creates a magenta and cyan corner point and their intermediary points of red, green, and blue points.

This is a critical concept, so it’s worth a demonstration.  We have specifically chosen the RGB/CMY color model because the RGB colors are *additive*, and  CMY colors are *subtractive*.

<center><img src='../Images/colortree-top.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

<img src='../Images/fig-t1.png' style='width:50px;float:left;'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>In the first case  (***Fig.  t1***)&hellip;



- Blue spawns green
- Green spawns red.
- Green and red (additively) create a new yellow.
- Yellow spawns a mixture of each of its component colors (red and green) with its parent color, blue, making cyan (created by blue and green) and magenta (created by blue and red).
- Magenta and cyan (subtractively) create a new blue.
- *Repeat*.

<img src='../Images/fig-t2.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/fig-t3.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>In the next case of (***Fig.  t2***), because this is an internally expanding process, each new generation creates a new layer that sits on top of the parent layer and is a mirror or inverse of the parent (***Fig.  t3***) creating an oscillation over generations and has its own contextual version of *frequency* and *wavelength*.   The oscillation is both generational and fractal, much like genetics which shares this same pattern of oscillation (detailed in “*The Tholonic I-Ching*”).  This is an important point to keep in mind, but going forward, we will only show the additive, primary, or *dominant* (to borrow a word from genetics) colors of RGB and ignore the subtractive, secondary, or *recessive* colors of CMY.

In the images and examples above, we use 6 colors to explain the tholon map.  These colors are based on the 3 natural primary and additive colors of RGB and their complimentary and subtractive colors of CMY.  These colors highlight many patterns, one of which shows that ultimately everything can be reduced to 2 colors, blue and yellow, for when we additively mix the left and right colors (red and green) that emerge from center blue, we get yellow, the center color of the child of blue, and when we subtractively mixed the left and right colors (cyan and magenta) that emerge from the center yellow, we get blue.

Below, we show the trigrams a bit differently, with the RGB as the points and the CMY as the lines, as this will make for less confusing 3-dimensional models.  On **Row 1**, we show the 6-color and the 2-color versions.  **Row 2** shows the patterns of the connecting CMY lines.  Here, we see 3 basic patterns; a left-handed cube grid, a right-handed cube grid, and a hexagonal grid.  The left and right-handed grids are so named to distinguish them as they are offset by half a “cube”.  With the added shading, it helps to conceptualize their difference.  The right-most image shows all the grids together.

**Row 3** shows the CMY lines along with the RGB NDC points they are related to, and the **Row 4** line shows the same in 2 colors.

**Row 5** shows a 4-generation, 2-color, 2-dimensional thologram and compares that model with the traditional *Flower of Life*, which uses the same pattern and reasoning, but unlike the thologram, it is external and non-reflective.

<center><img src='../Images/tris2clr.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

<center><img src='../Images/4FOL.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

<img src='../Images/fig-p2.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>We also see a few other interesting details in the way the trigram is formed, such as how the *Contribution* of red is introduced into the *Definition* of green (on the right side) <img src='../Images/right-div.png' style='height:14pt'/>.  Can we say the same thing for how green is introduced into the red <img src='../Images/left-div.png' style='height:14pt'/>, such as it appears on the left side? No, because there is an order to the points of *blue &rightarrow; green &rightarrow; red*.  Green existed *before* red; therefore, it is the red that is introduced to the already existing green point.

In other words, the reality of a thing contributes to the definition of a thing, and the definition of a thing is limited by the reality of a thing.  This is so obvious it sounds silly to even state, but here we are dealing with the most fundamental properties of creations,  which are the simplest, obvious, and basic laws.

In the world of math and geometry, this internally expanding trigram is similar to something called a *Sierpinski Triangle*, which is a foundational pattern in nature that has many real-world applications, such as broadband antennas, musical composition, mathematics, and chemistry.

The difference between the thologram and the Sierpinski Triangle is in the Sierpinski Triangle, there is the concept of 2 types of trigrams, those that are capable of self-replication (the black trigrams), and those that are (the white trigrams), like this:

<center><img src='../Images/063-serp.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

In the thologram, we consider the trigram not as an object but as the boundaries that constrain the movement of energy.  The fact that the center trigram is a reversal of the three outer trigrams is evidence of the significance of this inner trigram.  This difference between the thologram and the Sierpinski Triangle is only conceptual because the math is essentially the same.  Still, the thologram considers the negative or empty space as valid as the filled space, with different attributes, which we’ll demonstrate.

<img src='../Images/064-hexagram.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>With each generation, we have more and more patterns, such as Fibonacci and harmonic series, but perhaps the most dominant pattern is the hexagon.  In addition to being the crystalline structure of hydrogen, it is one of nature’s most persistent and useful shapes.  It can be seen in beehives, Saturn’s north pole, dragonfly eyes, rocks, bubbles, snowflakes, organic chemistry, memory function in the brain, neuronal firing patterns, etc., as well as being the most structurally sound of all shapes.  The success of the hexagon is because it is a synergetic form, meaning it is a form that can self-assemble and hierarchically self-organize.  All synergetic systems, such as all organic life (and arguably the Universe and all its creations), are built upon synergetic principles.

A single layer of hexagonally oriented carbon atoms forms a material called *graphene*.  Graphene is superconductive[^402], can convert light into energy [^403], can propagate electromagnetic signals[^404], and given its organic structure, easily integrates into organic systems, such as plants and animals. [^405]<sup>,</sup>[^406]  This structure is not only the basis for life but is the basis for integrating organic life with technology.  From the tholonic view, organic life *is* technology, so what is commonly referred to as *trans-humanism*, the merging of the biotechnology of nature and technology of humans, is a natural phase of evolution (although the way this is being approached today, and by whom, leaves a lot to be desired as our current path does not appear to be in the best interest of humanity and unless radially altered, which is unlikely, will result is consequences that will be as catastrophic as they could have been miraculous).

The tholonic structure is not simply a geometrical metaphor but a functioning model and is fundamental to *plasmonics*.  Plasmonics, or what is sometimes called *nanoplasmonics*, is the term for electrical interfaces at light frequencies which allow it to perform operations such as changing the direction of light and using light as the source of energy and has the potential of creating electric circuits as small as 10 nanometers.  That is 10,000 times smaller than a human hair, or the amount your fingernail grows in one second.  Below is a diagram of a *plasmonic* antenna that can receive energy and information and can be integrated into organs, the nervous system, the brain, etc., and is about as close to a tholonic device as can be built.

<center><img src='../Images/gold.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

In the tholonic patterns, we can see how the N-sources converge to form the center of every hexagon and how the opposite colors always form pairs on the outer edge.  From this, we get a much better idea of the nature of 0-dimensional, non-existent N-sources, which are, unsurprisingly, at the center of order.  We get some clues for answering the question, “*Where did the first N-source come from?*”  

Another exciting observation is the little blue dots in the middle of the yellow lines.  Why are they important?  Those blue dots mark the center of a line that can create new children (stable patterns) or new N-states that form new N-sources.  You’ll notice that those lines only exist on the outer ring of the hexagon.

<img src='../Images/065_n-sources.png' style='float:right;width:39%'/>As we saw earlier, the N-source (blue) is the progenitor of the subsequent D (green) and C (red) dots and therefore must always precede D and C.  However, D and C, having all the attributes of the N, can create a new child version of N.  N and D cannot create a new N because it does not have the attributes of C (form), nor can N and C create a new N as it does not have the attributes of D (definition).  Only Ns, or N-states, can be created because N-states have no form or dimension, a prerequisite for creating something out of nothing.  An N-state is simply an idea or concept.  Cs and Ds are no longer merely concepts; they have dimension and form.

How a 0-dimensional dot becomes dimensional, which then becomes form, is significant because it shows that even though archetypes can appear across the NC and ND spectrums, they cannot create children, so no N-state will ever appear across these spectrums.  However, the CD spectrum, which is the axis of *cooperation* or *conflict* and its opposing point of *negotiation*, can create N-states.  As the trigram self-replicates, the hexagram naturally rotates 60&deg; with each iteration, allowing every side of the thologram (4 or more trigrams, or anything after the 1<sup>st</sup> generation)  to be able to generate new N-sources.  The graph above (***Fig.  h1***) shows the lines connecting the N-sources and their respective N-states (the blue dots).  What it shows is that anything that exists will have 3 N-state axes, or 3 expressions, types of instances, and perspectives, that together represent the complete concept.

### Everything Begins with the Trigram

Just as every element in the periodic table is formed from hydrogen, so is every generation of the thologram formed from the trigram.

A curious observation is if you take the simplest material version of the trigram (hydrogen, atomic number = 1) and the simplest material version of the hexagon (carbon, atomic number = 6), the two most fundamental forms in the thologram, and combine them (6+1=7) you happen to get hydrocarbons, the most basic building blocks of life (and a bunch of plastic stuff), as all life is hydrocarbon-based.  

We can also apply the same associative reasoning to the thologram as a whole to show how its structure appears as a pattern of growth in nature.  An example of this can be seen in the images below, illustrating the thologram as it grows from an infinitely self-similar 0-dimensional dot to a 1-dimensional line to a 2-dimensional area in the process of distributing itself, balancing its energy and increasing its entropy.

We say that the 0D dot is infinitely self-similar because there are an infinite number of 0s in 0 ($0^\infty\rightarrow0$).  Expanding an infinitely self-similar 0D dot into 1 dimension creates an infinitely self-similar 1D line as there is an infinite number of 1s in this 1D line (as $1^\infty\rightarrow1$).  The expansion into 2D space is where we see these self-similar children unfold (as $2^\infty\rightarrow\infin$).  For each dimension that follows, these children would unfold to occupy that space, $3^\infty\rightarrow\infin$, $4^\infty\rightarrow\infin$, etc.

<center><img src='../Images/066-serp-growth-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

<img src='../Images/063-serp3.png' style='float:right;width:20%;'/>In the previous example of a Sierpinski triangle, the outer trigrams were solid black, and the center was white.  As a 2D *parton*, this white space represents the center trigram.  As a 3D *parton* it represents the base of the tetrahedron.  As a 2D *holon*, the white represents all the centers of all the children of all the generations, and as a 3D *holon*, the white space forms the 3D shape of an octahedron  (much more on this later), which remains empty.

In the diagram above, we are using the Sierpinski triangle again and only showing the borders of the trigrams, which implicitly incorporates the “empty” center trigram.  This negative space is just as full of implicit patterns as the positive space is full of explicit patterns, but these implicit patterns exist as a *result of* the explicit patterns, which are continually expanding inwards.  In every generation of a 3D tholon, exactly and always 50% of each tholon is the *nothingness* of empty space, and 50% is the *somethingness* of the 4 children it creates.  The octahedral space is never divided, but the tetrahedral space is always divided by 4.  As the tetrahedrons produce form (e.g., the tholons that produce reality), it is form (and reality) that is forever approaching the nothingness of 0.  The ever-shrinking tholons correlate with the ever-decreasing energy availability (increased entropy), which both lead to the same destination of total dispersion and balancing of energy. 

### 2D to 3D

<center><img src='../Images/tatom_cuttri_simply.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

So far, all we have described are 2D trigrams.  It’s been shown how the 2D shape of trigrams defines a 3D tetrahedron, but nothing has been said about how this self-similar grid of trigrams becomes a self-similar grid of 3D tetrahedrons.

*A note on the colors used: When coloring 2-dimensional trigrams, the color choices are straightforward because the RGB/CMY model is tertiary.  When we move the 2D trigram to a 3D tetrahedron, a new dimension appears, represented by the white-dot created by the 3 pure colors.  This naturally adds a new dimension of lightness to our colors, but this also means that all sides of a tholon are different.  As a tetrahedron, rather than 2 colors mixing to make a new color, which in 2D only happens on one face, 3 colors are mixing with white, creating a lighter shade of each color.  This is being mentioned because the reader may notice a difference between the coloring of 2D and 3D models.  To get a broader perspective of the color scheme and the forms, the image below shows all 4 sides formed by 1 tetrahedron.  The right images shows how 2 tetrahedrons, one RGB and one CMY, separate and combine.*

<center><img src='../Images/tsides.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We demonstrated how a 0-dimensional dot expands into a trigram.

<center><img src='../Images/068-dot2tri.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

Below is a more complete, step-by-step description of how this trigram expands into the thologram.  

<center><img src='../Images/068-dot2tholon2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

*Note: For clarity’s sake, each generation of tholon children is referred to as **generations**, while the tholons that are created from the peaks of these original tholons, and their children, are referred to as **iterations**.*

Tholons model the movement of energy and consider the existence of form as the consequence of that movement.  With that in mind, let’s examine the tholonic explanation using the figures above.

<img src='../Images/fig-a.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>***Fig.  a.*** We start with a simple trigram.  This defines the most fundamental structure of how instantiations of archetypes come to exist and, therefore, the flow of energy and their resulting forms.

<img src='../Images/fig-a1.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>***Fig a1***.  The movement of energy inside this trigram will cause a new trigram to form by the expansion of N-sources due to the flow of energy.  The most likely place for this new form is opposite the energy source and in the balanced center between the two limiting poles created by the source.  Expanding this new N-source further divides, defines, or limits the parent’s scope, resulting in 4 new trigrams.  

This division process is the basis of the thologram and, we claim, the basis of all creation, so it’s worth a bit more explanation.

<center><img src='../Images/tri-rotations.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

In the image above, *Holon View* shows this division from the parent’s perspective.  The resulting divisions produce trigrams that are transformed in a manner shown by *Transforms* where each outer trigram is a transformation of 180&deg; rotation of the center trigram, which is the same transformation of the parent trigram.  This result is the top trigram being identical to the parent trigram, but similarly transformed around a different axis.  All total, 4 transformations take place, each of 180&deg;, for a total of 720&deg;, or two complete rotations of a cycle.  As a holon, the core trigram is the center trigram, and each outer trigram is a different context of *Negotiation*, *Definition*, or *Contribution* for that tholon.

The “parton view” shows the divisions as 4 independent trigrams, each with its own 3 points of NDC.  However, as only blue N-sources can create the red and green children, the trigrams operate differently as independent elements resulting in different colors (properties), showing us that the same instance shares different properties of holons and partons.  Consequently, when all the partons are working together, not as a holon, but as integrated partons, which contributes to the holon, the dots <img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'> and <img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'>result in 2 yellow dots.  Why yellow and not brown ( <img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'>+<img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'>+<img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'>=<img src='../Images//dot-RRG.png' style='height:10px'>) and dark green (<img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'>+<img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'>+<img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'>=<img src='../Images//dot-RGG.png' style='height:10px'>)?  Because we are not considering the quantity of the properties but rather the qualities, as in the relationships between the properties and, as was previously shown, the <img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'>$\leftrightarrow$<img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'>relationship is one of definition and contribution, or limitation and form,  imposing on one another.  In this example, the color yellow represents challenges, trials, testing, contention, and cooperation.  Not coincidentally, this fits quite nicely as the opposite of yellow is blue, which, in this example, is the color of unity, 1, the singularity. 

<img src='../Images/whitecenter.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/> In *3<sup>rd</sup> Generation*, this same process takes place in each of the child trigrams, and we get the 1<sup>st</sup> instance of a hexagon, but not a single hexagon, but a trigram of 3 hexagons.  It is difficult to see in the image above, but if we zoom in (right image) on these 3 primal hexagons, we see that the core of the top hexagon is a mixture of blue and yellow, which is white, and the 2 lower hexagons have a core that is red and green, which is yellow. 

*Note:  Colors are used in this example because colors are another way to see the rules of energy in action, but we are not claiming these colors have these properties, as other expressions of energy could have also been used in this example, but as they are invisible, it would be difficult to show the relationships.* 

As was shown above, the arrangement of the colored points (N, D, & C) in each outer trigram is the exact reverse image of the center trigram.  One way to think about it is the original trigram (top-most) reflects and reverses itself and, by doing so, creates a new trigram (center), which also reflects and reverses itself in the 2 new trigrams (left and right).  In this way, the center trigram acts like a reverse reflection trigram, and the 2 new trigrams are a reversed reflection of a reversed reflection.  This will be an important point a little bit later.

*Note: We will use colors (RGB) rather than types (NDC) because it is easier to understand the geometry of a tholon using well-understood concepts like colors.  You can remember that N=blue, D=green, and C=red, but it does not really matter for these descriptions.  When it does matter, we will return to NDC labels.*

<img src='../Images/fig-a2.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>***Fig.  a2***.  Because energy always follows the path of least resistance and always seeks balance, this complete tholon will automatically become a self-sustaining structure (tetrahedron) when all the conditions are met, as it would represent the most efficient form.  These conditions appear to require 4 types of points; <img src='../Images//dot-blue.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-blue.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-blue.png' style='height:10px'>BBB, <img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-blue.png' style='height:10px'>RGB, <img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'>RGR, and <img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'><img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'>GRG.  Apparently, <img src='../Images//dot-blue.png' style='height:10px'>B points only integrate with themselves and with an <img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'>R and <img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'>G together, while the <img src='../Images//dot-red.png' style='height:10px'>R and <img src='../Images//dot-green.png' style='height:10px'>G can integrate with each other.

We see the above pattern when any 2 things interact with each other ,*and* can form more energetically stable, efficient, balanced relationships.  For example, hydrogen and oxygen atoms form a stable state that requires less energy or conserves energy than both require to maintain a separate existence.  

<img src='../Images/fig-a3.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>***Fig.  a3***.  Each of these child trigrams goes through the same process as the parent, with slightly different parameters determined by their parent’s limitation.  We can now see 4 trigrams of 4 trigrams in their 2D form.

<img src='../Images/fig-a4.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>***Fig.  a4***.  This is a 4<sup>th</sup> generation tholon map.  To get an idea of how many sets of tetrahedrons it holds, the trigrams have been color-coded to make it easy to see.  The darker colors represent what will be the base of a tetrahedron, with the light shade of the same colors representing their sides.  You’ll notice that there are six sets of trigrams that are yellow (or a lighter shade of gray).  These are identified a little differently because when they form a tetrahedron, they do so by going in the opposite direction because they are a reversed reflection image.

<img src='../Images/fig-a5.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>***Fig.  a5***.  If we go ahead and form the tetrahedrons, we end up with a series of tetrahedrons connected at the corners, some pointing forward and some pointing away (the more faded ones).  You’ll notice that every odd-numbered row (rows 1,3,5,7) are all *forward* trigrams (trigrams with blue N-state parents), which we’ll refer to as *real*, a term taken from the world of holography to indicate that the image is projecting in front of the film.  Likewise, all even-numbered rows (rows 2,4,6) point in the opposite direction (trigrams with yellow N-state parents).  We’ll call these *virtual* tholons, a term also taken from the world of holography, referring to an image that *virtually* exists behind the holographic plate.  For every pair of rows (1&2, 3&4, 5&6) there are an equal number of real and virtual tholons.

This structure may look familiar to a mineral chemist, as this is the same structure as the silicon dioxide crystal *tridymite* (shown below), a form of quartz.  Other silica-based oxides also share a similar structure.  This detail is mentioned later in this chapter when we look at how water also shares this structure.

<center><img src='../Images/cristobalite.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

<img src='../Images/fig-b1.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>***Fig.  b1***.  This is a side view and elevated view of 5 generations folded into tetrahedrons.  Those pointing up are *real*, and those pointing down are *virtual*.  This is where we see the first instance of oscillation, with the tholons alternating in their movement away from and towards their originating plane or between the virtual and real states.

<img src='../Images/fig-b2.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>But what is happening in ***Fig.  b2***? Why are there more tholons stacked on top and on the bottom?  If you managed to slug through up to this point, congratulations! Here is where we get to see the engine of creation.  Each of these new trigrams formed by the peaks of the previous children acts as the base for new, larger tholons! The process that created the first tetrahedron starts over, not only for each one of these trigrams but for every face of a tholon or trigram, including its children (which can’t be shown here as it is too complex and detailed for a 2D print image).

<img src='../Images/fig-b3.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>How can new tetrahedrons appear?  You’ll notice that the peaks of the original tetrahedrons are the *white dots*<img src='../Images/053-whitedot.png' style='width:0.233in'/>, which is to say, each peak has the attributes of red, green and blue, allowing them to act as a red dot, green dot, or blue dot<img src='../Images/070-rgbdot2.png' style='width:0.23in'/>, and if they *can* act as R, G, and B dots, they *will*.  When they do, they naturally create a new generation of white dots.  If we start with a finite set of folded tetrahedrons, eventually, this ever-growing iteration of tetrahedrons will end, as each iteration’s number of *real* tholons is less by one generation, and the number of *virtual* tholons is less by two generations.

<img src='../Images/fig-b1.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/fig-b2.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/fig-b3.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>Each iteration builds on the one before it, making larger and larger tholons, as you can see in ***Figs.  b1, b2, b3***, which shows the progression of real and virtual tholons.[^69]Interestingly, the growth pattern of tholons is the inverse of a recursive Fibonacci sequence.  Inverse, because we are multiplying instead of dividing, recursive because we do that for each trigram, children of trigrams, children of children of trigrams, etc.

[^69]: As a relevant aside, this reversing effect has a material analog called the *Janibekov effect* (among other names).  This phenomenon is well established in the field of mechanics and is most easily observed in space where there is no gravity.  On observing this effect for the first time, one would think the impossible is happening, but it is a basic law of energy that we rarely see here on Earth because of gravity. 
The *Janibekov effect* is when an asymmetrical rigid body, like a wing-nut or a handle, rotating around one of its axis, suddenly flips 180&deg;, and continues to rotate around the same axis but in a reverse position.  After a few moments, it flips again and continues flipping back and forth indefinitely.  It does this because the lowest energy state, which is the state that all matter seeks, requires the maximum amount of inertia, and the maximum amount of inertia will always be where the most mass is.
Given that the object is asymmetrical, the amount of mass for each axis will change, causing the object to change position.  A quick search for “Janibekov effect” will yield many fascinating videos on this phenomenon and shows how energy operates in form and, presumably, in the archetypes of form, given are tholons and tholons are asymmetrical.

<img src='../Images/fig-c0T.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/fig-c1T.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/fig-c2T.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/fig-c3T.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>It is difficult to imagine how each side of a tetrahedron can go through this same process, but we can imagine the final state.  ***Fig.  c0*** shows an orthogonal view of the tholonic matrix on all four sides of a 2D tholonic map, as in ***Fig.  a1***.  ***Fig.  c1*** shows the perspective view, with *real* tholons above and *virtual* tholons below.  ***Fig.  c2*** shows the same perspective view, but where the sides have begun to fold up to form a tetrahedron.  ***Fig.  c3*** shows the final view with the real tholons creating a tetrahedron and the virtual tholons projected out from each side of the tetrahedron.

It looks like we have broken the rule that no children can exist outside their parent’s limits because we have a lot of virtual tholons sticking way outside those limits.  Virtual tholons are reverse reflections of the parent tholons.  In one sense, these *virtual* tholons do not exist any more than your reflection in the mirror puts you on the other side of the wall, but it *does* exist in that the reflection is a perfect mirror-image representation of you, and this has significant value as mirrors have a measurable effect on energy (light).  It is an illusion, but an illusion that affects reality.  

We started with a 2D map that was folded into a 3D form, and in the 3D space, no more folding can occur, but the 3D form can be folded into a 4D form, which can be folded into a 5D form, etc.  We end up with a thologram that is a perfect tetrahedron made of an (approaching) infinite number of smaller tholons.  On the 4 outer-most surfaces of this tetrahedron is a single layer of the tholonic matrix of *real* and *virtual* tholons, with the *virtual* tholons facing outwards into *nothingness*. 

<img src='../Images/tho3.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>While the outer form of *real* tetrahedrons looks like a tetrahedron,  it consists of 4 child tetrahedrons, each made of 4 child tetrahedrons, ad infinitum.   This tetrahedral stacking leaves gaps.  The shape of that gap is that of an *octahedron*, or a *square bipyramid*.  This is mentioned because the tetrahedron and the octahedron can be converted into each other by means of the Golden mean (phi, &phi;, 1.618), and together they form a pair of shapes that can fill every part of space (*tessellation*).  The only other shape that can do that is a cube, which is itself defined by 2 tetrahedrons.  In other words, the only archetypal forms that can occupy all space are the forms that are created by the tetrahedron.  

Besides being an interesting factoid, the tessellating abilities of these forms are surprisingly informative, at least regarding the thologram.  For example, in the thologram, there are tholons (tetrahedrons) and octahedral gaps.  These gaps represent nothing, or rather, *nothingness*, as there is nothing there.  Perhaps that is why the octahedron is the least “dense” of all polyhedrons (“dense” is the geometry term that refers to the number of times a polygon boundary wraps around the center).  The only difference between the void of nothingness and the nothingness of this gap is the difference between limitlessness and the limits imposed by the tholons that define the shape of this nothingness.  As this limited nothingness is in the form of an octahedron, it is the octahedron that represents *nothingness* in the context of *somethingness*.  The tessellating ability of the tetrahedron and the octahedron is a representation of the reality that everything that exists is composed of *somethingness* and *nothingness*.  The cube, the only *single* shape that can tessellate, is the basis of both *nothingness* and *somethingness*, from the tholonic perspective.

<img src='../Images/tetprog.png' style='float:right;width:38%'/>A pair of tetrahedrons make a cube, and if we connect the centers of each face of that cube, we get an octahedron.  So, the octahedron is the result of the cube, and the cube is the result of the tetrahedron.  This defines the natural order of progression as tetrahedrons &rarr; cube &rarr; octahedron <img src='../Images/order2.png' style='height:12px'/>.  In addition, a complete tholon (which is described in more detail later) is both a *real* tholon ***and*** its *virtual* counterpart, so from a tholonic perspective, the cube, which 2 tetrahedrons can create, is actually created by a single *complete tholon*.

**The Shape of Reality**

<img src='../Images/exploded.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>What does this have to do with reality and the Universe? We know a tessellated tetrahedron can be formed with 4 tetrahedrons and 1 octahedron, but an octahedron, the shape of *nothingness*, can also be formed with 4 tetrahedrons and 6 octahedrons.  These tessellated structures illustrate that both *somethingness* and  *nothingness* are self-similar and fractal.  If we assign the length of a side to 1, or *unity*, we can see that a tetrahedron has a volume of 0.11785 (*V<sub>t1</sub>*), and an octahedron has a volume of 0.4714 (*V<sub>o1</sub>*).  If 4 tetrahedrons and 6 octahedrons create a tessellated octahedron, I there any relevance to their relative? Yes, quite a bit.  The total volume of the tetrahedrons comes to 0.4714 (0.11787 x 4, *V<sub>t4</sub>*), and octahedrons comes to 2.828 (0.4714 x 6, V<sub>o6</sub>).  the 1<sup>st</sup> thing we discover is that the total volume of the tetrahedrons is equal to the singular volume of an octahedron, *V<sub>t4</sub>=V<sub>o1</sub>*.  More interesting is that the ration of $\frac{V_{o6}}{V_{t4}}$ (or $\frac{nothingness}{somethingness}$) is 6:1, which is to say, *somethingness* represent $\frac{1}{6}$, or 16.666%, of *nothingness*.  That sounds ridiculous, that is, until we discover that it is not: 

> “In January 2015, the results of the Planck satellite of the European Space Agency (ESA) were published.  The high sensitivity of Planck allowed us to estimate the amount of matter and energy in the Universe with a precision of just a few percent.  In particular, we now know that all forms of matter as we know them (atoms, radiation, and all sorts of exotic particles) only account for 16% of the Universe’s matter, the rest being in an unknown form that is usually referred to as dark matter.”[^457]

[^457]: “**Where Is the Universe’s Ordinary Matter?**” Where is the Universe's ordinary matter? | Laboratory News.  Accessed November 5, 2022.  https://www.labnews.co.uk/article/2026102/where_is_the_universe_s_ordinary_matter.

 We could call this a fascinating coincidence, or we might wonder if the shapes that can describe all matter and occupy all space might have a relationship to&hellip; all matter and all space.  If so, then dark-matter appears to be how *nothingness* instantiates in our material Universe. 

But there might be much mote to this incredibly coincidental relationship.  For example, we live in a Newtonian world where *cause* is followed by *effect*, mass and energy follow the rules, and nothing travels faster than the speed of light, thereby preventing “spooky actions at a distance”, to quote Einstein.  Everything we think, believe, and build is based on these laws of reality, and millions upon millions of tests prove that reality is built on these laws.

Then quantum physics crashed the party.  Now, tossing a coin a million times may or may not result in 50/50 heads/tails.  The *Bell Inequality Theorem* make the quite reasonable claim that if the laws of reality can be broken, then reality, truth, and facts as we know them are not what we think they are.  That was in 1964, and  since 1972 scientists have been using reality, truth, and facts to prove that reality, truth, and facts may not be real, true, or factual.

Without getting into the details, an experiment was set up with conditions where the results of 2 tests could only be 0 or ±1 according to Newtonian and Relativistic laws of *realism* and *locality*.   If the test results went past ±2, that would prove that reality as we know it is not reality as it actually is.  The test results were in the range of ±2.828.  This test is called the  *CSHS Witness Experiment*[^458].

[^458]: Team, The Qiskit. “**Local Reality and the CHSH Inequality.**” qiskit.org.  Data 100 at UC Berkeley, July 6, 2022.  https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-demos/chsh.html.

I personally ran this experiment using quantum spin on IBM’s quantum computer (image below), not that I doubted the claims of brilliant scientists.  I just wanted to see it for myself.  Discovering new realities is fun and interesting, but the real miracle of this test is that humanity has created the tools and infrastructure that allows anyone to access a quantum computer and reality-testing experiments from a flat with limited water, stolen electricity, and a collapsing ceiling, in a poor neighborhood in an economically and politically devastated South American country, which is where I happened to be when I ran this test.

<center><img src='../Images/CSHS.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Besides proof that reality is not what we think it is, it also shows that the difference between our Newtonian and quantum models of reality was between 2 and 2.828.  What jumps out is how this ratio of $\frac{2.828}{2}$ is $\sqrt{2}$.  OK, that’s interesting, not just because the 2 different realities are based on the same pattern, e.g, $2\times\sqrt{1}=2$ for Newtonian results, and $2\times\sqrt{2}=2.828$ for quantum results, but also because we see this same pattern in the volumes of 6 octahedra (*V<sub>o6</sub>*) and 6 tetrahedra (*V<sub>t6</sub>* )!

How so? *V<sub>o6</sub>* = $\sqrt{2}\times2$, or 2.828, and its inverse is *V<sub>t6</sub>*  = $\sqrt{2}\div2$, or 0.7071.  This further confirms that the tetrahedron and the octahedron are a pair of opposites, 2 sides to the same coin of reality.  Together they create the value of 2, as $V_{o6}\times V_{t6}=2$, but when compared, $\frac{2.828}{0.7071}=\frac{\sqrt{2}\times2}{\sqrt{2}\div2}=\frac{4}{1}$, they create the ratio of 4:1 (or 1:4, depending on the direction of the math), suggesting that it takes 4 to create *unity*.  And what is 4? It is the 3<sup>rd</sup> instance of the binary tree that begins with 1, i.e., 1&rarr;2&rarr;4.  And where do we see how all these patterns come together?  In the tholon, a tetrahedron is made of tetrahedrons.

We also see the octahedral/tetrahedral patterns of the tholon in other ways.  For example, an octahedron is 2 essentially tetrahedrons in that an octahedron has 8 trigram faces, and a tetrahedron has 4 trigram faces.  

We can see the relationship between tetrahedra and octahedra in the image below.

<img src='../Images/OToverlap-4.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>***a)*** is the simplest possible pattern from which tetrahedrons and octahedrons can be made.

In ***b)*** and ***c)*** we see the pattern that creates 6 octahedrons.  These are the only 2 unique patterns that can create an octahedron, as any other pattern is just a reversed and/or flipped version of these patterns.  Outside of the context of an octahedron, we can see that ***b)*** and ***c)*** are the same pattern but shifted by exactly $\frac{2}{7}$ of the pattern for an octahedron.  Why is the pattern divided into 7 sections?  Because the 6 trigrams that define the width of the set of trigrams for an octahedron create 8 vertical divisors, and 8 divisors create 7 divisions.  We also see this natural division in the *periodic* table of elements, which classifies all elements into 7 *periods*.  We’ll refer to these patterns as *left-hand* octahedrons and *right-hand* octahedrons.

In ***d)*** we see we can create 12 tetrahedrons from this same pattern.  This pattern is perfectly symmetrical.

In ***e)*** we combine all three patterns and their colors (additively).

We see how 12 tetrahedrons can become 6 *right-hand* octahedrons or 6 *left-hand* octahedrons.  This creates a triad of a tetrahedron with a pair of opposing octahedrons.  To put it tholonically, *somethingness* creates 2 types of *nothingness*.  We can tie this back to the earlier subject of chaos;   *nothingness* is chaos, and as there are 2 types of chaos, low-entropy, and high-entropy, we can say that the existence of something creates low-entropy chaos or high-entropy chaos.  This is compatible with the archetypes just shown as well as reality.

In the same way, a cube is 2 tetrahedrons in that a cube has 8 vertices, and the 8 vertices of 2 tetrahedrons perfectly match those of the cube.  However, this vertices relationship, which is very efficient and tidy in 3D, is a complete mess in 2D.

<center><img src='../Images/cubemap.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

This tells us that a tetrahedron has a fundamental, more primitive, and therefore a higher priority relationship with an octahedron than a cube.  However, the octahedron has a closer relationship with the cube in 3D space.

A tetrahedron has a 1:1 ratio of faces to vertices, with 4 faces and 4 vertices, and is the most balanced and stable form that can exist in 3D space and is composed of only the most balanced and stable form that can exist in 2D space, the trigram, with 1 face and 3 vertices.  From the tetrahedron form, in 2D space, we can create the octahedron, which has 8 faces and 6 vertices, a 4:3 ratio.  In 3D space, the tetrahedron can define a cube, with 6 faces and 8 vertices, a 3:4 ratio.

The inverted ratios make the cube and the octagon an inverted pair.  We end up with a 6-step progression from dot &rarr; line &rarr; trigram &rarr; tetrahedron &rarr; octahedron &rarr; cube.  For this reason, the cube, which incorporates all previous components of dot, line, trigram, tetrahedron, and tetrahedron, defines the crystal structure of 90% of the elements, which are cubic-based.  9 elements that you never heard of and are extremely rare are double-hexagonal.  However, there are only 3 hexagonal elements.  If our reasoning above was correct, we would expect these 3 elements to be more fundamental than the cubic elements, are they are.  These elements are hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, 3 of the 4 most common elements on this planet (oxygen, the simplest of all cubic structures, being the 4<sup>th</sup>), and which are the required elements to create life (proteins).  Of course, hydrogen is the most common element in the Universe and the source of all other elements.  

This creates a new perspective of the tholon.  These 3 related structures are 3 different perspective of a singular concept, similar to how current, voltage, and resistance is to the concept of electricity, or force, acceleration, and mass are to motion.  With these geometric shapes it is easy to visually see how they relate.  We can see that the octahedron and the cube are the exact same structure, but are slightly “off” centered from each other.  We can also see that the tetrahedron defines the vertices of both of those structures.  We could say the tetrahedron defined the potential of the other 2 structures.  In the same way, we could say that the 3 axis of the octahedron defines the limits of of the shape, as in the *x*, y, and *z* of 3D space, and the cube is the maximum possible expressions of that the potential limited by the *x*, *y* and *z* space.  This very neatly equates the tetrahedron &rarr; voltage, octahedron &rarr; resistance, and cube &rarr; current,    and, therefore, tetrahedron &rarr; *Negotiation*, octahedron &rarr; *Definition*, and cube &rarr; *Contribution*.  

How does *Negotiation* (balance) equate to voltage?  As was mentioned, the Negotiated state is a balanced pattern of energy that has emerged within a duality.  What is implied then is that this movement of energy creates pressure, and electromotive pressure *is* voltage.  An imbalanced state can not sustain the movement of energy.  The greater the balance, the more it can sustain the movement of energy.  In short, a *Negotiated* state allows for the movement of energy which creates pressure which is voltage.

<center><img src='../Images/tetcuboct-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Previously, we referred to the tetrahedron/octahedron/cube as symbolic of *somethingness/nothingness/form*, and while that is true in a symbolic sense, it is obviously not true in the real sense, as the octahedral is an actual shape that is ubiquitous in nature, such as in fluorite, diamonds, and other minerals.  Likewise, there is no such as a total nothingness or total somethingness.  However, we do have the concept of that which is receptive, dark, cold, dead, infinite (nothingness) and that which is creative, light, hot, energetic, and finite (somethingness).  These concepts have been around since we grokked the difference between dead and alive over 2.5 million years ago.  The modern world has its own versions in concepts such as physics’ protons/electrons, technology’s 0/1, finance’s debt/credit, Descartes’ mind/body, science’s reductionism/holism, hierarchy/unity, concrete/abstract, evolution/devolution, discrete/continuum, time/space, etc.

Such modern dualities are as neatly encapsulated in the ancient Taoist concept of *yin* and *yang* as were the dualities of our distant ancestors.  When speaking about the material word where *somethingness* and *nothingness* have no real instances, it’s more practical to speak in terms of *yin*/*yang*.  Tholonically, we can say *yin* is the movement from order to high-entropy, and *yang* is the movement from low-entropy chaos to order.  We can also say that any patterns or structure that allows for the the distribution of energy is *yang*, and the actual distribution of energy as *yin*.

In this context, the octahedron is *yin* in nature, while the cube is yang in nature.  Likewise, *body-centered* cubic structures (cube) are *yang* in nature, while *face-centered* cubic structures (octahedron) are *yin* in nature.  As an aside, there are 2 elements that combine both structures: silicon and germanium.  These are called *diamond cubic* structures (technically, it is a form of face-centered cubic).  Silicon, along with oxygen, is one of the main building blocks of planet Earth.  Germanium is rare.

We can see this duality in chemistry when we look at the periodic table, as all the alkali metals (H, Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr) in the left-most are *body-centered* cubic structures and are *very* interactive with other elements.  These would be considered *yang* in nature.  All the right-most column elements are the “noble” gasses (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn), so named because they stand alone and don’t interact with anything unless they have to.  These are all  *face-centered* cubic structures and are *yin* in nature.  Now we can see the entire periodic chart as moving form *yang* (left) to *yin* (right).

Further confirming the order of these 3 archetypal shapes is how the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> shapes, the tetrahedron and octahedron, tessellate as a pair, and their *Contribution*/form, the the 3<sup>rd</sup> shape of the cube, also tessellates all by itself.  These 2 tessellating forms are the only tessellating shapes of all 75 uniform polyhedra[^459].

[^459]: “**List of Uniform Polyhedra.**” Wikipedia.  Wikimedia Foundation, August 28, 2022.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_uniform_polyhedra. 

We migth conclude from all this that it is the cube that best describes the form of reality, which would be a pretty safe claim considering as we live in a 3D reality.  However, we migth also then conclude that it is the tetrahedron that describes ideas, archetypes and concepts, and the octahedron that describes the limitations of context.

For practical purposes, one perspective we can better understand is to look at the *real* tholons and ignore the *virtual* tholons.  While *virtual* tholons are just as significant, they are also far more complex, and, for the most part, we will avoid delving into them.  This being the case, it is more effective to deal with the structures of *real* tholons, which are identical to a 3D Sierpinski fractal.  Below are 5 different views of a 6-level (iterations) thologram.  As shown above, the most basic pattern is that of a tetrahedron made of an infinite number of iterations on top of an infinite number of generations, within which there are infinite patterns.  The Sierpinski pattern is the most fundamental of all patterns as it is composed of only the most basic of all forms, making it a very stable pattern that will define how energy moves and, therefore, a pattern we expect to see many instances of in reality.

### What *&pi;*, 2, 5, and *e* in common

This topic probably qualifies as an appendix; however, it’s too significant not to place front-and-center, as it is fundamental later in the book when we consider where all universal knowledge is stored and how to access it.

A fascinating pattern in the thologram shows not only that of &pi;, 3.1415924, but also the transcendental part of &pi;, or 0.1415924.  This value is the part left over when you take 3 perfect trigrams and curve their outer edges to form a half circle (shown below).  Because a curved line is an infinite number of points, as opposed to a straight line, which is 2 points, the transcendental part of **&pi;** represents the difference between the archetype of a singular instance of the simplest and most balanced form that can exist and the archetype of the form that is created by an infinite number of trigrams.  The same applies to that of a tetrahedron and a sphere, the most common form in the Universe, but as spheres are 3D, the difference is &pi;<sup>2</sup>.  

Interestingly, when we square the transcendental part, (&pi;-3)<sup>2</sup>, we get the value 0.02004847955, which is 5/10,000<sup>ths</sup> off from 2/100.   As $\sqrt{\frac{2}{100}}$ = 0.14142135623, we can approximate &pi; with $3+\sqrt{\frac{2}{100}}$ or, if we just use prime numbers, $3+\sqrt{\frac{2}{2^2\times 5^2}}$.  This approximation is off by 0.00017 (0.00546%), which is far better than the traditional approximation of $\frac{22}{7}$, which is off by 0.003 (0.04%), but not as good as $\frac{333}{106}$, which is only off by 0.0026%.   

(*Apologies to math purists, but as there is no symbol for the transcendental part of **&pi;**, we’ll be using the capital omega character, **&Omega;**, a catch-all symbol for the “end”, to represent that value, and also the small omega character, **&omega;**, to represent the component values derived from the fractions that lead to **&Omega;** .*)

There have been, and are, many creative interpretations of &pi;; books have been written on its mystical properties, calendars have been created based on &pi;, and &pi; even has its day, March 14 (3/14, obviously), that is celebrated globally (usually involving some actual pie) and is even sanctioned by the U.S.  Congress and UNESCO.  If you appreciate cosmic coincidences, Albert Einstein was born on Pi Day, 1879 (as well as famous porn star Sasha Gray, 1988).   In this case, &Omega; represents the infinite part of &pi;, and 3 represents the finite part&hellip; nothing too mystical or philosophical there, but it is curious that &pi; starts with a finite value (3) and ends with an infinite value(&Omega;).

In example ***a)***, if we alternately subtract and add the inverse of the number of tholons for each row (1, 3, 5, 7, 9,&hellip;) and multiply the result by the number of sides (4), we end up with 3.141592, which is the value of **&pi;**.  Leibniz originally discovered this pattern which is appropriately called the *Leibniz formula for pi*.

In example ***b)***, we use the same formula as ***a)***, but with swapped numerator values of 1 and 4.  Why? Because 1 as a numerator (in ***a)*** describes the unity of a tholon with 4 contexts (sides).  This is the perspective of a *holon* with its 4 contributing *partons*.  In ***b)***, the 4 describes each contributing element to the tholon, i.e., the perspective of the *partons* relationship to the *holon*.  In the context of ***a)***, **&pi;** represents the *holon*, which, being tetrahedral, is a tholon.  As a complete tholon requires 2 tholons, it would be represented as **2&pi;**, and, in fact, **2&pi;** radians is a complete circle and represents the defining or limiting context for its *partons*.  

From a geometry perspective, if we look at the basic 2D map of a tholonic matrix, we can see that it is a 2D trigram as well as the makings of a 3D tetrahedron as 4 trigrams so that we can consider this in both perspectives; each individual trigram as one side of an existing tetrahedron, or as four trigrams that join together to form a potential tetrahedron.  Example ***a)*** considers one side to an existing tetrahedron.  The formula counts the tholons by the rows of the entire trigrams (as a side), then has to multiply by 4, the total number of sides needed for a tetrahedron, to get **&pi;**.  With this formula, each of the 4 sides contributes 1/4 of the solution, which we would expect as we are looking at only 1/4 of the tetrahedron.  Example ***b)*** considers the tholon as one whole made of 4 sides and therefore need only multiply by 1, and in this way, it arrives at **&Omega;**.  

So what is this suggesting?  That the instantiation of &pi;, which never ends, begins with the first instance of the primal archetype of the original 0-dimensional dot of A&I when that 0-dimensional dot became two to form both the concept of a line and the 1<sup>st</sup> dimension.  We will see this again in the next chapter when we explore the tholon’s relationship with Euler’s *God Formula*, <IMG src='../Images/math/345.svg' style='vertical-align:middle;height:12pt'/>*+1=0*, the “most elegant formula in math”. 

***Note: The following is a more detailed (and somewhat circuitous) description for those who enjoy math and numbers but is not necessary for the overall understanding of the thologram.***  JWFIX

If you were asked what pair of numbers, when added together, make 4, you’d probably say 2+2 or 1+3.  You would probably not say &#8730;10.6933136688+0.90038532821<sup>3</sup> because, even though it is correct, it makes no sense, adds no useful information, and requires a lot of work to provide.  You would naturally provide an answer that was easiest to arrive at, easy to comprehend, and has a chance of being useful information.  This might sound like common sense, but only because it is common to do things that are more efficient, practical, and useful than inefficient, impractical, and useless.  But why do we even care about that in the first place? The answer is that any movement of energy always travels the path of least resistance.  Thinking requires work, and ideas and concepts require work to be maintained.  This is common knowledge, but we tend to only apply the concepts of energy in a thermodynamic or electrical context.  The instance of the laws of energy outside of those contexts can be found in anything and everything that is the result of energy, which is every context possible.  

The movement of energy is the balancing of an imbalance.  The first law of energy is that it will always move toward balance.  Thought is energy.  Ideas are energy.  Concepts are energy.   How, then, does this law of balance manifest in ideas, thoughts, and concepts?  First, we need to ask how ideas, thoughts, and concepts came to exist in the first place.  The traditional view is that our meta-awareness results from our evolved neurology.  While that is true, the tholonic view is that our neurology is an effect, not the cause.  What is the cause?  The movement of energy, which forms patterns, which become partons of yet more complex systems, living systems.  If the Universe, and everything in it, is the result of a  0-dimensional concept whose only attributes are A&I, then not only are all things that exist instances of, and have the qualities of, A&I, but the expression of A&I is the very reason for their existence and the driving force behind evolution, growth, and direction.

For us humans who have managed to evolve a *ventrolateral frontal cortex*, we have been able to discover and invent the miraculous tools of thought, ideas, and concepts, which has brought humanity to a new level of discovery and creation.  Of all these advanced tools we have managed to evolve, the great under-sung hero, and by far the most powerful is that of curiosity.  All creatures may be curious to a degree, but humans stand alone in their ability and capacity to ask “why?” and “how? and then find an answer.  Curiosity is the most powerful driving force for the self-aware being, more potent than even the need to survive, as curiosity has been the end of many an explorer.

Why is there a $1,000,000 reward for finding the solution to *a<sup>x</sup> + b<sup>x</sup> = c<sup>x</sup>*? Why do we ask “What if?” or the proverbial question, “What happens when I press *this* button?” Why have we spent years, effort, and money to discover ever-larger prime numbers (currently at 2<sup>82,589,933</sup> -1, a number that has 24,862,048 digits)?  What drives us to calculate &pi; to the 2,000,000,000,000,000<sup>th</sup> place?  *Curiosity*.  This may sound overly simple, but there is nothing simple about curiosity.  Curiosity is hardwired into our being.  It makes the brain more efficient, expands our options, and leads towards the unachievable balance between the 3 states of knowledge; *what we know*,  *what we know we don’t know,* and *what we don’t know we don’t know*.  Our brain rewards us in the form of dopamine when we have learned something, found an answer to a question, or solved a problem, especially when the motivation is internal rather than external, learning for the sake of learning vs.  learning to pass an exam.  The degree to which our aggressively unnatural modern society has altered and/or manipulated these evolutionary circuits is a conversation worth having but is not relevant to the point that all life, being an expression of energy, will replicate the patterns of energy across all contexts.  Curiosity is not born of a human or animal trait; it is the movement of energy in the realm of archetypes, and as we explore the world of abstract thought, we become the conduits for that energy.  Curiosity is an instance of the energy moving through the circuits of life in the context of a self-aware mind.  It is that same energy moving through every context, making all that exists active elements in a living circuit.

“Knowledge is light, ignorance is darkness” is a very common phrase and metaphor, but why do we naturally equate light with knowledge and that which is “good”? Perhaps it is because we know at the cellular level, and after 4 billion years of evolution, that light is life.  Although less poetic, it would be more accurate to say, “Energy is life”, given what we have learned about light and energy.  Still, as we only discovered this fact a little while ago, starting with the works of Isaac Newton, and taking another leap with the works of Albert Einstein, I assume that the phrase predates those giants by millennia in one form or another.   We could go further and say, “Energy is existence”, and if energy is existence, then existence, i.e., all that is; life, planets, plants, aliens, etc., is not only subject to the rules of energy but is *formed* by the rules of energy.

If the above is true, we should be able to identify the fundamental laws of energy, such as entropy, resistance, potential, charge, etc., in any context.  One obvious example is heat.  It is one instance of energy that is the same for all contexts and things, as there is nothing in this Universe that has no heat, even the empty void of deep space.

So how does this apply in the context of concepts or numbers?  Let’s take the concept of entropy.  Entropy is defined as a value of the amount of energy that escapes a system and is proportional to the number of *microstates* available.  The number of *microstates* is defined as *“the number of ways system components can be arranged without changing its energy”*.  In other words, the higher number of microstates, the more ways energy can dissipate and the higher the entropy.  Can this concept apply to other types of energy, such as the energy of the concept of numbers? Using the same definitions, we can then say the entropy of a number is “*the number of ways a value’s components can be arranged without changing its value*”.  For example, when dealing with only natural numbers (excluding 0), the value of 3 can be “arranged” as 1+1+1 *and* 2+1, which would be the equivalent of 2 microstates.  The chart below shows the “microstates” for the numbers 1-10 using only prime numbers (the inset is only meant to make the patterns more pronounced).  

<center><img src='../Images/num_entropy.png' style='width:100%'></center>

There are 23 ways (or “microstates”) to make the value of 10 using unique combinations of prime numbers, starting with 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1, which requires the least amount of “work”, ending with 3+7, which requires the most amount of “work”.

Besides this form of numeric constructions being the same process used by the Pythagoreans when analyzing the properties of a number, the reasoning behind how these number towers are formed is straightforward; create each “microstate” starting with the “simplest”, “least resistance”  or “lowest entropy” numbers, and keep adding until you get to the final value.  In the example above, we only use prime numbers, but the same process works when using all numbers or when using only single instances of numbers.  It’s debatable which is more ‘accurate’.  As this is mainly a conceptual exercise to demonstrate that we can apply energy concepts to numbers, it may not matter.  However, the sort order shows an interesting fractal pattern of trigrams, each representing a new level or value.  The order is defined by 3 simple rules meant to emulate the natural world: 1) The smallest numbers must first be used (from left to right). 2) When all possible combinations are exhausted, a new number will be created using the least amount of “work” possible. 3) Only numbers that have already been created can be used.  

Using the unique prime number arrangements (like above, but only using any number once in a set), the chart below shows the 53,041 possible configurations that can produce the number 300.  We won’t get into the details of the graphs, but there are two points worth a closer look: the persistent presence of both trigram relationships and patterns (left) and binary expansion (right).  The most interesting regarding the binary expansions is that the first 7 or 8 layers show a clear and consistent binary pattern.  The next 7 or 8 rows begin to show changes emerging.  Beyond that, we begin to see the beginning of the fractal nature of these “microstates” with patterns and colors replicating and flipping every *2<sup>n</sup>* columns becoming more and more chaotic, like leaves of grass flowing in the breeze. 

*Note: In both charts, the colors follow the spectrum from dark-red to fuchsia (bright violet), with dark-red presenting the lowest number in a set that sums to 300 and fuchsia representing the largest number in that same set.  Each dot also has a depth, creating a Z-axis which is not shown that looks similar to the vertical/Y-axis*

<center><img src='../Images/prime_stripes.png' style='width:100%'></center>

Applying the concept of microstates to numbers suggests that large numbers “dissipate” faster than small numbers.  In one way, this is true, as the dissipation of energy is actually the energy balancing itself out by distributing itself evenly across its environment via the microstates.  The number 2 can be distributed only as 1+1, but 300 can be distributed in 53,041 ways.  How many ways can the number 12,345,678 be distributed?  We can’t know that answer without counting every possibility as there is no way (I believe) to predict this value as it depends on when prime numbers appear, which are themselves unpredictable.  Technically speaking, 1 can’t have a microstate because, by definition, 1 is *unity*; it has no sup-parts because it was created from nothing, 0.  Therefore, 1 can only have a *macrostate*, and that *must* be the only *macrostate* that can exist.

A more concrete example of applying entropy to numbers is that of water pipes.  The larger the pipe, the lower the entropy.  A water pipe with 0 entropy, or 0 resistance, would have to be as large as theoretically possible.  This would equate to the number 1, or the singular 0-dimensional dot of A&I, or the entropy of the Universe at the moment of the Big Bang (which was actually 10<sup>88</sup> k<sub>B</sub>, so, while not 0, it was the lowest amount of entropy that will ever exist, as that value today is 10<sup>103</sup> k<sub>B</sub> and will continue to grow over the next 10<sup>20</sup> years until it maxes out at 10<sup>123</sup> k<sub>B</sub>).  The first finite water pipe, or the first instance of resistance or limitation, would be equivalent to the value of 2.  We can see this concept in how all numbers are divisible by 1, but only half are divisible by 2.  More resistance gives us 3, which $\frac{1}{3}$ of all numbers are divisible by, etc.   In this water example, the “size” of the water line is the inverse of the value.  So, a water pipe of 1, where 1 represents the *unity* of all that exists, means that the water pipe is as big as *unity*, as *unity*&div;*1=unity*.  A pipe as large as *unity*&div;2 is half the size, etc. 

Just like water and electricity, if we double the resistance (or make the pipe half the size), we get half the current (or half the water), so as far as efficiency is concerned, two 2s are identical to one 4&hellip; at least this was the reasoning behind using only prime numbers.

The value of 1 alone has 0 microstates, and as such, its energy can’t move anywhere *within itself* and therefore has 0 entropy.  We know from classic entropy that this suggests maximum pressure, maximum order, and maximum impetus.  As there is nowhere for 1 to expand to *within itself*, the “energy”, which *must* move, is forced to create a new state or value *outside of itself* that requires the least amount of “work”.  This would be the value of 2.  The value of 2 has one microstate and therefore has higher entropy, slightly less pressure, and order and represents a more balanced, distributed condition of the “energy” of 1.

<img src='../Images/matter_0017.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>We see this same type of expansion in simple math when we have to create a new “place” when we add 1 to 9 to get 10, and we also see it in electrons when they get energized and jump to their next higher orbit of the 7 orbits that exist in every atom (image right).  This is also the source of all light because when the electrons drop from a higher orbit to a lower orbit, they emit the excess energy that is no longer needed to maintain that higher energy state as a photon of electromagnetic energy (of course, the reality of these orbits and states is quite a bit more complex than the image suggests).   

We took the long way to get to the point where we can demonstrate that binary counting is the most efficient way to count and that counting naturally occurs in the movement of energy.  OK, maybe not the most efficient way for humans, but the context of humans is quite different and far more restricted than that of the Universe.  Surprisingly, no culture used binary counting until 1963, when IBM came up with the idea to use it for computers.  The one exception to this is the binary-based, metaphysical Taoist writing titled the “I Ching” (“Book of Changes”), which dates back to ancient times.  Still, this material was not considered practical or valuable (by Western culture) and was relegated to mysticism and lore.

*Note: To avoid confusion between the bases, binary numbers are preceded with a “**b**”.*

The binary system of numbers is not only the most efficient, but it is the only counting system that contains the most efficient recipes for creating any value.  For example, let’s say we have a result of some addition that equals 10.  We could have arrived at that value by adding 4+6, or 9+1, etc.  However, in the binary system, the value of 10 is represented as *b*1010, so we automatically know that the most efficient way to create 10 is by adding *b*1000 (8) and *b*10 (2).  Any other combination of values would require more “work”.  Here are all the possible combinations of creating 10 with pairs of numbers.  They are listed in ascending order of “work” required.  As we would expect, the most efficient formula is that which is based on 2, as in 2<sup>1</sup>+2<sup>4</sup>.

<img src='../Images/10orders.png' style='float:left;height:60px'>

<div style='clear: both;'></div>
Consider the binary number *b*11010011 (211).  How long would it take to discover the most efficient numbers that sum to this?  In binary, the number itself shows us the answer.  Using any other base is considerably more “work”, as shown in the image below, and we know this because 2 is the first (pure) primary number and, therefore, the first root of all following numbers (in the binary system).  Were there a more efficient system other than *something* and *nothing*, that would be the system reality would be based on because that would be the way energy moves.  

<center><img src='../Images/bases.png' style='width:100%'></center>

<img src='../Images/3groups.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>We can easily divide all numbers into 2 groups of odd and even.  How do we create 3 equal groups for all numbers? This is done in the thologram (and explained in the *Appendix C, “Tholonic Math: Prime Numbers”*), and those groups are:

- All numbers divisible by 3 (33.3333&hellip;%)
- All numbers divisible by 2 exclusively, i.e., excluding the previous numbers divisible by 3 (33.335%)
- All prime numbers and products of primes numbers, excluding the previous prime numbers of 2 and 3 (33.3317%)

We now have 3 groups of equal size that can describe every number’s type, and by assigning each group to a side of the tholon, we can see some fascinating patterns (see appendix). 

In the same way, for the values 0-7, we can assign a 0 or a 1 to each of the 3 sides to describe each value with the 3 sides of the tetrahedron (shown below for numbers 0-7).  We can only use the values 0-7 as they are the only values that require only 3 places

<center><img src='../Images/bin2dec.png' style='width:70%'></center>

So, using the sides of a tholon only, we can hold 8 values (the center trigram of the tholon holds the total value).  This organically makes the tholon a base-8, or *octal*, number system, which is the same base used in all digital processing.

<center><img src='../Images/TRIBIN.png' style='width:70%'></center>

*Note: To avoid confusion between the bases, octal numbers greater than 7 are preceded with an “**o**”*

That’s fine for 0-7, but what about larger numbers?  What about the number 8? As this is octal, there is no 8, per se, as 7 is the largest single value that exists, so 8 in octal is written as *o*10, which is the same as *o*010 which is the same as *b*1010.  We can’t fit 4 values to 3 sides, but we can refer to the parent tholon representing *b*111, which is 7.  Below is the same chart as above but using octal numbers instead of binary.

<center><img src='../Images/TRIBINoct.png' style='width:100%'></center>

How, then, do we notate *o*10?  As we already have a 7, which is a parent tholon, we only need to add a child tholon that has a value of 1, as shown in the left-most image below:

<center><img src='../Images/TRIBIN10.png' style='width:70%'></center>

The center image above shows the same technique for 14 (7+7) and the right image for 17.

As you can see, this is not a very human-friendly way to count, especially when we get to numbers like 300,000,000.  We’d have to start with a trigram that stretched from Istanbul to New York City to be able to read the last trigram.  Fortunately, the point of this is not to introduce a terrible way to add (although if the Department of Education wants to give me billions of dollars to develop their *NEW New Math* program, please get in touch with me), but to show the fractal nature of numbers.  It also shows how numbers act like energy in the same way we demonstrated above with the number towers because a trigram must be filled before a new trigram is added.  Finally, it shows that, at least tholonically, there is an optimum set of *parton* numbers that creates a *holon* value; 7+7+3 = 17 is more optimal than 2+3+5+7, and in the tholonic system, it would not even be possible to notate that because the tholonic system organically only permits the most optimum set.

Further on, we will see how this same tholonic process is why cells and organs come together optimally.

You probably already know, or figured out, that using base-2 numbers limited to 3 places results in a base-8 system because 2<sup>3</sup>= 8, but the less obvious implication is that the sides of the tholon can act exponentially to whatever is applied to them.

Just for fun, here is what the same process above looks like if we start at the center, move outward, and then change the trigrams to circles.

<center><img src='../Images/TRIBINprime2.png' style='width:100%'></center>

An interesting example of how the same patterns appear across different scopes is how the *xyz* coordinates of the tetrahedron, cube, and octahedron relate to these binary values.  For example, in the image below, we can see that the simplest *xyz* coordinates for each shape have a pattern, which is then expressed in 1s and 0s.  If we interpret those 1s and 0s as binary values, we can convert them to a decimal value and then map that value to the 3D location of a point.  

<center><img src='../Images/coordsbindec.png' style='width:100%'></center>
*Note: Negative values are in red, odd values in blue, and even values in green. 0 is yellow, as it has both odd and even qualities.*

There are several interesting relationships, but especially interesting is the octahedron because, to ensure all the coordinates are integers, we have to use 2 as the dimensions of the sides, unlike how we have to use 1 for the other shapes.  JWFIX[is this relevant?]This is relevant because if we accept the tetrahedron and octahedron represent the polarity between somethingness and nothingness, then this shows the 1<sup>st</sup> polarity is that of 1 and 2, which is clear and simple, and simple is always preferred.  In the other forms, we only have the *xyz* values of 1 and -1, easily converted to 1 and 0.  Still, the octagon has 3 values, 0, 2, and -2, resulting in a positive and negative pair of values (1,-1), (2,-2), and (4,-4), so we apply the negative values to 7 with gives us 6, 5, and 3.

What this also shows us is that each point has a qualitative value and order, which tells us there is a direction, which looks like this, respectfully:

<center><img src='../Images/coordsbindec_lines-red.png' style='width:100%'></center>

The *Paths* represent the *closed form* we get when we connect the vertices in their binary order.  1 can only connect to 2, 2 to 3, etc.  It is a *closed path*, or *closed form*, because when we get to the last point, we connect it to the 1<sup>st</sup> point (indicated in red).  An *open path* occupies 3D space but is itself only 1 dimensional and cannot define a 2D or 3D form.   Columns 2 and 4 show closed forms.  Columns 3 and 5 show these closed forms after that have been transformed via *bi-cubic uniform B-splines* (*Catmull-Clark* algorithm, specifically), which is intended to show the most probable flow of energy, using the vertices of the original forms as control points.  Whether or not this is the most accurate way may be debatable, but regardless, we see some fascinating patterns, such as in Column 5.  Also interesting is how in *Col 2/3*, we see the tetrahedron produces 1 “saw-tooth” form of a cycle, the octagon produces 2 cycles, and the cube produces 3 cycles.  All these images are orthogonal projections of 3D shapes onto 2D space, so these cycles are not actually cycles but just appear as cycles.  However, the same could also be said about our 3D cycles of light, energy, sound, etc., if we consider them as 3D projections of a multidimensional source.

Column 6 shows a colored 3D version of the original form when the vertices are connected in their binary order and can be considered archetypes of the 3D forms in *Column 1* because the binary paths are simpler than the 3D shapes they create.  It’s worth pointing out that Col 6/tetrahedral is a  *hyperbolic paraboloid*, which most of us know as the shape of a Pringles potato chip.  The Pringles shape (and the canister to hold them) was designed by Fredric Baur, an organic chemist and food storage scientist who was keenly aware of the hyperbolic paraboloid’s remarkable durability.  This shape is familiar in architecture for the same reason, especially in the military and for roofing.  So, the next time you get to the bottom of a Pringles can and the last chip is still intact, you can thank the tetrahedron.

## And this finally brings us back to &hellip;

With all that said, let’s return now to the tholonic formulas for &pi;, which are based on the Leibniz model for &pi;.  This model provides a way to measure the difference between each generation of tholons.  While Leibniz used odd numbers, the tholonic perspective is to consider the generations of tholons because the thologram is a model of creation, growth, and the movement of energy from an originating point (the parent tholon) to a destination point (the child tholon).  <img src='../Images/family-3.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>As such, we are using the size of each sequential pair of parent and children, or *family* of tholons, i.e., 1 tholon generates 2 (*real*) child tholons, hence, a *family* of 3.  These 2 child tholons generate 3 children for a *family* of 5 (*real*) tholons, etc.  The quantitative values are the same in both equations, but the qualitative values are radically different.  For the record, while we are calling them a *family*, technically, they are more like siblings as they were all created in the same generation and by the same parent.  Still, there is a natural hierarchy within this generation simply by their positioning relative to one another.

<img src='../Images/tcurve.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>In applying formula ***b)*** we begin with ***4&div;family-size*** for the first tholon, so we have ***4&div;1***, or simply ***4***.  The next value, with a *family-size* of 3, would then be ***4&div;3***, or ***1.333***, the next *family-size* of ***5*** is then ***(4&div;5),*** or ***0.8***, etc.  Then we combine millions of these values, ***4 - 1.333 + 0.8 -***&hellip;, to arrive at **&Omega;**.  Not surprisingly, this series of values creates a pattern of a *damped harmonic oscillator* (top, image right), an oscillation that gets reduced due to energy being drained from a system.  Of course, in this case (and all cases), the energy is not being “drained” but rather distributed.  This progression goes on forever, with ever-decreasing amplitude.  

What jumps out are the perfect, or exact, values for **ω** that only appear for *family-sizes* that are 5-based (image right, in yellow), and the fact that these values are progressing in binary order; 8, 16, 32, 64, &hellip; or 2<sup>3</sup>, 2<sup>4</sup>, 2<sup>5</sup>&hellip; but at the same time is divided by 10 (or in terms of prime numbers, 2&times;5) at each level, as they appear as 0.8, 0.16, 0.0032.  While reality is often fuzzy, measured in degrees of truth, these binary values are absolutely exact, and they are the only exact values that appear.  It’s also interesting that in this example, the growth of the thologram results in smaller and smaller values, just like the size of the tholon gets smaller and smaller in the binary counting example&hellip; which I guess is what we would expect if the thologram was internally expanding, but I wonder if there is a correlation.

In this example, the mathematical reason for this is that 1 can only be divided by numbers created by 2 and 5 (i.e., 2, 4, 5, 8) to produce an exact value.  Still, as our *family-size* will always be an odd number, only numbers created by 5 will produce exact values.  The more curious result is their continuous shrinking by a factor of 10 at each occurrence.  To be clear, the very same thing happens with the other values, the difference being that only 5-based values produce an exact rational number.  These 5-based values also integrate the base-2 binary and base-10 number systems perfectly. 

<center><img src='../Images/cals.png' style='width:100%'></center>

On closer examination, we discover the relationship between 2 and 5 is very close and can be seen in their simple relationships $\frac{1}{5}=0.2$, $\frac{1}{2}=0.5$, $\frac{2}{5}=0.4$ or $\frac{1}{5}\times(2\times5)$, $\frac{5}{2}=2.5$, plus the more elaborate $\frac{2\times 5+\frac{2}{5}}{2}=5.2$. 5 and 2 just can’t get enough of each other, and given that 5 just happens to be $\frac{1}{2}$ of 10, which is the base of our number system, this 2/5 relationship is even more apparent.

There are solid arguments why base-12 or base-8 is superior to base-10, so why do we use base-10?  The common argument is because that was the base system that was in common use when the Indians/Arabs introduced the popular place-holding system, and base-10 is presumed to have originated from our having 5 fingers, just as the Mayan base-20 comes from fingers and toes (making counting a form of exercise, I would imagine), and the base-8 of the Yuki tribe from California from counting the spaces between their fingers.  Although, for many, 10 was a sacred number, which we can see in the divine languages Arabic, Hebrew, and Sanskrit, all of which were heavily biased toward base-10.  “Divine” refers to the belief that these languages were believed to be delivered by God.  Sanskrit, called the “Language of the Gods”, is said to have been created by God before he created the Universe.  Hebrew comes from the Torah, which is said to be “given by God” and “was made of an integument of white fire, the engraved letters were in black fire, and it was itself of fire and mixed with fire, hewn out of fire, and given from the midst of fire”[^400].  Arabic is said to be the language God revealed in the final revelation of the Quran.  What is important here is not whether they were of divine origin but that the people believed they were.  

In addition to the base-10 bias, the number 10 had specific significance, for example, the 10 commandments, 10 plagues, Jesus’ use of 10 in many parables, 10% tithing, etc.  In the Hindu *Vedas*, which date back 7,000 years, the numbers 1, 3, 7, and 10 are most used and are considered the most sacred of numbers, with 10 also being symbolic of “many” and “fullness” and is (perhaps) why the Rig Veda (ancient Indian collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns) is 10 volumes[^401].  In the Islamic Hadith, Mohammad states that good deeds are returned 10-fold.  These are just some of the many examples of the significance of 10 that came from the dominant and unquestionable cultural influence at the time when modern math was being invented.

For this reason alone, we would expect the Hindu-Arabic and Judeo-Christian number systems to be base-10 because that is what their respective gods gave them.  Even if a better number system existed, no one was keen on committing heresy by pointing that out.  We can easily imagine how base-10 counting made its way into these sacred texts if we presume that their origins, although perhaps divinely inspired, were written by men with 5 fingers on 2 hands. 

<img src='../Images/25pair.png' style='float:right;width:30%'>However, the tholonic view is that we have 5 fingers and 2 hands because the 2/5 relationship defines a fundamental pattern in nature.  This is common among most species of mammals and exists in many birds, fish, and insects, going back to the ancestor of all mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and birds, the *pentadactyl tetrapods* of the Devonian Age 400,000,000 years ago (*pentadactyl* mean “having 5 fingers”, and *tetrapod* mean “four-limbed vertebrate animals”).  This is solid evidence that this 2/5 relationship is a very efficient pattern; otherwise, evolution would not have stuck with it for 400,000,000 years, at least where tetrapods are concerned.  It would be natural, then, that we would use a base-10 system.  But why 2 and 5?  Because they are the values, the forms of energy, that are both in the domain of *Contribution/form*, i.e., interaction and integration with the environment, and both values represent the opposing sides of the same axis, as 5 is the “complement”, and in a way, the “opposite” of 2.  This is because the 1<sup>st</sup> generation of 2, i.e., the 1<sup>st</sup> “child” of 2, is 5, just as the child of 1 is 4, and most telling, the child of 0 is 3.  In the thologram, 0, 1, and 2 are points, and their children of 3, 4, and 5 (each child is always +3 of the parent.), are lines, and *their* children are points, and so on.  The natural pairing becomes that of parent and child or a point and a line.  

This may sound like “numerology” or some other form of irrational symbolism and superstition, but it is based on the movement of energy, which we claim numbers represent as they must follow the same laws of energy.  As for the 5-finger phenomena, the traditional explanation from the Leading experts in the field of human anatomy, developmental biology, and evolution goes something like this:

> “… we simply don’t 100% know the ‘why’ or ‘how’ of the narrowing of hand morphology to five digit rays in the Devonian.  [Any hypothesis] would be highly speculative without a lot of data on the types of selective pressures organisms at the time were facing… [^348] 

The tholonic explanation provides a very “real” answer, and by applying the rule of science, which says “something is real when it is a necessary ingredient of a theory that correctly describes what we observe”, these qualitative powers of numbers are as “real” as the never-actually-seen black holes and quarks.

Interestingly, we see a similar pattern of the *Contributing* 2/5 pair in the other *Defining* pair of 1/4:

$\frac{2}{5}$= 0.4 and $\frac{5}{2}$ = 02.5 *Contributing* pole

$\frac{4}{1}$ = 4.0 and $\frac{1}{4}$ = 0.25 *Defining* pole

This suggests that the spectrum where new N-states appear can be seen as an octave or a magnitude of difference between the poles, as the *Contributing* 0.4 is one octave higher than the *Defining* 4.0 whose 0.25 is an octave lower than the *Contributing* 2.5.  This creates an octave of the size of 3.75, or (3&times;4)+$\frac{3}{4}$, or perhaps more relevant, 15 parts of $\frac{1}{4}$ or $\frac{15}{4}$.  Equally interesting is how the 1<sup>st</sup> N-state = 0 (i.e., $\frac{0}{3}$), but the 2<sup>nd</sup> N-state = 0.5 (i.e., $\frac{3}{6}$), right smack in the middle of the *nothingness* and *somethingness* of 0 and 1, which is what we would expect as the 1<sup>st</sup> trigram only defines the boundaries of the children and is not itself a child.  The children, which are the tholons that instantiate and exist *within* the 1<sup>st</sup> tholon, only begin *after* the first trigram.

The natural number system in the thologram appears to be binary, so binary math and binary logic are probably the most applicable for tholonic calculations.  If all creation exists within the thologram, and the thologram is binary in nature, then this might lead to some insights into the “reality is a simulation” hypothesis.
