This index is divided into 6 categories:
- **Archetypes**; a perfect or ideal structure of an instance.
- **Energy**; movement, heat, force, power, awareness, intention.
- **Instances**; how archetypes are expressed in tour material reality.
- **Models**; theories, beliefs, perspectives of understanding.
- **Order**; patterns in chaos.
- **People**; real or legendary folks that have contributed to our knowledge.

These categories are based on the following premise:

Everything is **energy**, and the movement of energy forms patterns, or **archetypes**, which **instantiate** as form.  By observing these forms, **people** create **models** to understand the **order**.
