# Part IV
~~Part I of this book introduces the ideas and concepts that form the vocabulary later used to describe the tholonic model presented.  These are not esoteric or niche concepts, but the most fundamental concepts known to science, such as energy, chaos, order, waves, and Newton’s laws.  As we review these basic concepts, we also expand on them and build new concepts that will be critical in describing what role awareness plays in the theater of existence, how and why consciousness *had* to evolve, and the nature of intelligence; artificial, human, or otherwise.~~

## Writing Style

For those readers who are sticklers about writing style conventions in the U.S., I have deliberately chosen to place punctuation (that is not part of a quote) outside of quotes.  The convention of placing punctuation inside the quotes was adopted due to the limitations of fixed width fonts in the pre-digital age.  The British convention has punctuation outside of quotes, but that is because they use single quotes, not double quotes.  To quote William Strunk and E. B. White, “Typographical usage dictates the comma be inside the marks, though logically it seems not to belong there”.  I agree, and take the side of Canadian poet, typographer and author Robert Bringhurst who bravely stated that it “makes no *typographic* difference” if quotation marks “follow commas and periods or precede them”. 

This book also follow periods with two spaces, not one.  The two-space rule was also in place due to fixed width fonts, but unlike the punctuation-quotes rules, it has fierce opposition with both sides claiming victory. Even the American Psychological Association has gone from officially recommending one space, then recommending one *or* two spaces, then back to two spaces (in their 6th addition), then back to one space (7th edition). This does not inspire confidence in their craft. I will be using two spaces because it has been shown that using two spaces after a period increases text processing ability[^1].  

While it is customary to spell out numbers in a sentence, for the most part, numbers in a sentence will be shown as numerals when they refer to a quantity, e.g. “There is 1 apple” vs. “Alone with one’s thoughts”. This is to allow for quantitative numerical values to be easily recognizable, which, like the above point, increases text processing ability.  This style also avoids the inconsistent and differing rules of when it is proper to spell out numbers, such as; any number less the 10, 13, 100, always at the beginning of a sentence, never a date, day, time, decimals, money, in titles, percentage, etc., etc.  The general rule in writing is “when in doubt, spell it out”, but there is no doubt with the rule “If it’s a unit of measure in any dimension (time, value, length, quantity, ratio, etc.) it’s a numeral”.

When is comes to the capitalization of the names of celestial objects, which is still a very unsettled debate, this book follows the recommendation of the American Physical Society (APS) and capitalizes all non-generic references, for example, “Our Universe, Sun, and Moon are an instance of many universes, suns, and moons”.

## Low-Tech Issues

<img src="../Images/colorwheelchart.png" style="float:right;width:50%;"/>My apologies for the sometimes crude layout of the book in general. Once-upon-a-time I was myself a young typographer back in the days when the job often included the re-melting of lead “pigs” that were used to set the type using the Linotype machines of the day. Today, that drudgery has been replaced with endlessly tweaking semi-compatible markup languages such as Markdown, LaTex, PDF, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (I was much better at melting “pigs”).

One of the challenges in writing this book was how to get color images to appear meaningful in black and white e-book readers.  In some cases it was not possible, especially considering various e-book readers use various schemes to deal with colors.  

To that end, here is a simple color wheel that will show you how your e-reader treats at least the 6 basic colors. The center shows the 6 shades of white to black.

The sad and current state of e-book readers is that most do not support anything but the most basic formatting, and even *that* is often spotty, especially regarding blockquotes and lists, and even more so if the e-reader is older.  Using color is discouraged for e-book publishers, but that is not possible in this book. Feel free to download the latest versions color PDF from https://github.com/tholonia/the_book/blob/main/Latest/THOLONIA_THE_BOOK.pdf.

If you are reading this on a e-book reader, the chances that it will look especially ugly are quite high.  This is because many e-book reader manufacturers take it upon themselves to deliberately eliminate the layout that the author has developed, and replace it with their own generic (and IMHO, hideous) one-size-fits-all format.  The only upside to this that I can imagine is for the manufacturer as it frees them from having to deal with more complex layouts.  Personally, I find this practice offensive to the author and the reader,  not to mention reinforcing the standards of banality.  There are ways around this, but it involves downloading software and installing patches to the ebook reader.
