# Appendix L: The Thologram and <u>Metaphysics</u>

###### Inner workings of <u>Awareness</u> and <u>Intention</u>

The concept of “religion” or “divinity” may not overlap with “metaphysics” for many people, but it that topic is place here merely for convenience.

## <u>Tholonic</u> Divinity

The <u>tholonic</u> claim is that our <u>understanding</u> of <u>reality</u> is determined by the context of our <u>understanding</u> the universally consistent <u>laws</u>, and because of this, we will see the same <u>patterns</u> through these different <u>cultural</u> lenses.  

Prior to modern <u>science</u>, it was <u>religion</u> that provided that lens, and over thousands of years inspired and brilliant minds studied and philosophized on the <u>nature</u> of these god-given tenants in an attempt to unveil the mysteries of the <u>God</u>, the <u>Universe</u>, and Life.  

Not surprisingly then, we can see a <u>number</u> of parallels between the ancient <u>understanding</u> of <u>God</u>, the creations of <u>God</u>, and the thologram.

In the traditional and current <u>Christian</u> view of the Judaeo-Christian model (The Jewish model is similar, but not exactly the same) there exists 9 angelic choirs made up of 3 spheres of responsibility with each sphere having 3 classes of angels.

This is remarkably similar to the <u>tholonic</u> model, but limited to a single tholon.

We can even see how the class of angles fits neatly into the <u>tholonic</u> trinity of *Negotiation/Definition/Contribution* (or *Balance/Limitation/Form*):

- *Negotiation/balance* angels are tasked with care-taking, delivering, and manifesting the will of God.
- *Defining/limiting* angels are tasked with guarding, operating, and watching <u>God</u>’s creations.
- *Contributing/form* angels are the wheels, the warriors, and man’s personal guiding angels.

Even more astonishing is that some of the greatest <u>religious</u> philosophers have described this angelic <u>hierarchy</u> in ways that sound perfectly tholonic.  For example, the most respected and influential philosopher and Torah scholar of the Middle Ages, Maimonides (Moses ben Maimon, 1138–1204 CE. Spain), in his book “Guide of the Perplexed”, explains at length how angels are forms of <u>intelligence</u>, and what is referred to an “angels” are not only the forces and <u>laws</u> of <u>nature</u>, but the forces of imagination, <u>ideas</u>, and even the mind of man.  Furthermore, <u>reality</u> as we know it is formed by these invisible intelligences as well as the <u>intelligence</u> of Man.  He supports his arguments with the <u>ideas</u> of <u>Aristotle</u>, <u>Plato</u>, and even the angles themselves as they are portrayed to conclude that:

> Thus the Sages reveal to the aware, that *the imaginative faculty is also called an angel; and the mind is called a cherub*. How beautiful this will appear to the sophisticated mind – and how disturbing to the primitive.”

He doubles-down on his heretical claims by stating t￼hat <u>reality</u> is controlled by the <u>laws</u> of <u>physics</u>, not by <u>God</u>’s will, most miracles never happened, and perhaps his most egregious claim, that divine providence is non-supernatural, is not given by the grace of <u>God</u>, but is achieved by perfection of the intellect&hellip; and this was 800 years ago!

Of course, telling people that angels are anthropomorphized constructs of forms of <u>intelligence</u> and that they were responsible for their own divine providence not go over so well, and his book was quickly condemned and burned by both Jews and Christians.

This was 800 years ago, but going back as far 2000 years we can see the same sentiment  in the <u>Christian</u> Bible:

> Bible: “For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on <u>earth</u>, visible, and invisible… all things have been created through him and for him”. Colossians 1:16-17 

The <u>tholonic</u> view is identical, only related in terms of <u>tholons</u> and energy:

> Tholonic: “All things exist within the thologram, from <u>concepts</u> to forms.  All things come in to <u>existence</u> through the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> for the sole purpose attaining balance.”

I want to make it very clear that this in no way is meant disparage, disrespect, or even criticize <u>religious</u> beliefs.  The <u>tholonic</u> position is all views, beliefs, perspectives are equally valid, and with each perspective comes certain understandings and limitations. The major difference between the <u>tholonic</u> model and the <u>religious</u> model is a <u>duality</u> between nothing and something vs. the <u>duality</u> between good and <u>evil</u> and that there is no “will of <u>God</u>”, there is only <u>Awareness</u> and Intention.  The <u>tholonic</u> view even recognizes an ultimate creator, that being the <u>Awareness</u> and <u>Intention</u> that all <u>energy</u> comes from.  in fact, if you replace the <u>concept</u> of “<u>God</u>” with “<u>energy</u>”, the “will of <u>God</u>” with “<u>tholons</u> <u>intelligence</u> and “divine beings” with “<u>tholons</u>”, there are remarkable similar.

All <u>tholons</u> are expressions of <u>energy</u> and are created by energy.  <u>Tholons</u> are regulated by <u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u>, and all <u>tholons</u> have the ability to creating more tholons. 

The first <u>tholon</u> within which all other are created could be considered as the <u>God</u> <u>Tholon</u>, but that <u>tholon</u> itself was created by <u>Awareness</u> and <u>Intention</u> which has no traits or characteristics other than A&I. Any <u>concept</u> of a <u>god</u> or divine being that has any traits whatsoever, other than A&I, would by definition be a child <u>tholon</u> that has its own <u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u> and therefore has an agenda of some sort as it requires its own child <u>tholons</u> to exist as well as having to co-exist with its peers and in accordance to its parent.

## Personal Experiments

As was briefly alluded to earlier in the reference to the Taoist *Neidan* meditation practice, tholonic concepts exist in ancient mediation as a way to connect with the *inner energy* of the spirit.  This inner energy has many names such as ; spirit, chi, qi, prana.   Tholonically, this *inner energy* is the same energy that we see everyday in the material work, but in a different scope and context, and as this, and all, energy is Awareness and Intention, the scope of this energy in meditation is also awareness and intention, but within the context limits of human consciousness.  We’ll simply refer to this *inner energy*, this instance of A&I in the context of human consciousness, as a&i.

There are many dimensions, techniques, and intentions when to comes to meditation, which can range from sitting to spinning in circles for hours. From a tholonic perspective, we want to look at only the single dimension of how mediation can alter the entropy of this an *inner energy*. 

Mediation techniques of stilling the mind, disconnecting from the outer world, and emptying one’s self completely, are all entropy-lowering techniques.  These meditations reduce the number microstates that the mind can explore, thereby creating a less distributed, more focused mind.  This is equivalent to returning the mind to a state of singularity, which is a state of much lower entropy.  

Meditations that require concentration and focus, such as the meditations of complex mandalas that contain geometric patterns, symbolism, and layers of meaning, are specifically meant to add more microstates for the mind to explore, thereby enhancing the distribution of energy, leading to a more balanced state.  

For example, in Buddhism there are 2 types of meditations;  *Vipassana* (“insight”) and *Samatha* (“tranquility”).

*Vipassana* (“Insight”) is a state in which the mind is singularly focused on is happening as it happens and through the use concentration of awareness, gradually chipping away at the illusion of this temporary material world that separates him eternal truth of reality.  The technique requires attention to mindful listening, seeing, self-reflection, and testing, making it a entropy-increasing practice.  As this involves the dispersion and decoherence of energy, there is a greater demand on the a&i (i.e., energy), but it coheres the mind.  Meditations that involve physical exertion and a heightened awareness of one’s surroundings, such as spinning (e.g., Whirling Dervishes) or even running, which can induce a transcendental state, are Vipassana-ish in nature.



*Samatha* (“tranquility”) is a state in which the mind is brought to rest, focused only on one item, such as a prayer a light, or am image, and not allowed to wander.  This result in a state or rapture which ends when the meditation is over.  Although this is a temporary state, it is beneficial to one’s state of being and has low energy requirements.  This is an entropy-decreasing practice, as it eliminates many microstates that can dissipate one’s awareness, thus increasing the coherence of one’s a&i (i.e., energy).  Meditations that induce trance-like states and *Samatha-ish* in nature.

*Samatha* is the more common form of meditation, among Buddhism and other disciplines as well, but *Vipassana* is the oldest of Buddhist meditations, dating back to the days of Buddha himself (563 to 483 B.C.), and was described in a discourse in the *Satipatthana Sutta* (“Foundations of Mindfulness”) attributed to Buddha.

One path leads to the Beginning and one path leads to the End, which, from a energy perspective, both are 2 views from the same “location”, and achieving one state will usually lead to the other.  

This “the end in the beginning, the beginning is the end” ideas is metaphorically similar to how new Big Bangs (singularities), and the new universe they create, occur within the “nothingness” of black holes (“nothingness” in the sense that no-thing exists in black hole, as as there is nothing or no-one to observe what is in a black hole, then everything is a just a bunch of un-collapsed wave-functions)
