# 12: PREDETERMINISM

###### Free will exists, but its options are limited

Remember the explanation of how a lightning rod works?  It simply creates a path of least <u>resistance</u> between 2 different states that seek <u>balance</u>, and, as <u>energy</u> always travels the path of least <u>resistance</u>, lightning will always seek the lightning rod over a brick chimney.  We can say that the path of the lightning was predetermined by the <u>laws</u> of <u>physics</u> before the lightning event just as we can say that the lightning only came into <u>existence</u> because such a path even existed in the 1<sup>st</sup> place.  In other words, the instance of lightning is a consequence of the preexisting <u>energy</u> fields.

The same <u>concept</u> holds for the thologram in that there can be almost countless combinations of <u>archetypes</u>, and therefore almost countless connections of <u>tholons</u> between the “beginning” and the “end”.  This implies that within the thologram exists every path of creation and/or growth that is possible *at that moment in time*, but the paths that will be traveled are those that represent the path of least <u>resistance</u>, and what we see as <u>reality</u> around us is a consequence of <u>energy</u> moving through those paths.

As new combinations come into being, new paths emerge, but for the most part, these new paths will emerge from the “bottom”, or end-points of the <u>hierarchy</u>, as these are the most unstable and dynamic, similar to the unstable borders of a fractal.  Each <u>tholon</u> represents a “step” in the path.  New paths are rarer as we move up the <u>hierarchy</u> as these higher-order <u>tholons</u> have achieved a stable state that is held in place by the <u>induction</u> of their parents and children, and short of a radical change in <u>energy</u>, they will not change.  The <u>force</u> of the <u>energy</u> that would be needed to affect a change is inversely proportional to their ancestors and proportional to their descendants.  This is why <u>reality</u> “is confined by rules that may be shockingly narrow”, to quote Charles S. <u>Cockell</u>  from his book “*The Equations of Life: How <u>Physics</u> Shapes <u>Evolution</u>*” and suggests that form and <u>life</u> across the <u>Universe</u> may not vary as much as we might imagine.

An example of these new emerging paths would be the creation of a new element in the periodic chart.  All elements past the element of uranium are man-made, so they are new creations, but they are also extremely unstable, unsustainable, and don’t last very long.  A new stable path even a little way up from the “bottom” would dramatically alter reality.

Starting from the beginning, immediately upon the 1<sup>st</sup> <u>awareness</u> of a non-existent dot in the void of <u>nothingness</u>, A&I began self-replicating into smaller and smaller divisions.  These divisions stop at some point where no <u>sustainable</u> <u>patterns</u> can be achieved, perhaps because the difference is too small or weak,  or other reasons.  The depth of a <u>tholon</u>’s <u>scope</u> can be described as the difference between 2 states, the delta of the <u>duality</u> of that <u>scope</u>, similar to the definition of <u>voltage</u> we saw above, which presumably gets smaller and smaller with each generation (but not necessarily).

As the parents and children of a <u>tholon</u> change, so too will that <u>tholon</u> adapt to these changes by having its <u>scope</u> adjusted.  In doing so, the thologram is *problem-solving* in real-time.  More than that, it is doing this in a heuristic manner, i.e., a manner based on experience.  How? Because the (only successful) changes that have been made in the past resulted in changes to the entire thologram and the consequence of those changes define the context of each <u>tholon</u>’s current condition.

The working hypothesis is that the thologram has a <u>memory</u> of everything that has ever happened to it that resulted in a successful change, and this chain-of-records is continued with each <u>tholon</u> that is created.  However, there can be many <u>tholons</u> occupying the same space because of the embedded <u>nature</u> of <u>tholons</u>, so if you reference a <u>tholon</u> at the “bottom” of the thologram, you are implicitly referencing every parent <u>tholon</u> in the chain of tholons back to the very 1<sup>st</sup> tholon.  What this suggests is that any instance of a <u>tholon</u> is also an implicit reference to many <u>tholons</u> and the path or chain that connects them.

What this tells us is that each instance is a 3D perspective of a very multi-dimensional form of <u>energy</u> that describes one “path” from the first <u>tholon</u> to the <u>tholon</u> in question but which we 3D dwellers experience as past, present, and future (like the 3D ball passing through 2D space example previously).

Two strangers, Bob and Carol, bump into each other at the butcher shop.  This interaction is the result of countless steps that had to happen starting with the Big Bang.  The path from the 1<sup>st</sup> moment of creation to the current instance that it took for Bob and his ancestors to arrive at this point and time we’ll call path B, and the same for Carol we’ll call path C.  Path B and path C already existed in the thologram, and Bob and Carol just happen to be the current instance of the <u>fields</u> of these two paths that connected because it was the path of least <u>resistance</u>, for whatever reasons, like the two <u>fields</u> that connected to create lightning.  There are effectively an infinite <u>number</u> of paths and their <u>fields</u>, but the point where Bob and Carol meet is the only point where the two <u>fields</u>, of which they are the current instances of, connect.  If <u>reality</u> itself is the <u>memory</u> store then anything that emerges from this meeting will inherit the “implicit <u>information</u>” of both paths that led to their meeting.

<img src='../Images/graphs-vertical.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>Every path that can be traveled by any instance already exists because the fields already exist.  The path is the expression of the fields interacting.  We tend to wander through this matrix of possibilities in a manner that appears aimless, similar to the manner bacteria wander about in their puddles of plasma, but from the tholonic perspective, these paths are determined by various cooperative and competing tholonic fields.

Perhaps one of the best instances of this that is easily understood is music.  Consider that a finite <u>number</u> of notes exist, but within those notes an almost infinite <u>number</u> of tunes can be written.  If we mapped every combination of notes, the tune could be seen as a path on that map.  This is more than just a thought experiment… it’s an actual undertaking by music theorist <u>Julian Hook</u>, who described in his article  “*Exploring Musical Space*”,[^178] how the <u>harmonic</u> path of a Beethoven sonata can be visualized on a *Tonnetz* graph (left)&hellip; a graph that happens to look just like a 2D <u>tholon</u> map.  In this example, the notes are acting like the <u>fields</u>, and the playing of those notes represents <u>energy</u> moving through these <u>fields</u>, forming music, or lightning, plants, rivers, <u>neurons</u>, and everything else.

[^178]: Hook, Julian, “**Exploring Musical Space**”, 2006, Science, 49-50, V 313, 5783, doi:10.1126/science.1129300, https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1129300


Music also demonstrates how certain <u>patterns</u> can lay down the foundations upon which other <u>patterns</u> and expressions build upon.  For example, there are many different types of scales, such as *pentatonic*, which has 5 notes per octave, or the *Western Major Scale*, with the classic 7 notes most Westerners are used to.  Sound occurs when <u>energy</u> is applied to matter, and notes represent the *dots* that we have identified within that <u>chaos</u> of white <u>noise</u> through our power of reasoning.  We form <u>patterns</u> and connect these dots that exist in the sea of <u>chaos</u> that is all sound, and by doing so we create “music”.  We describe white <u>noise</u> as all <u>frequencies</u> expressed at once, but it is equally accurate to describe white <u>noise</u> as every possible <u>pattern</u> of all possible notes being performed at once, similar to how incoherent white light is an infinite number of coherent frequencies and directions.  This tells us that all possible forms of music, all songs, rhythms, beats, arrangements, etc., already exist within that white <u>noise</u> and all that we can do is discover them.

This discovery is not limited to <u>humans</u>, as we see this same thing in song birds.  Of course, believing this will depend on which church of <u>science</u> you are faithful to.

In 2012, *<u>Science</u> Magazine* published an article citing a report from the *Journal of Animal Behavior* titled “*Is birdsong music? Evaluating <u>harmonic</u> intervals in songs of a Neotropical songbird*”[^311] that concluded that  any musicality we might hear in a bird’s song is nothing more than projection on the human’s part.  2 years later, however, they published an article that cites a later study from the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, titled “*Overtone-based pitch selection in hermit thrush song: Unexpected <u>convergence</u> with scale construction in human music*”[^310], which concluded that birds most likely choose the notes they sing, and that these notes are the same notes that we <u>humans</u> have also selected to create our musical scales.

Science article available at: https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/11/birds-found-using-human-musical-scales-first-time

The <u>tholonic</u> position is simply that some <u>patterns</u> are more stable and efficient than others, such as the <u>harmonic</u> series, so we would expect to see it in music, bird songs, fungal growth, orbits, and countless other contexts.

Even in the world of bacterial meandering, we see a pattern.  Not surprisingly, it is the inverse of a <u>Bell curve</u>, in that a group of <u>bacteria</u> released at the same time starts out relatively <u>coherent</u> and eventually disperses to incoherence.  It’s almost (or exactly) as if the instances of creations emerge from a <u>tholon</u>’s <u>Bell curve</u> in a manner inverse to that <u>Bell curve</u>, like a kind of <u>balancing</u> factor, much like the way a positive charge will automatically create a pairing with a negative charge, or how the amount of water that falls to the <u>earth</u> (rain) is equivalent to the amount of water that rises into the sky (evaporation) from the earth.  States of <u>order</u> create states of <u>chaos</u>, which create new states of order.  It also appear that archetypes are always decreasing in entropy, becoming more ordered, while their instance are always increasing in entropy.  This is possible because in teh world of archetypes, there is no *arrow of time*, only *arrow of order*.

#### **Key 79:** <u>Archetypes</u> tend toward <u>order</u>, while instances tend toward chaos.


In the early generations of the thologram, the <u>numbers</u> of paths are limited, and with the additional generations, the <u>number</u> of paths increase.  This <u>movement</u> may appear <u>random</u>, but not only does it disperse according to a <u>Bell curve</u>, it actually follows the same rules as the thologram itself in that it is self-similar and <u>fractal</u> in nature.[^179]

Although this sounds like predeterminism, which it effectively is, there are so many paths that can be traveled that for all intents and purposes predeterminism doesn’t apply.  <u>Tholonically</u> speaking, it appears as though we may have free will, but only with regard in determining which predetermined path we follow.  It also looks like <u>existence</u> itself is the unfolding, explicating, instantiating of every possible combination of <u>sustainable</u> <u>patterns</u> that exist to establish a <u>balance</u> between differing fields.

If energy always travels the path of least resistance, than why doesn;t everyone and everything follow only a single path? Wouldn't that suggest that energy doesn’t always that the path or least resistance?  It would if everything was exactly the same, but thanks to chaos, the slightest change can have radical results.  Still chaos doesn’t create randomness, so where does the initial random change come from?  There only needs to be a single random event, or random seed, at the beginning of creation, and the power laws and chaos will create new events from that single seed, which will appear and act as if random. What that physical event was it unknown, but in the tholonic model, the 1<sup>st</sup> and only true random event, an event that has no reason, no cause, is the appearance of the 0-dimensional dot which came into existence via Awareness and Intention.  This suggests that every event that results from that 1<sup>st</sup> event, which is all events, has some randomness built into it, but it also suggests that Awareness and Intention, and perhaps *only* A&I, have the ability to create random events.  This is a philosophical idea, and the specifics of how this would work in unknown, but the point beign made is that randomnss is buitl into creation and existance.

But there is another concept to consider regarding paths of least resistance. As was demonstrated in the effort expended listening to a lecture on “*Post-modern Fashion in Appalachia*” vs. digging a ditch, the concept of resistance can vary wildly.  What is least resistant for me is not what is least resistance to a sociology professor teaching “Dr. Seuss and Y(our) World” (at real class at, coincidentally, Appalachian State University).  This resistance is not electrical, thermodynamic, or mechanical, nor is the psychic energy it is resisting, but this psychic energy is just as influential in deciding what path will be chose.  As everything is energy, and energy travels the path of least resistance in the process of balancing itself, whatever this psychic energy is, it must also be traveling the path of least resistance and attempting to balance itself.

Although a bit of a tangent, and certainly worthy of more than a paragraph, it’s worth stating here that the idea of reincarnation has a <u>tholonic</u> explanation, which is: What some people believe to be past <u>life</u> experiences are <u>collective</u> <u>memories</u> associated with the path we happen to be instantiating, or traveling, if you will, and which we identify with mainly due to our <u>ego</u>’s <u>nature</u> to relate these inherited and embedded <u>memories</u> (and everything else, apparently) to one’s self.  This is why many people who believe in reincarnation will also believe they were some grand historical figure in a past <u>life</u>, as there will naturally be more instances (of people) in these well-worn paths of current <u>archetypes</u> simply because these paths are the paths of lesser resistance.

Applying this idea of multiple (and overlapping) instances to the thologram, there are different <u>patterns</u> that dominate our <u>reality</u> at different times, and as these <u>patterns</u> represent the instances that make up our <u>reality</u>, we can say that <u>reality</u>, from <u>atoms</u> to <u>ideas</u>, also differs across time.  In fact, the <u>concept</u> of an <u>atom</u> itself exists only because it is based on the <u>patterns</u> of <u>reality</u> we happen to be discovering at this point in our journey, but at other times in the past, and future, this <u>concept</u> has been and will change, or disappear altogether.  There was (or will be) a time when what we see as <u>atoms</u> are seen as spirits, or perhaps facets of a larger <u>intelligence</u>, or a 3D projection of a 248D magic <u>crystal</u>, or something we are incapable of imagining at this time.  The <u>laws</u> that control <u>atoms</u>, now and in the future, will also apply to “spirits” or intelligences, or however we choose to see them, but these <u>laws</u> will also be understood within the context and <u>scope</u> of the time.  Keep in mind that in the last 90 years alone, the model of the <u>electron</u> has morphed from a type of “mist” (1905), to little orbiting particles (1911), to standing <u>wave</u> <u>patterns</u> (1924), to the probability <u>fields</u> of <u>quantum mechanics</u> that extend to the edge of an entangled <u>Universe</u> (1926).

While every <u>tholon</u> is unique, its instances will usually be very similar. There is one <u>archetype</u> for a human, but there are many types of human instances.  There is no <u>reason</u> why there couldn’t be multiple near-identical instances of a <u>tholon</u>, and many reasons why there could be.  This <u>concept</u> has been around for a long time in the form of doppelgangers, twin strangers, alter egos, changelings, and has found a new home in <u>concepts</u> such as cloning and the multiverse.  <u>Metaphysics</u> has a similar <u>concept</u> of a *<u>soul</u> <u>family</u>*, which are groups of souls that share much of the same “<u>structure</u>”,  metaphysical <u>DNA</u>, so to speak, as they are part of the same <u>collective</u> of a larger “<u>soul</u>”.  It’s natural that such <u>concepts</u> would appear as we see this <u>concept</u> manifest in <u>nature</u>, especially among living organisms; many leaves from one branch, many branches from one tree, many trees from one root system.  Modern <u>science</u>, with the discovery of <u>DNA</u>, only adds support for this concept.

<u>Tholons</u> are more than just <u>archetypes</u> of things.  They are also <u>archetypes</u> of <u>ideas</u>, contexts, situations, experiences, concepts. Here are some of the more popular or well-known stories of “coincidences” that, when viewed <u>tholonically</u>, might offer insight.[^180]

### Laura Buxton

<img src='../Images/buxtons.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>In June of 2001, a 10-year-old girl named Laura Buxton released a balloon with her name and address on it.  That balloon floated 140 miles and landed in the back yard of a house where also lived a 10 year old girl named Laura Buxton.  On the day of the meeting, the two girls wore essentially the same outfit — a pink sweater and jeans.  The girls were the same height, which was unusual because they were both tall for their age.  They both had brown hair and wore it in the same style.  They both had three-year-old black Labrador Retrievers at home, as well as gray pet rabbits.  They both had guinea pigs, which were the same color and even had the same orange markings on their hindquarters.  It was almost as though these two Laura Buxtons were the same person.[^181] On the right is a picture of the two Laura Buxtons, who are still friends today.

[^181]: Quited directly from https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/whether-balloon/

*Here there are two contextually separated instances of one <u>tholonic</u> path.  What is fascinating about this is that the two instances, being of one <u>archetype</u>, would naturally have an existing connection with some opposing attributes, like how a photon, when split, has two opposing spins that are forever entangled. This connection, or entanglement, was instantiated via the red balloon that carried the address between the receiving side and the transmission side of this split instance.*

### King Umberto I’s double

In Monza, Italy, King Umberto I went to a small restaurant for dinner, accompanied by his aide-de-camp, General Emilio Ponzia-Vaglia.  When the owner took King Umberto’s <u>order</u>, the King noticed that he and the restaurant owner were virtual doubles, in face and in build.  Both men began discussing the striking resemblances between each other and found many more similarities.

- Both men were born on the same day, of the same year (March 14<sup>th</sup>, 1844).
- Both men had been born in the same town.
- Both men married a woman with the same name, Margherita.
- The restaurateur opened his restaurant on the same day that King Umberto was crowned King of Italy.
- On 29th July 1900, King Umberto was informed that the restaurateur had died that day in a mysterious shooting accident.  As he expressed his regret he was assassinated by an anarchist in the crowd.

*This looks like one <u>archetype</u> that instantiated in two different contexts.  This may also suggest that <u>tholonic</u> contexts are also archetypal, meaning there are “archetypal contexts” and “instantiated contexts”.*

### Twin boys, twin lives

Twin Ohio boys were separated at birth and adopted by different families.  Unknown to each other, both families named the boys James.  Both James grew up not even knowing of the other, yet both sought law-enforcement training, both had abilities in mechanical drawing and carpentry, and each had married women named Linda.  They both had sons whom one named James Alan and the other named James Allan.  The twin brothers also divorced their wives and married other women, both named Betty.  And they both owned <u>dogs</u> which they named Toy.  Forty years after their childhood separation, the two men were reunited.  (Source: Reader’s Digest, January 1980)

*This looks like two instances of the same <u>tholon</u> and context at birth, both of which traveled a similar path but in different contexts after birth.*

### Three strangers on a train

In the 1920s, three Englishman were traveling separately by train through Peru.  At the time of their introduction, they were the only three men in the railroad car.  Their introductions were more surprising than they could have imagined.  One man’s last name was Bingham, and the second man’s last name was Powell.  The third man announced that his last name was Bingham-Powell.  None were related in any way.  (Source: Mysteries of the Unexplained)

*Here, these three men, although having different lives, clearly shared some other details.  Does this suggest that even our names can be instances of a <u>pattern</u>? I have some experience with this personally.  For my entire <u>life</u> I have been fascinated with the lore of El Paso, Texas.  I had never been to El Paso prior to when I drove through the West Texas desert town in my 40s at around 4 AM in the morning.  It was an ugly town, but I found it incredibly alluring, for reasons I could not explain.  Years later I discovered that the a well known Old West <u>lawman</u> of El Paso, and I, shared the same name.  I can’t say if that is why I felt the way I did about El Paso, but there is no question that my name and El Paso share a strong <u>tholonic</u> bond, so some resonance would exist between these two concepts.*

### Richard Parker

Edgar Allan Poe wrote a story called “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym”.  This was a story about four survivors of a shipwreck who were in an open boat for many days before they decided to kill and eat the cabin boy whose name was Richard Parker.  Some years later, in 1884, the *Mignonette*, a 52 foot English Yacht, was capsized by a <u>wave</u> as they were traveling northwest of the Cape of Good Hope.  The four survivors found themselves together in an open boat for many days.  Eventually, the three senior members of the crew killed and ate the cabin boy, whose name was Richard Parker.

*Here a <u>pattern</u> took form as both a story and an experience.  Perhaps Poe was able to tune into certain <u>patterns</u> and share them.  Perhaps that is what creativity or genius is; the ability to tap into <u>patterns</u> that have yet to become instantiated.  p.s.  The men served only six months in prison and were then released.  They were the first men to ever serve time for <u>cannibalism</u> and murder on the high seas because it was considered a “custom of the sea”.  See “Her Majesty The Queen v. Tom Dudley and Edwin Stephens”, High Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division, 1884*.

### A writer’s plum pudding

In 1805, French writer Émile Deschamps was treated to some plum pudding by the stranger Monsieur de Fortgibu.  Ten years later, he encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to <u>order</u> some, but the waiter told him the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fortgibu.  Many years later in 1832 Émile Deschamps was at a diner and was once again offered plum pudding.  He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fortgibu was missing to make the setting complete and in the same instant the now senile de Fortgibu entered the room.

*This seems to be a very specific, yet persistence, <u>pattern</u> that required plum pudding and only instantiated when Deschamps and de Fortgibu were near one another.*

### A novel that unsuspectingly described the spy next door

When Norman Mailer began his novel *Barbary Shore*, there was no plan to have a Russian spy as a character.  As he worked on it, he introduced a Russian spy in the U.S. as a minor character.  As the <u>work</u> progressed, the spy became the dominant character in the novel.  After the novel was completed, the U.S. Immigration Service arrested a man who lived just one floor above Mailer in the same apartment building.  He was Colonel Rudolf Abel, alleged to be the top Russian spy working in the U.S. at that time.  (Source: <u>Science</u> Digest)

*Here is an example of <u>pattern</u> instantiating while at the same time being perceived and recorded by a bystander, similar to the Poe story, but in real-time, and again, in close proximity.*

### A falling baby saved twice by the same man

In Detroit sometime in the 1930s, a young (if incredibly careless) mother must have been eternally grateful to a man named Joseph Figlock.  As Figlock was walking down the street, the mother’s baby fell from a high window onto Figlock.  The baby’s fall was broken and both man and baby were unharmed.  One year later, the very same baby fell from the very same window onto the very same Joseph Figlock as he was again passing beneath.  And again, they both survived the event.  (Source: Mysteries of the Unexplained)

*If proximity is a factor, we have to wonder, if Figlock never walked down that street, would the baby have ever fallen?*

### A determined bullet

 In 1883, Henry Ziegland broke off a relationship with his girlfriend who, out of distress, committed suicide.  The girl’s brother was so enraged that he hunted down Ziegland and shot him.  The brother, believing he had killed Ziegland, then turned his gun on himself and took his own life.  But Ziegland had not been killed.  The bullet, in fact, had only grazed his face and then lodged in a tree.  Some years later, Ziegland decided to cut down the large tree, which still had the bullet in it.  The task seemed so formidable that he decided to blow it up with a few sticks of dynamite.  The explosion propelled the bullet into Zealand’s head, killing him.  (Source: Ripley’s Believe It or Not!)

*The <u>pattern</u> here is the bullet and the <u>intention</u> behind it.  Intentions alone can be their own pattern.  Here, it appears as though the <u>archetype</u> of the <u>intention</u> and the instance of the bullet formed a relationship with its own intention.*

From one perspective you could see all these stories as extremely unlikely coincidences.  From the <u>tholonic</u> perspective, each of these paths and each of these profiles are some of the almost countless <u>patterns</u> that managed to attain enough stability to instantiate.  One details that is very telling is what appears to be the proximity plays.  This would be expected is there was a strong <u>tholonic</u> <u>field</u> for these particular instances.

### Realistically Speaking

The above accounts represent some of the more extreme and rare instances of “coincidences” that are neat and clear.  In most cases they tend to be far more comical, confusing, and messy, like so much of life.  A more practical example that everyone can probably relate to is the following account that a reader shared after reading the above cases.

> This personal anecdote seems related to this chapter: I had a "Jessie" thing in my earlier life—many of them accumulated. Only part of that was—I was married to Jessie (#1) (whose boss's name was Jessie), and had an affair with a man named Jessie (#2), who was born in the town of Nelson. He had a wife named Lynn, a son named Alexander, and a daughter named Anastasia. My best male friend (who later became my 2nd husband) was named Nelson. His wife's name was Jessie and his girlfriend's name was Lynn. My middle name was Lynn. When I was expecting my second child, (not yet knowing the names of Jessie’s (#2) two children) I thought I might name a boy Alexander or a daughter Anastasia. I always thought this was weird and I didn't understand it. You've helped me understand it. (These are the things you don't put in fiction because they're TOO weird and fiction is supposed to make sense).

## <u>Life</u>, Death, Afterlife 

Every creation, including <u>tholons</u>, goes through the <u>cycles</u> of instantiation, this being inception, gestation, emergence, propagation, culmination, and dispersion.  This is just one description that identifies 6 stages.  There can be many others.  When a <u>tholon</u> “disperses”, whether due to loss of <u>energy</u>, <u>destruction</u>, absorption, or any <u>number</u> of ways, its stable <u>pattern</u> of <u>energy</u> can come to an end.  What then survives and where does the <u>energy</u> go?  The <u>energy</u> goes to wherever it can go with the least resistance.  This might be the parent <u>tholon</u> but perhaps it could be a peer as well.  It could also stay right where it is if there are no immediately available paths of lesser <u>resistance</u>, not unlike a static charge that is held until it can be released.  The various possibilities could easily describe what we commonly called the *oversoul*, ghosts, spirits of the dead, poltergeists, and various other types of disincarnates that are something like an *implicit instance*, or an instance that does not have the <u>structure</u>, <u>energy</u>, or opportunity necessary to take form, like the ink dots in the glycerin example.

## <u>Aliens</u> and UFOs

As long as we’re talking about the afterlife we might as well address the subject of <u>aliens</u> and UFOs.  This will be very short, because if the <u>tholonic</u> <u>understanding</u> that the <u>Universe</u> itself, and everything in it, are different expressions of <u>intelligence</u>, than asking "is there intelligent <u>life</u> in the <u>Universe</u>?" would be like wondering if there is such a thing as water while swimming in the ocean. <u>Aliens</u>, UFOs, etc., are instances of <u>archetypes</u>, and their instantiations will wholly depend on the context and <u>scope</u> they are perceived in.  Here, context includes <u>cultural</u> beliefs and the abilities of the perceiver.  Is/was <u>Earth</u> visited by <u>aliens</u>, and if so, what role have they played in our story?  From the <u>tholonic</u> perspective, asking such a question is valid if the answer brings us closer to a verifiably better <u>understanding</u> of reality.  The <u>tholonic</u> question is, what are the <u>tholons</u> that exist beyond our perception of <u>reality</u>? How can/will they be perceived and  how will/do they affect our <u>reality</u>? Are there other forms of SAI that have evolved on any of the 40 billion exoplanets that can support <u>life</u> in our galaxy, or elsewhere for that matter, evolved to the point where they have a cosmic influence? The most reasonable answer is probably "probably".

The <u>tholonic</u> view is (to rephrase Richard <u>Feynman</u>): 

> It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.

### Sadhguru explains

Some months after writing the above text, I “coincidentally” came across a short excerpt from a lecture by Jaggi Vasudev, a 62 year-old English Major turned yoga teacher in India.  He goes by the name *Sadhguru*, and currently runs an ashram. He has given speeches at the United Nations, and has founded the Isha Foundation which teaches yoga and appears to be heavily involved in environmental and spiritual issues.  He was addressing the question “Is there rebirth?” and his answer was especially <u>tholonic</u> in nature.  Below is a transcript of his answer, which was slightly modified for grammatical reasons alone, along with commentary.

> The question is, is there re-birth? If it’s there, what is the basis for one being to go from one birth to another? What is it that carries a person from one to another?  Now, if you need to understand this, you must have some <u>understanding</u> of the mechanics of who you are.  <u>I am</u> talking about the mechanics of how a human being is built.  When you say “<u>I am</u> a human being”, you are speaking of the outermost periphery, the physical body.  In yoga, we look at everything as “body” because it is easier for you to understand it that way.  So we see the body as five dimensions or five sheaths.

> Physical body is known as *Annamaya Kosha*.  *Anna* means “the food.” This is the food body.  The next one is called *Manomaya Kosha*, which refers to the mental body.  The third one is called *Pranamaya Kosha*, which refers to the <u>energy</u> body.  Physical body, mental body, <u>energy</u> body, all these three dimensions are physical.  They are physical existence.  Physical body is very gross, mental body is subtler, <u>energy</u> body is even subtler but all these three are physical.  This is just like the light bulb is physical, you can see that.  The <u>electricity</u> behind [the light bulb] also is physical, isn’t it?  The wire that connects is also physical; the <u>electrons</u> that flow through the wire also are physical existence.  So similarly, physical body, mental body, *pranic* body all are physical dimensions of life.

Not surprisingly, we are seeing the <u>tholonic</u> trigram model.  In this case it is the <u>energy</u> of our being (prana), the matter of our being (physical), and the integration of our being (mental, as all of <u>reality</u> is an instance of <u>intelligence</u>).  These are contextual instances of *<u>Negotiation</u>*, *Definition*,  and *<u>Contribution</u>*.

>  This physical dimension of <u>life</u> in all these three dimensions carries the imprints of karma; On the body, it is imprinted, on the mind it’s imprinted and on the <u>energy</u> it’s imprinted.  This karmic imprint, or the karmic <u>structure</u>, is what holds it together.  Karma is the cement which holds you to the physical body.  Karma is the bondage at the same time.  It’s only because of karmic stuff you can hold on to the body and be here.

He points out that karma here is a synonym for <u>structure</u>, and it is this <u>structure</u> that accounts for the <u>existence</u>, or instantiation, of things.  The <u>concept</u> of karma tends to be associated with values and judgments, <u>ideas</u> such as good and bad, right and wrong, but outside of these subjective and <u>culturally</u> relative <u>ideas</u>, karma is <u>structure</u>, and that <u>structure</u>, from the <u>tholonic</u> perspective, is the thologram in its entirety.  The thologram is the <u>structure</u> of karma, and karma is the <u>law</u> of instantiation.

> This is where spirituality seems to be difficult because if you try to take it away it doesn’t work.  If you try to add, it doesn’t work.  You need to be just there.  If you’re just there, it’s a moment.  The next two dimensions are called *Vignanamaya Kosha* and *Anandamaya Kosha*.  *Vignanamaya Kosha* is non-physical but related to the physical.  It is like a transient state.  *Anandamaya Kosha* is completely non-physical.  So, *Vignanamaya Kosha* and *Anandamaya Kosha* means it’s the bliss body.

If we replace the <u>concept</u> of *spirituality* with the <u>concept</u> of a *tetrahedron*, we can also say “If you try to take any part (a bot) away, it doesn’t work.  If you try to add  any part, it doesn’t work. It can only be (a tetrahedron)".

In the <u>tholonic</u> model there is a similar <u>concept</u> of the *koshas*, for prior to the realm of instantiation, or the physical <u>reality</u>, there are two states.  These are the two points (that have dimension) that must exist before the 3<sup>rd</sup> dimensional point can be created.  The first point of dimension is the *green dot* of *Definition* (*Anandamaya Kosha*) which defines 1 dimension.  This point has no actual <u>existence</u> outside of uninstantiated awareness.  It is essentially the perfect <u>awareness</u> of <u>awareness</u> (the N-state is a state of pure <u>awareness</u>).   This is followed by the *red dot* (*Vignanamaya Kosha*), the point of *<u>Contribution</u>*, and the addition of another dimension.  This dot, which Sadhguru says is a transitional state, is what allows  the form to come into <u>existence</u>, and is the dot that returns the <u>energy</u> to the N-source .  

> There is a bliss body inside which is one-hundred percent non-physical.  It has no form of its own.  Only if the <u>energy</u> body, the mental body, and the physical body are in shape it can hold the bliss body in shape.  If these things are taken away the bliss body will just become a part of the cosmos.  So whatever you are referring to as *atman* or the <u>soul</u> is a fiction actually, in a sense, because people are describing a certain <u>limitation</u> of the non-physical as a <u>soul</u>, but the body for the <u>soul</u> is still your karma.  If the karmic <u>structure</u> is completely dismantled, there is no soul; everything merges into everything else.  What is referred to as *Mahasamadhi* or *Mahaparinirvana*, is just this; that you slowly understand where the keys are and dismantle the karmic <u>structure</u> so that you become truly no more.

This is profoundly similar to the <u>tholonic</u> model in that without any <u>structure</u> there are no instances, no archetypes.  The <u>concept</u> of a <u>soul</u> here is equivalent to that of a parent <u>tholon</u>, or the higher <u>order</u> of <u>structure</u> that have xlead to a thing’s existence.  <u>Tholonically</u>, there is no difference between the “<u>soul</u>” of a human and the “<u>soul</u>” of a rock in that they are both instances of the primal <u>awareness</u> at different points within the thologram.  His claim that “If the karmic <u>structure</u> is completely dismantled, there is no <u>soul</u>” also applies in that “If the <u>tholonic</u> <u>structure</u> is completely dismantled, there is only a 0-dimensional <u>concept</u> of SAI”

>  When somebody dies, we say this person is no more, but that’s not true.  That person is no more the way you know them, but they still very much exist.  Now, if you dismantle the karmic <u>structure</u> one-hundred percent, now you merge with the existence.  This is what is referred to as *Mukti*.  In yogic tradition, it is referred to as *Mahasamadhi*.  In the <u>Buddhist</u> way it is called *Mahaparinirvana*.  Generally in English we say *liberation*.

Remove the <u>structure</u>, i.e. remove the green-dot and the red-dot, and you are left only with pure <u>Awareness</u> (and <u>Intention</u>).

> Liberation means becoming free from the very process of <u>life</u> and birth and death.  Liberation means becoming free from the basic <u>structures</u> of body and mind, and for all this, the karmic <u>structure</u> are the strings that hold these things together.  So, when a person dies, obviously, the physical body is something that you borrowed from the earth.  This body is just <u>earth</u>, isn’t it?  You understand?  This physical body is just a piece of <u>earth</u>, which is right now prancing around as your body.  But you have to pay it back, <u>atom</u> to atom.  No interest though, but you have to pay back every atom.  You won’t be allowed to carry a single <u>atom</u> from this <u>planet</u>, nobody has managed it.  (Laughs) 

<u>Tholons</u> are the creations of <u>tholons</u>, and those <u>tholons</u> that can instantiate have a life-span, whether it’s 26 nanoseconds or 6&times;10<sup>99</sup> years.  They exist due to <u>laws</u> and limits.  Using Sadhguru’s words, we can say it is the karma of a pion to exist for only 26 nanoseconds.  The underlying <u>law</u> of the <u>tholon</u> is that everything is seeking a <u>balance</u>, which is why everything must be ”paid back”, i.e., the final <u>balance</u> must be zero.  The body's return to the <u>earth</u> is the same idea as the <u>energy</u> of a <u>tholon</u>’s instance returning to the parent <u>tholon</u>, but within the context of the material world.

> The physical body will fall apart, but the mental body and the pranic body, depending upon the strength of your karma, goes on.  If the karmic <u>structure</u> is very intense, unfinished, then it has to finish it.  If the karma has become weak because it has run its course, then it very easily finds another body.  If it has to find another body, the intensity of this <u>structure</u> should come down, it should become passive.  If it is very intense, it cannot find a body, so it just hangs there.  This is what you are referring to as ghosts.  Somebody is dead; his karmic <u>structure</u> is still intense because it’s not over.  He still exists, but he needs much more time to find another body.  The more intense his karmic <u>structure</u> is, the more visible he becomes and the more experientially available to people.  There are innumerable such beings all around you, whether you know it or not, but most of them you won’t feel because their karma is dissipated.  They are just waiting for more dissipation before they find another body.

What is here referred to as the *karmic <u>structure</u>* is equivalent to the stability of a tholon.  A super-stable <u>tholon</u>, such as the <u>structure</u> of hydrogen or whatever forces in <u>existence</u> account for Plank’s Constant, are not about to fall apart any time soon.  One of the reasons for this (and maybe the sole <u>reason</u>) is because there are too many other <u>tholons</u> in <u>existence</u> that depend on it, and therefore support and reinforce the <u>existence</u> of hydrogen or Plank’s Constant.  Weak karma is equivalent to the disintegration of a <u>tholon</u>‘s <u>structure</u>, whose <u>energy</u> will quickly find another path, or if not, hang around waiting to discharge.

> This is why [we believe] that if somebody dies unnaturally, either by accident or <u>suicide</u> or some other way, they will become ghosts.  This is not correct as everybody becomes a ghost.  It is just that those with intense karma are more available to your experience because they have more intense karmic <u>structures</u>, so people may experience them a little more than other beings who die of old age.  If one completes his allotted karma for that <u>life</u>, he will simply die, just like that.  Without <u>disease</u>, without accident, without any injury.  When one dies simply like that, that person may find another body within hours.  This is why [it is said that] if one completes his <u>life</u> and dies peacefully it’s the best way to die because he need not hang around and can immediately move on.

Sadhguru says that intense karmic <u>structures</u> prevents someone from reincarnating immediately and that this intense, or highly energized and imbalanced <u>structure</u> can be perceived as various types of disincarnates, or *implicit instances*.  In one way, each <u>tholon</u> and its instance is like a battery, functioning until it has <u>balanced</u> out its energy.  This undissipated or imbalanced <u>energy</u> can only exist in the same <u>energy</u> <u>patterns</u> that allowed for its <u>existence</u> in the first place, hence, a new instance, with new <u>energy</u> <u>patterns</u>, will not be possible until the old <u>energy</u> <u>patterns</u> have balanced.

This sounds similar to how a particular <u>electron</u> that is part of the <u>energy</u> in the clouds before a lightning storm can not be used in a light bulb until the lightning has discharged and the <u>electrons</u> are returned to the ground, <u>balancing</u> the charge and making those <u>electrons</u> available to the light bulb circuit.

> For those who walk the spiritual path, the ultimate goal for every spiritual seeker is he wants to break this whole process.  What you call your <u>soul</u> is like a bubble.  The outer periphery of the bubble is your karmic structure.  Inside there is air.  Suppose you burst the bubble.  Where is the air?  Where is *your* air?  There is no such thing as *your* air; it’s become part of everything.  So what you refer to as <u>soul</u> is fictitious because there is no such thing as *your* <u>soul</u> and *my* <u>soul</u> and somebody else’s soul.  Right now, this unboundedness is contained in a limited karmic <u>structure</u>, so it makes you believe as if this is a separate entity.  If you take away the keys which hold the karmic <u>structure</u>, then it just collapses.

What you call anything, be it yourself, a plant, a river, a bug, is a <u>tholon</u>, and a <u>tholon</u> is simply a <u>structure</u> that emerged from <u>energy</u> moving through whatever resources are available and interacting with itself according to the limits and <u>laws</u> of those resources and its context and scope.  This is a verbose description of a bubble.  Within that <u>structure</u> is the “thing”&hellip; no <u>structure</u> equals no thing.

In both Sadhguru’s model of <u>reality</u> and the <u>tholonic</u> model, transcending the <u>cycle</u> of creation and <u>destruction</u> and <u>life</u> and death can be achieved by realizing one is “nothing more” than a state of SAI.  But there is another very important <u>concept</u> that can also be applied, and that is, while every <u>tholon</u> is a product of creation, not every <u>tholon</u> is itself a creator.  It is up to the reader to apply this <u>concept</u> to their own <u>existence</u>, but to this point, Sadhguru also expresses this very <u>tholonic</u> <u>concept</u> (The word “organized” has been replaced with “<u>structured</u>”):

> The <u>structured</u> mind produces <u>structured</u> emotions, and this increases the <u>energy</u> that moves through and <u>structures</u> the body.  When one’s complete being, mind, emotion, body and the <u>energy</u> that moves through them, is then <u>structured</u>, they are not simply a piece of creation but a creator with ability to manifest their vision.

### Direction of <u>Intention</u>

Here we return to the <u>concept</u> of *<u>intention</u>* which was skipped over previously.  Looking at the <u>tholonic</u> model, it would be easy to imagine how it could evolve towards some very dark sides of <u>existence</u> just as easily as it could towards bright sides because there is no implicit morality or definition of right or wrong.  The <u>tholon</u> is a <u>structure</u>, a machine, so to speak.  While there are plenty of examples of dark instances throughout the history of <u>existence</u>, on the whole, <u>existence</u> has tended towards being a <u>contributing</u> factor to life.  We can say that this is because no matter what the direction of <u>intention</u>, it will always tend toward being <u>balanced</u>, so it has a built in protection against going too far to one side or another, as the <u>laws</u> of <u>physics</u> shows us.  

There is another <u>understanding</u> as well which can be understood using the same powers of observation and <u>reason</u> that fuels scientific thinking.  In its simplest form, we can say that it has been observed that, for the most part in <u>life</u>, the body prefers <u>health</u> and pleasure over sickness and suffering, the mind prefers peace and joy over violence and misery, and emotions of <u>love</u> and compassion are preferred over hate.  This would suggest that the original <u>intention</u> of creation was more in the direction of <u>health</u>, peace, and <u>love</u> than sickness, violence and hate.  

One could argue that these preferences are only a result of <u>evolution</u> as they <u>contributed</u> to survival, but that would only support the argument that this was the original intention.  In <u>reality</u>, we tend to see both sides working together, as in the very parasitic relationship between the predatory <u>wasp</u> and the slower <u>cockroaches</u>, but as we also see in that example, that it is ultimately a benefit to the <u>cockroach</u> gene pool and <u>tholonic</u> intelligence.  Think of it as <u>Nature</u>'s *tough <u>love</u>*.  The same goes for any synergetic system, from rabbits and coyotes to political systems.  

*Constructive collaboration* only needs a slight edge over *destructive <u>resistance</u>* to ensure that <u>reality</u> will be more constructive than destructive, even if it at times <u>destruction</u> is winning.  This is similar to how the casino’s “house” only needs a 0.5% edge at the Black Jack table to transfer the players <u>money</u> into their coffers.  The house does not care about the individual winners or losers because they know that they have that 0.5% advantage, which is all they need to survive, and even thrive.  Our highly unscientific, unprovable, irrelevantly small sampling in the “Bless or Curse” experiment suggests that *constructive collaboration* has a house edge of about 2.5%, at least among the sample group for that moment in time.

The human <u>brain</u>, <u>cellular</u> mechanics, and all <u>life</u> in general, is wired to be both competitive[^182] and cooperative[^183] at the same time, which implies that this is (so far) the most effective manner for an instance to express the <u>intention</u> of its <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetype</u> that has its source in the *primal <u>intention</u>*.
