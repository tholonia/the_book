# 2: ENERGY

###### Nothing exists without <u>energy</u>.  Everything exists within the <u>laws</u> of <u>energy</u>.

##### **Synopsis:** Nothing exists without <u>energy</u> as everything is an expression of <u>energy</u>.  This includes thought, <u>archetypes</u>, <u>ideas</u>, <u>concepts</u>, etc.  Energy creates <u>patterns</u>, which creates <u>archetypes</u>, which creates form.  Form and <u>archetype</u> are instances of the same expression in different contexts.  Our <u>understanding</u> of <u>energy</u> (and of all things) is limited by our abilities to perceive and understand.

##### **Keywords:** <u>energy</u>, <u>archetypes</u>, reality, material

The topic of <u>energy</u> will be reviewed many times further on, but at this stage it’s only important to point out two types of <u>energy</u>; *<u>kinetic</u>* <u>energy</u>, which is the <u>energy</u> capable of causing change to a system as a result of <u>movement</u>, such as water passing through a turbine in a dam, and *<u>potential</u>* <u>energy</u>, which is the <u>energy</u> that is not moving but is available, such as all the water in the dam that is not yet passing through the turbine.

Where the primal <u>energy</u> came from that created our universe is still, and will probably remain, unanswered, at least by modern <u>science</u>.  Science, mythology, and <u>religion</u> each have their own stories and theories, and, not surprisingly, many of these theories are not that <u>conceptually</u> far apart from each other.  One thing we can say about the <u>energy</u> that created this universe (if we are to believe the first <u>law</u> of <u>thermodynamics</u> that states <u>energy</u> cannot be destroyed or created) is that it existed before the Universe was created.

For our purpose, at least at this moment, the details of these theories or stories don’t matter.  What does matter is the general idea that once <u>energy</u> was introduced into the <u>chaos</u> of the void, something happened.  That “something” was some sort of <u>movement</u>, as that is the undebatable <u>nature</u> of <u>energy</u>; it’s always moving.  This <u>energy</u> moves in accordance with certain <u>laws</u>, and in the context of a duality.  This duality can be of <u>somethingness</u>/<u>nothingness</u>, 1/0, any <u>polarity</u>, or any difference between 2 things that can potentially interact.

#### **Key 5:** Everything exists in a state of duality.

The question then becomes, did these <u>laws</u> exist before creation? Did they exist in the chaotic <u>primal void</u> of <u>nothingness</u>? Well, the reasonable answer is yes&hellip; and no.  “No”, they did not exist in the <u>primal void</u> because these <u>laws</u> only apply where time and space exist, neither of which existed prior to the introduction of <u>energy</u>.  “Yes”, in that these <u>laws</u> must have existed “in theory”&hellip; e.g.  the relation of a circle’s circumference to its radius existed as the constant *pi* (&pi;), or the relationship between a circle and a square is an infinite regression, but as there were no circles or squares it was not measurable&hellip; there was no *instance* of *pi* (&pi;), but there was, for lack of a better word, an *<u>archetype</u>* of those relationships.  In this context, we are using the traditional and current <u>definition</u> of the word *<u>archetype</u>* as per the Oxford English Dictionary:

> The most typical or perfect example of a particular kind of person or thing

The only place where the <u>potential</u> for anything to exist, including <u>concepts</u>, <u>ideas</u>, or <u>archetypes</u>, is in a place where something *can* exist; a place where <u>somethingness</u> *coexists* with <u>nothingness</u>.  0 can exist, and &infin; can exist, but unless they commingle there will never be <u>numbers</u> (or anything else).  When they do mix, <u>numbers</u> appear, and with them, these archetypal <u>laws</u>, such as *&pi; r <sup>2</sup>* and *1+1=2*, become instantiated in reality.  “But!” you may be thinking, “If <u>archetypes</u> can only exist in a duality, and there was no duality before *<u>somethingness</u>* appeared in *<u>nothingness</u>*, how could the <u>archetypes</u> have existed?”  Well, they couldn’t, which suggests that there was a preexisting duality that our currently reality emerged from wherein these <u>archetypes</u> and <u>laws</u> already existed.  Perhaps that preexisting duality is a “sea” of infinite “<u>waves</u>” of uninstantiated possibilities forever crashing upon the shores of matter?  This poetic description also applies to what <u>quantum mechanics</u> calls the *<u>wave</u> functions* that represent all <u>potential</u> instances, but until one of those <u>waves</u> *collapses* into material form it will remain in the duality of lonely <u>archetypes</u>.  

In quantum physics, the only <u>waves</u> that will ever reach the shores of form are those that have the highest probability of doing so.  The realization of that which is most likely to happen will probably happen is not the profound part of this quantum insight.  The profound part is the realization that reality is a multidimensional cosmic casino.  We don’t know where an <u>electron</u> exists.  We only know the probability of where we might find an <u>electron</u>.  The probability field of an <u>electron</u> in your finger stretches out to the end of the universe, but the odds of finding one of your finger’s <u>electrons</u> on Zeta Reticuli 39.3 light years away is as likely as hitting the winning <u>number</u> on a roulette wheel with 10<sup>82</sup> <u>numbers</u> (that’s a roulette wheel 10<sup>76</sup> light-years wide in diameter which would take 10<sup>60</sup> years to spin just once if it was spinning at the <u>speed of light</u> - yes, this is a very silly, but nevertheless interesting detail).  Much more likely, your finger’s <u>electron</u> is very likely to be found where it is right now; in your finger&hellip;but there’s a *chance* it *could* appear on Zeta Reticuli, and for all you know, some of your <u>electrons</u> are there right now!  But even that’s not the most mind-blowing part, because if an <u>electron</u> is actually a <u>wave</u> that is described by a <u>potential</u> field, and that field extends to the end of the universe, than that <u>electron</u> is as big as the universe, that is, until it collapses into a femtometer-sized dot (that’s 10<sup>-15</sup> of a meter, or 0.000000000000001 m).  Every <u>electron</u>’s field in your body, and everything else, extends to every corner of <u>existence</u>… at least in the archetypal realm of <u>laws</u> that our reality exists within and to the best of our ability to understand those <u>laws</u>.

## Modern Concept, Ancient History

Without getting too much into philosophy here, the idea of archetypal forms is a very <u>Platonic</u> idea.  <u>Plato</u>’s *Theory of <u>ideas</u>* is the hypothesis that everything that exists is a material instance of an ideal version, or perfect idea, of that thing.

It is also a very Kant-ish idea, and a very Locke-ish, Descartes-ish and Hume-ish idea, for all these great thinkers, plus many more, had the <u>understanding</u> in one form or another that *things* were primarily *<u>ideas</u>* or *<u>concepts</u>* first.  Not all philosophers and scientists-of-old agreed, and in the good ol’ days the debate usually boiled down to some form of “is there a god?”[^7] Today, <u>science</u> tends to shy away from the <u>concept</u> of a god, but asks equally impossible questions, such as “is reality a <u>hologram</u>?” or “is <u>existence</u> a simulation?”, etc.  That question is answered in this book, but the answer is as maddening as it is enlightening, and words like “yes” or “no” become meaningless.

[^7]: This idea, and much more, is discussed at length in a 89 volume edition of great works that question the nature of existence.  Glattfelder, James B.

For pretty much all of man’s history there has been an archetypal, theoretical, spiritual, or mystical <u>concept</u> of a realm of <u>ideas</u>.  In this realm, forms, in their unmanifest, uninstantiated state, are simply <u>ideas</u>.  The perfect cube, for example, is a <u>concept</u> we all can grasp, but whose instances in the material world can only approach.  These archetypal forms follow archetypal <u>laws</u> for if they did not then the relationship between the area of a circle and its radius could just as well be “elephant toes on Tuesday afternoon”, or “cat dog moo”.

This <u>concept</u> that unmanifest forms are the same as <u>ideas</u>, existing in a non-physical, non-manifest, non-instantiated state, provides a very neat explanation as to the origin and <u>nature</u> of the <u>laws</u> of physics.  Just as physical forms, like the ball and the cube, have their ideal <u>archetypes</u>, the <u>laws</u> of physics and <u>nature</u> have their archetypal forms as well.

The <u>laws</u> of a form and the form itself are not separate things; they are the same thing in two different forms of expression.  Form itself is simply the result of a function, or by-product, of the <u>law</u> as it is expressed within some material context.  The form *is* the instantiation of the <u>law</u>.  A circle is defined by its <u>law</u>, 2*πr*, and what we see as a circle is an instance of this <u>law</u>.  Archetypes can also have <u>archetypes</u>, which we might refer to as *meta*-*<u>archetype</u>* or *meta-type*.  For example the *meta*-*type* or *meta*-*<u>archetype</u>* of circle (2*πr*) is the <u>concept</u> of a dot which is a 0-dimensional point.  

#### **Key 6:** Theories and <u>ideas</u> are an <u>archetype</u> in their own right, but like forms, they also have their own <u>archetypes</u>.

Laws are the blueprints of form, and forms are the instances of the blueprint. How do we know that the <u>laws</u> were not derived from the form, rather than the form being derived from the <u>law</u>? This is addressed in more depth further on, but the evidence is that the same <u>laws</u> exist across many forms.  One specific <u>archetype</u>, like that of a cube or a sphere, can have many instances, but a cube or a sphere cannot have many <u>archetypes</u>.  This puts the <u>laws</u> of form “higher” in the unfolding process of its creation, as the <u>law</u> must exist before the formation or instantiation of the <u>law</u>.  This is additionally supported by the idea that the <u>laws</u> themselves are an expression of <u>energy</u>, the ordering <u>force</u> behind all <u>existence</u>, and therefore a prerequisite to form, be it archetypal or material.

#### **Key 7:** Levels of <u>order</u> begin with <u>energy</u>, which has <u>laws</u> regarding how it interacts with itself, which form <u>patterns</u> (<u>archetypes</u>), which create things (have material instances).

You may be asking “OK, but what if <u>Plato</u> and the gang were wrong?”, but this is not a relevant question because that question assumes that we have access to, or can grasp, the “ultimate truth”, if one even exists.  Our theories of reality are predictive models based on our <u>understanding</u> and abilities that are valid for the reality we are able to observe.

#### **Key 8:** All theories are only valid for a level of <u>awareness</u>, a level of <u>knowledge</u>, the context of both of them and the limits of their application.

So, even if <u>Plato</u> is “wrong”, which at some level, at some point, in some reality, has to be true, if his <u>ideas</u> form the basis of <u>understanding</u> that allows us to create abstract <u>concepts</u> that can lead to new, testable understandings, then it is “true” until something better, or *more true*, comes along.  For the record, Aristotle rejected <u>Plato</u>’s <u>ideas</u> of forms and stated that all things can only come into <u>existence</u> via matter.  From the perspective of this book, both can be true, as one deals with the world of <u>archetypes</u> and <u>ideas</u> and the other strictly with materialism.  In both cases of *form* and the *<u>laws</u> of form,* there is one <u>concept</u> that simply expresses itself relative to the context of its <u>scope</u> of either <u>ideas</u> or matter.

Although today we tend to think of <u>Plato</u>’s *Theory of Ideas* as an abstraction, <u>Plato</u> was quite clear that this realm was as real as the realm we exist in every day, the difference being, in the material realm we can never know the true form or idea due to the <u>limitations</u> of material reality.  This is the basic theme of <u>Plato</u>’s *Allegory of the Cave,* which describes this reality as limited due to the fact that material form is no more than a mere shadow and echo of the true reality (of <u>ideas</u> and <u>archetypes</u>).  <u>Parmenides</u> (\~500 B.C.) also had the idea that the observable reality was a by-product of an underlying, hidden reality made up of an interconnected invisible network of the smallest possible things that can exist, a <u>concept</u> that was later adopted by <u>Democritus</u> (~400 B.C) when he coined the word “<u>atom</u>”.  These ancient <u>ideas</u> live on in modern theories that describe *massless matter* and suggest that matter itself can spontaneously come into <u>existence</u> out of nothing as a result of <u>energy</u> and <u>order</u>.

#### **Key 9:** Every thing that exists is an instance of <u>archetypes</u>.

Archetypes of form and the <u>laws</u> of those <u>archetypes</u> are the same things.  What we call <u>archetypes</u> of form are the results of these <u>laws</u>.  What we see in our reality are the instantiations of those <u>archetypes</u>.  Before continuing to explore the subject of <u>energy</u>, we need to first explore the subject of *<u>order</u>*, as they are inextricably bound to each other.
