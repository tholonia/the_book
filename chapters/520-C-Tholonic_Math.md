## Numbers

### Numbers and archetypes

We start with 0, nothingness, which, as explained earlier, also creates the concept of somethingness, which we will call *unity*, or 1.  When there exists only 0 and 1, the only possible instance of a value is 1.  There are no other options.  It is similar to entropy in that energy only moves in one direction, that which is the least resistant, most efficient, and results in a more balanced state.  0, of course, has no entropy at all.  For energy to move beyond 1 there needs to be a new instance of a value, and as the only value that exists is 1, the only value that can be instantiated is 1+1.  Now that we have 2 we can create 2 more numbers, 2+1 and 2+2, and they will be created in that order because 1, being *lower in entropy* than 2, will naturally offer less “resistance” than 2.  As entropy always increases, so 1 must expand to 2.  With 1 and  2, we now have 3 as well. We have created the numbers 0,1,2,3 in that order, and have also created the first tetrahedral structure, the first numerical tholon, which can produce all integers from 0 to 11. 

whiel 0 and that are considered  is teh number of definitons, One way to think about numbers in general is to imagine *value* as a conceptual form of energy, and a particular value, like 1 or 2, is an instance of that concept. This should not be too difficult as this is pretty much a description that even Platonists (*“numbers are non-physical, non-sensible things that exist in an objective realm beyond time and space”*) and Nominalists (*“numbers don’t exist outside of abstract man-made concepts”*) would agree on.  As concepts themselves are energetic, they also have stable and unstable patterns.  The concept of *integers* is one such stable pattern that discovered from the stable patterns in nature.  From the tholonic perspective, it does not matter if the Platonist’s or Nominalist’s theories are correct; all that matters is that the concept of *integer* exists, but in the case of integers, even though the Platonist’s ideas may not be accurate, the Nominalist’s ideas are certainly inaccurate.

<img src="../Images/harmonic-shell.png" style='float:right;width:20%'/>One way to consider the progression of values from 0 to &infin; is to consider integers as the most stable pattern for a conceptual form of energy that is represented as a value,  This is similar to how planets orbit only at certain stable distances from the sun or how electrons can only exist at stable distances, or within *shells*, of the nucleus. If we think about numbers as energy, and we accept the basic law that says energy can not be created or destroyed, then we can imagine the number 1 as 1 *unit* of energy where *unit* is defined as the *unity* of all energy.  The number 2 is then 2 units of energy, where both units equal 1, which is the same as each unit having $\frac{1}{2}$ energy.  If we continue this, we have what is called the *harmonic series* of $\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{5}\frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{7}\frac{1}{8}...$ The harmonic series is a fundamental pattern is nature, and of music, which adds some context to the Pythagorean concept that “Physical matter is music solidified”, or the Sanskrit *Nada Brahma*, “Existence is sound” (literally “god sound”) or the legends of Native Americans, Judeo-Christians, Hindu cosmology, Egyptian, Aboriginals, Mayans, Norse, and many other cultures that have a story of sound shattering the void of nothingness.  The harmonic series $\frac{1}{1}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{4}$ rather than 1,2,3,4, (or what could also accurately be written as $\frac{1}{1}\frac{2}{1}\frac{3}{1}\frac{4}{1}$), represent an *internal expansion* of energy which describes natural patterns of energy that are perfectly represented with the concept of integers.  

While numbers can represent many things, they are fundamentally an abstract representation of energy.

Tholonically, we consider the functional value as the archetype of the real value but in 3 different functional contexts.

This perspective explains why there appears to be an exception to the pattern in the first 2 rows of the numerical values.  We know that 0 and 1 are in a class all by themselves.  0 is a rational number, a whole number, an integer and a real number.  it is also the only number that is neutral as it can’t be positive of negative, but it can be even or odd.  Some mathematicians even say 0 is not actually a number.  We addressed the uniqueness of the number 1 earlier, which shares many qualities of 0, and again, many mathematicians consider 1 the source of all numbers.  The value of 2 and 3, the first two prime numbers, also appear out of place as they are in the left and right columns, and not the center column, like every prime number that follows.  

The tholonic reason for this is that the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are instances of the archetype of the functional value 1.  0 is the only instance of its archetype of 0.  We have 0, 1, the primal duality, and when instantiated within the thologram’s 3 contexts, we end up with 0,1,2,3,  the minimum 4 values that every number is derived from. These 4 values are the values of the 4 points of a tetrahedron.

[image]



and from that we end up with 0,1,1,1

we don't start getting into actual numbers, as we commonly understand them, until the number 2, which is the first prime number.  So the first trigram sets the stage for all numbers, but just as a 3 pointed trigram needs a 4<sup>th</sup> point to actually exist in the real world, so too do these 3 numbers need a 4<sup>th</sup> number, which, as was shown with the 4<sup>th</sup> point of a tetrahedron, it must be a number that is compatible with the other 3 numbers, so it must be the product or sum (depending on context) of those 3 numbers.  That number is 3, the only prime number that exists in the center column, and as the center column is &times;3, its functional value must be 1.

## Thologram and Prime Numbers

<img src="../Images/primechart.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>Another fascinating pattern of the thologram is how, when using this sequential numbering system (*Sequential Numbering*, right image), we end up with 3 columns of values; center, right, and left.  For example, the left column has the numbers 1, 5, 7, 11, &hellip;,  the center column has the numbers 0, 3, 6, 9, &hellip;, and the right column has the numbers 2, 4, 6, 10, &hellip;  

The image “*Values based on 2D Map*” shows 2 tables. The *Sequential values* (right) shows the 3 columns and their list of sequential values.  The values in each columns share a common quality.  In the right column, all the numbers are prime numbers or products of prime numbers *that are not 2 or 3*.  In the center column, all the numbers are divisible by 3, and in the left column the values are divisible by 2.  

In this table, numbers that are prime-based are green, numbers divisible by 2 are red, and numbers divisible by 3 are blue.

Because of this commonality by column, we can assign the right, center, and left columns the properties or functions of &times;1, &times;2 and &times;3. 

The table on the left, “*Prime factorization*”, shows this multiplying function for each column and the values that, when multiplied by the columns function, result in the sequential value.  

In this table, the factorials are the same coloring as *Sequential values*.  Primes-based products are green c a 3-based, or divisible by 3, a 2-based, or divisible by 2 only, and a prime-baseells, divisible by 2 based products are red cells, and divisible by 3 products are yellow cells.

In both tables, the numbers 0 and 1 are considered special cases as they are “special” numbers.

For example, the sequential value 28 has the prime factors of 2&times;2&times;7, but as it in the left (&times;2) column, we show only 2&times;7, which when &times;2 is 28.  These truncated factorializations are called the *trigram values*.  They are so named due to the fact that the columns they exists in apply their function  (i.e., &times;1, &times;2, &times;3) that results in its sequential value.  So, a trigram value of 7 produces the sequential value of 7 when in the center (&times;1) column, 14 when in the left (&times;2) column, and 21 when in the center (&times;3) column.

The center point is the first instance, where the counting, or creation, begins from.  The 1<sup>st</sup> instance of a value is then 0 in the center (&times;3) column.  In the *Sequential values* table, all values in the the center column are always, and only, products of 3, so we know that the center value will always be 3 &times; the level of the embedded trigram. i.e., the 4<sup>th</sup> level of an embedded trigram will have a center value of 3&times;4.  The exception to this appears to be the initial value of 0, but as this initial value is a product of 0&times;3, 0 is still a product of 3.

*Note: there is probably a better way to express this mathematically, but this is at least this is one way*

The values sequential values can be calculated:

*3n+(c mod f<sub>1</sub>)+f<sub>c</sub>* for the right column, and 
*3n+|(c mod f<sub>1</sub>)-f<sub>c</sub>|+f<sub>c</sub>* for the left column.

Where:

> *n* = level of embed
> *c* = center value at nth level
> *f* = the multiplying function of the column
> *f<sub>1</sub>* for the left column (&times;2)
> *f<sub>c</sub>* for the center column (&times;3).

The values in each of the 3 columns create patterns identical to the tholonic matrix, which is a very familiar pattern (*Pattern of Variance*, right image, bottom)

However, the right column also holds all the primary numbers, except the numbers 2 and 3, and we know that prime numbers are perfectly unpredictable because we know that the pattern of prime numbers are unpredictable, and if the primes are unpredictable, then the products of primes are also unpredictable.  So, while we can’t predict where a prime number will be, we can predict where either a prime number or a product of prime numbers *that are not column functions of 2 or 3* will exist.  The rule is, any number that when divided by 2 and by 3 result in two fractions is a prime number or a product of a prime number.  This holds true for any number after 4.  Interestingly, by this rule rule, the number 1 is a prime number and 2 and 3 are not.   For the record, up until the early 20th century, 1 was a prime number, but was demoted from prime status simply due to convenience.  Euler, perhaps the greatest mathematician who ever lived, took a more fluid approach; sometimes he used 1 as a prime, and sometimes he adopted the Greek idea that 1 is not even a number, but rather the progenitor of numbers.  This seems the most sensible approach because unlike all other numbers, the number 1 has many faces.

The thologram has the concept of a tholonic prime, which is a unique value that can’t be a product of any smaller numbers.  This is more or less the same definition as a regular prime, but it includes 1, and even 0.  In this way, the first order of tholonic primes are 0,1,2,3, (which are also the values of the first tetrahedron) and all numbers that follow are secondary tholonic primes (which are the same as modern traditional primes).

<img src="../Images/123xsums.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>Another interesting pattern we can see in the numbers of these 3 columns is their crosssum values, or the value of the all the numerals in a row added up, i.e. 123 as 1+2+3=6 (see *Appendix F, “An Unexpected Pattern”* for more information on crosssums).  As mentioned in *Appendix F*, these values, while loosing their quantitative value, expose their qualitative values.  If we look at how the values in the *Sequential values* table change, we see 3 distinct patterns.  The *&div;3* (center) column follows the simplest pattern 3, 6, 9, and is the only pattern that is a single “frequency”.  The *&div;2only* (left) is 2 “frequencies”, that of 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup> (or 2,4,8) and that of the prime numbers 1,5,7.  The center and the left columns together use every number 1-9. The *Primes & Products* (right) column starts with 1,2,3, and then continues with the same frequencies as the left column, but in opposite, or reverse order.  In total, we have 3 unique ‘frequencies’, the 3-based (3,6,9), the 2-based (2,4,8), and the prime-based (1,5,7).  If crosssums show the qualitative properties, then we can say that the 369 is the pattern of *Negotiation*, balance, and stability.  The right column, that of *Limitation* and definition, is an unending stream of the numbers 2,4,8,1,5,7, and the  left column, that of *Contribution* and integration, is the stream of 1,5,7,2,4,8. The difference between these infinite series of numbers, if we add the right column and subtract the left, is +1, -1, +1, -1, +1, -1, and is it this oscillating series that defines the spectrum across with new *N-states* can appear.  You’ll notice this series of primes and products does not start out with this pattern of 1,5,7,2,4,8, but rather with 1,2,3,5,7,2,4,8, but the 1,2,3 is then replaced with 1 for the remainder of the series.  We have argued previously that the first trigram, which contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, should be considered in a class by itself, as it (and its numbers) is the archetype of all the trigrams (and numbers) that follow.  In this number series, we are literally being told 1, the archetype, or tholon, of all numbers, contains 3 *partons*, and those partons are themselves tholons that exist as the 3 columns of the thologram, *&div;3*, *&div;2only* and *primes and products* of which the tholon of 1 is also a *parton*. This is another example of the fractal and self-similar nature of numbers.

This anomaly in the first instance of the pattern is significant in another way as well as it appears in, and only in, the domain of *Limitation* and definition, as it is the archetype, or tholon of 1, 2, and 3 that not only form the 1<sup>st</sup> trigram of creation, but limit and define every number that exists.  

If the concept of 1 is a tholon, then what are the 3 “perspectives”, or “faces”, or *partons* that are required for a tholon to exist? Here we are shown that those 3 *partons* are the values 1, 2, 3, which means that the (tholonic) definition of the number 1 (as well as 2, and 3) is an infinite, self-referencing, circular recursion.  

## Prime Numbers

In the thologram, we consider prime numbers as a part of a larger set of primes numbers and their products (a number that can only be created by multiplying prime numbers greater than 3 together).  This was not done by design. This set of numbers naturally occurs in the thologram in the green dot of *Limitation*/definition.  

The blue dot of *Negotiation*/balance and the red dot of *Contribution*/integration each have their own sets of values, and each set contains $\frac{1}{3}$ of all numbers. Given that primes occur less often as the numbers grow in size, then for primes and products to maintain a $\frac{1}{3}$ balance of all numbers, their products must increase proportionally&hellip; and they do.  Below is a chart that shows this.  

This *primes and products* set of numbers can be seen as either the remainder of all numbers *after* removing all the *&div;3* and  *&div;2only* sets, each of which is $\frac{1}{3}$ of all numbers, leaving the remaining set which has to, therefore, be  $\frac{1}{3}$, or the result of the fact that the total of all numbers that are a multiple of any prime number greater that 3 happens to be $\frac{1}{3}$ of all numbers.  The former reason is consequential and the later is causal, which we would expect if the tholon of primes and products is both a *holon* and a *parton*.

<center><img src='../Images/primes_vs_prods.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Prime numbers are defined as a number that is “divisible by exactly 2 natural numbers; itself and 1”, natural numbers being any positive integer. As previously mentioned, the “exactly by 2” stipulation is a recent addition, and was only added for convenience.  While this definition describes a prime number, it doesn’t says anything about the nature of prime numbers.  A mathematician or cryptographer could explain the nature of prime numbers much better that whatever is said here, but we can at least say that prime numbers are the keystone building blocks of numbers, as *all* numbers can be reduced to a a product of prime numbers, and prime numbers can’t be reduced at all. 

From the tholonic perspective, which considers SAI to be the source of all energy, concepts are an expression or instance of energy.  While this energy my not be in the form of electricity or heat (although a nominal amount of both are required to maintain a concept), it is energy nevertheless, and will conform to fundamental laws of energy.  As numbers are concepts, how can we perceive them as forms of energy?  As we have already seen, energy oscillates, so we can look at numbers as different oscillations.  This is similar to the way we look at harmonic series, and we can apply those ideas here.  We can image the most basic number, 1, as a singular instance of oscillation, or as single *cycle*,  if we use the traditional nomenclature of harmonics.  The number 2 would then be 2 instances of 1, and 3 would be 3 instance of 1, 4 would be 2 instances of 2, etc.

<center><img src='../Images/pp_123456.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This idea creates simple wave forms at first, but that simplicity is due to 1, 2, and 3 being prime numbers (here we take the Euler approach and recognize 1 as a prime number).  If you look at #4 in the image above, you see it looks exactly like 2.  Why not just show a waveform that had 4 cycles?  If we are looking at numbers like instances of energy, we have to apply the laws of energy, the primary of which is “energy travels the path of least resistance”, or the law of entropy.  Because 4 is two 2s, the energy signature, so to speak, is that if 2, as 2 is what creates 4.  Reducing a number to its most basic components, or *prime factorization*, will always reveal the smallest prime numbers that create a number.  Think of the number value as a value of *resistance*.  1 has the lowest resistance, so energy will always prefer to travel down that path, and we see that, as 1 is the only number by which every number can be divided (and remain a natural number).  As 1&times;1 = 1, we can’t create 2 from 1, so a new, unique concept, or waveform in this example, of 2 has to be created.  The same is true for 3.  4 is a more efficient way to express 2&times;2 (shown as 2 thin blue lines which appear as one as they are overlapped), but as 2 requires less “energy”, or has less “resistance” than 4, a 4 will always be expressed energetically as two 2s. 5, being a prime number, has no factorization other than 1&times;5, so is instantiates as a wave of 5 cycles.  6’s prime factorization is 2&times;3, and together they create a new unique wave form (black line).  

We can see from this little sample that the prime numbers (1,2,3,5) and their squares (1,4,9,25) appear to be pure, perfect, or monotone, waveforms, until we get to 6, the first number that has a complex wave form.

Here is what the first 60 natural number looks like using this technique (even numbers = red, odd numbers = blue):

<center><img src='../Images/pp_60all.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The first thing we notice is that prime number waveforms get denser and denser, which we would expect as they can not be reduced to any smaller number, but they also evolve in unexpected ways as we go high and higher.

Her are the first 60 prime numbers (on a slightly expanded scale):

<center><img src='../Images/pp_primes.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Another pattern we see is how exponential values are also “perfect”:

<center><img src='../Images/pp_exponents.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

While these patterns may appear identical, they are not.  The chart is too small to see the detail, but while the form is identical, the amplitude is not.  32 is 16 times larger than 2, but they both has the same waveform.  The #2 wave form is the simplest waveform that remains unchanged and also the most common of all the “pure” waveforms.  

With regards to the 3 columns of the tholon, we have the following bird’s-eye view.

<center><img src='../Images/pp_3col.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

<img src="../Images/pp_interesting.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>Some of the patterns are surprising.  In the higher numbers we can see the more extreme offsets from a perfect cycle of the prime number forms.  This is because they come *near* to a perfect circle, but not exactly, so each cycle’s offset increases a small amount each time.  In practical terms, were prime numbers a sound wave, it would be a perfect monotone that never changes tone, but with varying volume.  #1994 is the only instance (from the limited samples) where the resulting waveform is that of 0.  

The waveform of #1 rarely appears, and when to does, it’s unexpected.  For example, its 1<sup>st</sup> appearance (after #1, of course) is  #1997, and its reverse form in #1999.

*Note: It may be that the correct wave form for #1 is not <img src="../Images/insert_1_full.png" style='height:15px'/>, but should instead be half of that,  <img src="../Images/insert_1_half.png" style='height:15px'/>, which is how a cycle of 1 is shown in classical harmonics.  The decision to assign #1 to a full cycle has more to do with keeping to tholonic patterns.  In either case, the results are quite similar.*

<img src="../Images/num_func_list.png" style='float:left;width:30%'/>If look at the “Right” columns of the tholonic values, we see both the *numerical* values and the *functional* values are identical, and they are only prime number and products of prime numbers.  The “Left” column show all even number for the *numerical* values, and a flipping between even numbers and prime-based numbers on the *functional* side.  The “Center” columns show a perfect progression by 3 for the *numericals*, and a perfect progression by 1 for the *functionals*.  

Each column represents one of the three types of numbers;  *&div;2only*,  &div;3, and divisible by primes greater than 3.  It also shows us that even numbers which are divisible by 2 and 3, such as 6, are actually in the class of *&div;3*, or *center* values, but just happens to be divisible by 2.   

???

T~~he thologram ccteaes a veryt clear case that only three classes of numbers, and those classes happen to fit perfectly into the *functional values* of a 2D tholon maps of trigrams, is not only convenient, but quite validating of the tholonic model in general.~~

While it is true that all numbers can be reduced to a product of primes, just as 0 and 1 have unique properties that no other numbers have, 2 and 3 have unique properties that no other primes have.  For example, 2 is the only prime number that is even, making 3 the first prime number that is like every other prime number that follows.  In the thologram, 3 is considered the first number from which all numbers emerge, as it is the first point of creation of a trigram, and its *functional* value, or archetype, is 0, the nothingness to the somethingness of all numbers.  0, 1, 2, and 3 are the first archetypes of numbers, those being nothing, prime, odd, and even.  All number that follow are have properties based in these archetypes. From this perspective, 5 is then the first generation of numbers formed by these archetypes.

We can see there is definitely a pattern of prime-based numbers.  The question is, is there a pattern to prime products, like 25, 35, 49, etc.  It seems inconceivable that we can’t determine where 5&times;5 or 7&times;5 will land in row of numbers, but, I am not a mathematician.  Nevertheless, given the fractal nature of the thologram, I suspect there is more to be discovered on this matter.

And speakign of te hfractial nature of numners, the following image of teh waveforms of values crated by the firct 16 prime numbers demonstrat exacely how this fractal expansion works.

# Appendix B: Prime Numbers

###### Numbers and archetypes

We start with 0, nothingness, which, as explained earlier, also creates the concept of somethingness, which we will call *unity*, or 1.  When there exists only 0 and 1, the only possible instance of value is 1.  There are no other options.  It is similar to entropy in that energy only moves in one direction, that which is the least resistant, most efficient, and results in a more balanced state.  0, of course, has no entropy at all.  For energy to move beyond 1 there needs to be a new instance of value, and as the only value that exists is 1, the only value that can be instantiated is 1+1.  Now that we have 2 we can create 2 more numbers, 2+1 and 2+2, and they will be created in that order because 1, being *lower in entropy* than 2, will naturally offer less “resistance” than 2.  As entropy always increases, so 1 must expand to 2.  With 1 and  2, we now have 3 as well. We have created the numbers 0,1,2,3 in that order, and have also created the first tetrahedral structure, the first numerical tholon, which can produce all integers from 0 to 11. 

One way to think about numbers in general is to imagine *value* as a concept, and a particular value, like 1 or 2, is an instance of that concept. This should not be too difficult as this is pretty much a description that even Platonists (*“numbers are non-physical, non-sensible things that exist in an objective realm beyond time and space”*) and Nominalists (*“numbers don’t exist outside of abstract man-made concepts”*) would agree on.  As concepts themselves are energetic, they also have stable and unstable patterns.  The concept of *integers* is one such stable pattern.  We know it is stable because it has been around for a while and is well integrated into our understanding of numbers and mathematics.  From the tholonic perspective, it does not matter if the Platonists or Nominalists theories are correct; all that matters is that the concept of *integer* exists.  

~~The tholonic model proposes that there are archetypes for these instances of value, and each archetype has 3 contexts.   These contexts are &times;1, &times;2, and &times;3.   The 1<sup>st</sup> archetypes is that of 0, which remains 0 across all three contexts.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> archetype is that of 1, which has the 3 instances of 1&times;1, 1&times;2, and 1&times;3, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> instance is that of 2, which has the instances of 2&times;1, 2&times;2, and 2&times;3.~~

One way to consider the progression of values from 0 to &infin; is to consider integers as the most stable pattern for a value, similar to how planets orbit only at certain distances from the sun or how electrons can only exist at stable distances, or within *shells*, of the nucleus.  These stable patterns

###

Tholonically, we consider the functional value as the archetype of the real value but in 3 different functional contexts.

This perspective explains why there appears to be an exception to the pattern in the first 2 rows of the numerical values.  We know that 0 and 1 are in a class all by themselves.  0 is a rational number, a whole number, an integer and a real number.  it is also the only number that is neutral as it can’t be positive of negative, but it can be even or odd.  Some mathematicians even say 0 is not actually a number.  We addressed the uniqueness of the number 1 earlier, which shares many qualities of 0, and again, many mathematicians consider 1 the source of all numbers.  The value of 2 and 3, the first two prime numbers, also appear out of place as they are in the left and right columns, and not the center column, like every prime number that follows.  

The tholonic reason for this is that the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are instances of the archetype of the functional value 1.  0 is the only instance of its archetype of 0.  We have 0, 1, the primal duality, and when instantiated within the thologram’s 3 contexts, we end up with 0,1,2,3,  the minimum 4 values that ever number is derived from. These 4 values are the values of the 4 points of a tetrahedron.

and from that we end up with 0,1,1,1

we don't start getting into actual numbers, as we commonly understand them, until the number 2, which is the first prime number.  So the first trigram sets the stage for all numbers, but just as a 3 pointed trigram needs a 4<sup>th</sup> point to actually exist in the real world, so too do these 3 numbers need a 4<sup>th</sup> number, which, as was shown with the 4<sup>th</sup> point of a tetrahedron, it must be a number that is compatible with the other 3 numbers, so it must be the product or sum (depending on context) of those 3 numbers.  That number is 3, the only prime number that exists in the center column, and as the center column is &times;3, its functional value must be 1. 



## The Thologram and Prime Numbers

<img src="../Images/primechart.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>Another fascinating pattern is how, when using this sequential numbering system (*Sequential Numbering*, right image), we end up with 3 columns of values; center, right, and left.  

In the right image there are two tables, *Prime factorization* and *Numerical values*.  The numercial table shows the sequential values for each embedded trigram (prime number highlighted in light blue).  The *prime factors* table shows multiplting function for each colem and the formulas for each value *before*  teh multipung function is applied.

For example, the value 28 has the prime factors of 2&times;2&times;7, but as it in the LEFT (&times;2) column, we show only 2&times;7, which when &times;2 is 28.  These truncated factorializations are called the *trigram values*.  They are so named due to the fact that the columns they exists in apply their function  (i.e., &times;1, &times;2, &times;3) that results in its real value.  So, a trigram value of 7 produces the real values 7 when in the center column, 14 when in the left column, and 21 when in the right column.

The 1<sup>st</sup> instance of a value appears in the center column.  All values in the the center column are always, and only, products of 3, so we know that the center value will always be 3 &times; the level of the embedded trigram. i.e., the 4<sup>th</sup> level of an embedded trigram will have a center value of 3&times;4.  The center point is the first instance, where the counting, or creation, begins from.

*Note: there is probably a better way to express this mathematically, but this is at least this is one way*

The 2<sup>nd</sup> instance is the right column, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> instance in teh left column.  Both are also is predictable, albeit slightly more involved:

*3n+(c mod f<sub>1</sub>)+f<sub>c</sub>* for the right column, and 
*3n+|(c mod f<sub>1</sub>)-f<sub>c</sub>|+f<sub>c</sub>* for the left column.

Where:

> *n* = level of embed
> *c* = center value at nth level
> *f* = the multiplying function of the column
> *f<sub>1</sub>* for the left column (&times;2)
> *f<sub>c</sub>* for the center column (&times;3).

The values in each of the 3 columns creates pattern identical to the tholonic matrix a very familiar pattern (*Pattern of Variance*, right image, bottom)

However, the right column also holds all the primary numbers, except teh numbers 2 and 3, and we know that prime numbers (a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself) are perfectly unpredictable because we know that the pattern of prime numbers (a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself) are unpredictable, and if the primes are unpredictable, then the products of primes are also unpredictable. So. while we can’t tell predict where a prime number will be, we can predict where either a prime number, or a a products of prime number will exist (as long as we skip the numbers 2 or 3).  Any number that when divided by 2 and by 3 result in two fractions is a prime number or a product of a prime number.  This golds true for any number after 4.  Interestingly, by this rule rule, the number 1 is a prime number and 2 and 3 are not.   For the record, up until the early 20th century, 1 was a prime number, but was demoted from prime status simply due to convenience.  Euler, perhaps te greatest mathematician who ever lived, took a more fluid approach; sometimes he used 1 as a prime, and sometimes he adopted the Greek ideas that 1 is not even a number, but rather the progenitor of numbers.  This seems the most sensible approach because unlike all other numbers, 1 has many faces.

The tholonic view has the concept of a tholonic prime, which is a unique value that can’t be a product of any smaller numbers.  This is more or less the same definitions as prime, but it includes 1, and even 0.  As 2 can’t be a product of 1 because 1&times;1=1, a new value is needed, and teh same for 3.  In this way, the first order of tholonic primes are 0,1,2,3, (which are also the values of the first tetrahedron) and all numbers that follow are secondary tholonic primes (which are the same as modern traditional primes).

<img src="../Images/123xsums.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>Another interesting pattern we can see in the numbers of these 3 columns is their crosssum values, or the value of the all the numerals in a number added up, i.e. 123 as 1+2+3=6 (see *Appendix F, “An Unexpected Pattern”* for more information on crosssums).  As mentioned in *Appendix F*, these values, while loosing their quantitative value, expose their qualitative values.  If we look at how these values change we see 3 distinct patterns.  the *&div;3* (center) column follows the simplest pattern 3, 6, 9, and in the only pattern of the 3 that is a single ‘frequency’.  The *&div;2only* (left) is 2 ‘frequencies’ one 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup> (or 2,4,8) and the prime numbers 1,5,7.  These 2 columns together use every number 1-9. The *Primes & Products* (right) column starts with 1,2,3, and then continues with the same 2 frequencies as the opposite, left column, but in opposite, or reverse order.  In total, we have 3 unique ‘frequencies’, (3,6,9), (2,4,8), (1,5,7), a 3-based, or divisible by 3, a 2-based, or divisible by 2 *only*, and a prime-base.  If crosssums show the qualitative properties, then we can say that the 369 is the pattern or *Negotiation*, balance, and stability.  The right column, that of *Limitation* and definition, is an unending stream of the numbers 2,4,8,1,5,7, and the  left column, that of *Contribution* and integration, is the stream of 1,5,7,2,4,8. The difference between these infinite series of numbers, if we add the right column and subtract the left, is +1, -1, +1, -1, +1, -1, and is it this oscillating series that defines the spectrum across with new *N-states* can appear.  You’ll notice this series of primes and products does not start out with this patter of 1,5,7,2,4,8, but rather with 1,2,3,5,7,2,4,8, but the 1,2,3 is then replaced with simply 1.  We have argue previously that the first trigram, which contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, should be considered in a class by itself, as it (and its numbers) is a archetypes of all the trigrams (and numbers) that follow.  In this number series, we are literally being told 1, the archetypes, or tholon, of all numbers, contains 3 *partons*, and those partons are themselves tholons that exist as the 3 columns of the thologram, *&div;3*, *&div;2only* and *primes and products* of which the tholon of 1 is also a *parton*. This is another example of the fractal and self-similar nature of numbers.

This anomaly in the first instance of the pattern is significant isn another way as well as it appears in, and only in, the domain of *Limitation* and definition, as it is the archetypes, or tholons of 1, 2, and 3 that not only form the 1<sup>st</sup> trigram of creation, but limit and define every number that exists.  

If the concept of 1 is a tholon, then what are the 3 “perspectives”, or “faces”, or *partons* that are required for a tholon to exist? Here we are shown that those 3 *partons* are the values 1, 2, 3, which means that the (tholonic) definition of the number 1 (as well as 2, and 3) is an infinite, self-referencing, circular recursion.  

## Prime Numbers

In the thologram, we consider prime numbers as a part of a larger set of primes numbers and their products (a number that can only be created by multiplying prime numbers greater than 3 together).  This was not done by design. This set of numbers naturally occurs in the thologram in the green dot of *Limitation*/definition.  

The blue dot of *Negotiation*/balance and the red dot of *Contribution*/integration each have their own sets of values, and each set contains $\frac{1}{3}$ of all numbers. Given that primes occur less often as as the numbers grow in size, then for primes and products to maintain a $\frac{1}{3}$ balance of all numbers, their products must increase proportionally&hellip; and they do.  Below is a chart that shows this.  

This *primes and products* set of numbers can be seen as either the remainder of all numbers *after* removing all the *&div;3* and  *&div;2only* sets, each of which is $\frac{1}{3}$ of all numbers, leaving the remaining set which has to, therefore, be  $\frac{1}{3}$, or the result of the fact that the total of all numbers that are a multiple of any prime number greater that 3 happens to be $\frac{1}{3}$ of all numbers.  The former reason is consequential and the later is causal, which we would expect if the tholon of primes and products s both a *holon* and a *parton*.

<center><img src='../Images/primes_vs_prods.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Primer numbers are defined a a number that is “divisible by exactly 2 natural numbers”, natural numbers being any positive integer. As previously mentioned, the “exactly by 2” stipulation is a recent addition, and was only added for convenience.  While this definition describes a prime number, it doesn’t says anything about the nature of prime numbers.  A mathematician or cryptographer could explain the nature of prime numbers much better that whatever is said here, but we can at least say that prime numbers are the keystone building blocks of numbers, as *all* numbers can only be defined by as a product of prime numbers, and prime numbers can only be defined by themselves. 

From the tholonic perspective, which considers SAI to be the source of all energy, concepts are an expression or instance of energy.  While this energy my not be in the form of electricity or heat (although a nominal amount of both are required to maintain a concept), it is energy nevertheless, and will conform to fundamental laws of energy.  As number are concepts, how can we perceive them as forms of energy?  As we have already seen, energy oscillates, so we can look at numbers as different oscillations.  This is similar to the way we look at harmonics, and we can apply those ideas here.  We can image the most basic number, 1, as a singular instance of oscillation, or as single *cycle*,  if we use the traditional nomenclature of harmonics.  The number 2 would then be 2 instances of 1, and 3 would be 3 instance of 1 or one instance of 2 and one instance of 1.

<center><img src='../Images/pp_123456.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This idea idea creates simple wave forms at first, but that is because 1, 2, and 3 are prime numbers (here we take the Euler approach and recognize 1 as a prime number).  If you look at #4 in the image above, you see it looks exactly like 2.  Why not just show a waveform that had 4 cycles?  If we are looking at numbers like instances of energy, we have to apply the laws of energy, the primary of which is “energy travels the path of least resistance”, or the law of entropy.  Because 4 is two 2’s, the energy signature, so to speak, is that if 2, as 2 is what creates 4.  Reducing a number to its most basic components of called *prime factorization*, and as all numbers are created from prime numbers, prime factorization will always reveal the smallest prime numbers that created a number.  Think of the number value as a value of *resistance*.  1 has the lowest resistance, so energy will always prefer to travel down that path, and we see that, as 1 is the only number by which every number can be divided (and remain a natural number).  As 1&times;1 = 1, we can’t create 2 from 1, so a new, unique concept of 2 has to be created.  The same is true for 3.  4 is a more efficient way to express 2&times;2 (shown as two, thin blue lines which appear as one as they are overlapped), but as 2 requires less “energy”, or has less “resistance” than 4, a 4 will always be expressed energetically as two 2s. 5, being a prime number, has no factorization, so is instantiates as a wave of 5 cycles.  6’s prime factorization is 2&times;3, and 2 and 3 have different “frequencies”, together they create a new unique wave form (black line).  

We can see from this little sample that prime numbers (1,2,3,5) and their squares (4) appear to be pure, perfect, or monotone,  waveforms, until we get to 6, the first number that has a unique wave form.

Here is what the first 60 natural number looks like using this technique:

<center><img src='../Images/pp_60all.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The first thing we notice is that prime number forms get denser and denser, which we would expect as they can not be reduced to any smaller number, but they also evolve in unexpected ways as we go high and higher.

Her are teh first 60 prime numbers (on a slightly expanded scale):

<center><img src='../Images/pp_primes.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Another pattern we see is how exponential values are also “perfect”:

<center><img src='../Images/pp_exponents.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

While these patterns may appear identical, they are not.  The chart is too small to seem the detail, but while the form is identical, the amplitude is not.  32 is 16 times larger that 2, but they both has the same waveform.  The #2 wave form is the simplest waveform that remains unchanged and also the most common of all the “pure” waveforms.  

With regards to the 3 columns of the tholon, we have the following bird’s-sys view.

<center><img src='../Images/pp_3col.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

<img src="../Images/pp_interesting.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>Some of the patterns are surprising.  In the higher numbers we can see the more extreme offsets from a perfect cycle of the prime number forms.  This is because they come *near* to a perfect circle, but not exactly, so each cycle’s offset increases a small amount each time.  In practical terms, were prime numbers a sound wave, it would be a perfect monotone that never changes tone, but with varying volume.  #1994 is the only instance where I have seem the resulting form be that of 0.  

The waveform of #1 rarely appears, and when to does, it’s unexpected.  For example, its first appearance (after #1, of course) is  #1997, and its reverse form in #1999.

*Note: It may be that the correct wave form for #1 is not <img src="../Images/insert_1_full.png" style='height:15px'/>, but should instead be half of that,  <img src="../Images/insert_1_half.png" style='height:15px'/>, which is how a cycle of 1 is shown in classical harmonics.  The decision to assign #1 to a full cycle has more to do with keeping to tholonic patterns.  In either case, the results are quite similar.*

<img src="../Images/num_func_list.png" style='float:left;width:30%'/>If look at the “Right” columns of the tholonic values, we see both the *numerical* values and the *functional* values are identical, and they are only prime number and products of prime numbers.  The “Left” column show all even number for the *numerical* values, and a flipping between even numbers and prime-based numbers on the *functional* side.  The “Center” columns show a perfect progression by 3 for the *numericals*, and a perfect progression by 1 for the *functionals*.  

Each column represents one of the three types of numbers;  *&div;2only*,  &div;3, and divisible by primes greater than 3.  It also shows us that even numbers which are divisible by 2 and 3, such as 6, are actually in the class of *&div;3*, or *center* values, but just happens to be divisible by 2.   

???

T~~he thologram ccteaes a veryt clear case that only three classes of numbers, and those classes happen to fit perfectly into the *functional values* of a 2D tholon maps of trigrams, is not only convenient, but quite validating of the tholonic model in general.~~

While it is true that all numbers can be reduced to a product of primes, just as 0 and 1 have unique properties that no other numbers have, 2 and 3 have unique properties that no other primes have.  For example, 2 is the only prime number that is even, making 3 the first prime number that is like every other prime number that follows.  In the thologram, 3 is considered the first number from which all numbers emerge, as it is the first point of creation of a trigram, and its *functional* value, or archetype, is 0, the nothingness to the somethingness of all numbers.  0, 1, 2, and 3 are the first archetypes of numbers, those being nothing, prime, odd, and even.  All number that follow are have properties based in these archetypes. From this perspective, 5 is then the first generation of numbers formed by these archetypes.

We can see there is definitely a pattern of prime-based numbers.  The question is, is there a pattern to prime products, like 25, 35, 49, etc.  It seems inconceivable that we can’t determine where 5&times;5 or 7&times;5 will land in row of numbers, but, I am not a mathematician.  Nevertheless, given the fractal nature of the thologram, I suspect there is more to be discovered on this matter.

And speakign of te hfractial nature of numners, the following image of teh waveforms of values crated by the firct 16 prime numbers demonstrat exacely how this fractal expansion works.

<center><img src='../Images/hiprimes1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

shows this very clearly of the fundamental claims being made here is that a coherent and stable expression of energy, in order to be sustainable, must satisfy a number of prerequisites that will ensure its sustainability.  It’s a bit like existential bureaucracy in that if the proper application for existence is not filled out completely and accurately, the request is denied.

Within the tholons are numerous relationships.  The ones we have used in our examples are the twelve formulas that define one instance of Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> law, Ohm’s Law.  If we map these formulas to the tholon using the reasoning described earlier, we get the following:

<center><img src='../Images/111-color-merged-3a.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This shows the four trigrams that make up a tholon, however, depending on the perspective of view of the tholon, the formulas will be different.  There are many ways to view this mapping, but this is perhaps the simplest.  Besides the basic twelve formulas, we also see that the trigrams have two “directions”.  One direction (the inner circle) is the direction of the formula, but this only applies where division is involved because <IMG src="../Images/math/357.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:6pt;"/> but <IMG src="../Images/math/300.svg" style="height:18pt"/> .  The other direction is an arrow that starts at the initiating value, the point of the N-source, and terminates at the child N-source.  

For example, using *P=I&times;R*, we can see how the mapping assigns *P* as the blue *N-source*,  *R* as the green dot of *Definition*, and *I* as the red dot of *Contribution*.  This then creates a yellow (additive color of red and green) spectrum between *I* and *R*, which in the case of these formulas, is where the math functions of &times;, &div;, &equals;, and √ exist.  This yellow spectrum is that of *Cooperation or Conflict*, so it makes sense that it would also be where we you find &times; and  &div;, and suggests that, in this case at least, cooperation is literally twice as efficient as division, given that the relationships in multiplication-based trigram functions in both directions.

You will notice that only the locations that are capable of creating a new child N-source, the yellow spectrums, of the 12 that exist, 6 are &equals;, and 6 are functions, and of those 6, 3 are &times;, 3 are &div; (we include square roots as a function of &times; because a square root is defined as a *factor of a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number*).  If we look at the yellow spectrum of only the trigrams where *V* is the blue N-source, as this is the archetype, we see that each of the 3 sets, or each side, always has a pair of one function and a single instance of another.

<img src="../Images/eq-ti-ti.png" style="height:14pt"/>  Side 1, Side of *Contribution* as multiplication  

<img src="../Images/di-eq-di.png" style="height:14pt"/>  Side 2: side of *Definition* as division.

<img src="../Images/di-eq-eq.png" style="height:14pt"/>  Side 3: side of *Negotiation* as equalization.

This beautifully shows how the primal attributes of *Negotiation*, *Definition*, and *Contribution* continue to reappear in every child and instance.  In this case, we can see N, D, and C attributes within each N, D, and C as **C**<sub>NCC</sub>, **D**<sub>DND</sub>, **N**<sub>DNN</sub>. Notice how &times; and &div; never share a side, which we would expect to see given that they can only interact via &equals;.

Looking at all the functions of a side, we see that we have 3 multiplications and 6 divides, which makes sense when you consider that multiplication works the same in both directions, so we need twice as many divisions to represent with division what multiplication can represent with 3.

If we convert these 2D tholon maps that make up the three sides of a 3D tholon into child tholons, we get the following three 3D tholons when viewing the from the “top” (so we are not seeing the base).  In this case, rather than show the three trigrams separately, they have been joined together and the overlapping colors only show the color they both have in common, so instead of seeing two sides of magenta and cyan, there is only one side of blue as magenta is blue and red, and yellow is blue and green.

<center><img src='../Images/111-color-merged-tip.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Because we have overlapped the lines (and dropped the base), we can't apply the actual formulas.  They are shown simply to highlight a pattern of functionality.  The reader can come to their own conclusions.  

As a comparison, here are two versions of a square model of the same 12 formulas, but even here you can see tholonic patterns in both images (but maybe more so on the right image).

<center><img src='../Images/tri-square.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

##  New Data?

Applying Ohm’s Law to the tetrahedron shows some new relationships.  Readers who enjoy numbers may find this next (short) section interesting.

We can satisfy all twelve formulas of Ohm’s Law as they appear on a tetrahedron, but we can also find some new data now which may appear as useless, or may be meaningful if we know how to use it.  *“There is no useless data, only data we have yet to understand how to use*”  or *Claim 33: All data is valid.*

<center><img src='../Images/092-two2Dmaps.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Previously (and in the left-most image above) we saw how the contribution of red divides the green on one side (right) <img src="../Images/right-div.png" style='width:20px'/> but constrains the green on the opposite (left) side  <img src="../Images/left-div.png" style='width:20px'/>.  Can we apply these same concepts to other scopes, such as electricity? Does current (*I*) “divide” resistance (*R*) and is resistance (*R*) “constrained” by current (*I*)?  Yes, we can, but first we have to recognize that while “constrain” and “divide” have different meanings in their usual context, they have the same mathematical meaning.  To describe the function <IMG src="../Images/math/315.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> as *X* being *constrained* by *Y*, because *X* is being *defined* by, or measured by *Y*, is not inaccurate, as *X* is indeed being “kept within certain limits” in as far has how it is being measured.  We can then say “resistance is defined by current” and “current is limited by resistance”, both of which are technically correct statements.

In the right-most image above we have the 2D tetrahedron map with only *V*, *I*, and *R* values mapped to each trigram, along with the functions (&div;, &times;) that apply to the values as defined by Ohm’s Law.   The gray functions are associated with the inner trigrams, and the black functions are associated with the outer trigram.  For example, Ohm’s Law states that <IMG src="../Images/math/316.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>, so in the image above, all lines that connect *V* to *R* are assigned the &div; function.  The same goes for <IMG src="../Images/math/317.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> and *I&times;R=V*.  Note how only N-sources have the functions of &times;.

<center><img src='../Images/ohm-numbers.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Let’s apply values to these points to make it clearer.  Above is a tholon map where *R=3*, *I=2*, *V=6* (and the implied *P=12*).  These numbers satisfy the formulas of Ohm’s law as you can see by the added gray functions (i.e.  <IMG src="../Images/math/318.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>, etc).  These are not arbitrary numbers.  They are the smallest numbers that represent the properties of each point, mathematically speaking.  Why do we not start with the number 1 then?  Because the properties of 1 are the antithesis of creation.  1 represents perfect unity and balance, whereas every number greater that 1 represents separation and imbalance.  For example, if we applied the values of 1 to *I* and *R*, then the values of *V* and *P* will also equal 1.  The number 1 is unlike every other number.  

> Every positive integer greater than one can be written uniquely as a product of primes  **\~ Euclid, 4th century B.C. “The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic”**

The number 1 is a very lonely number as it stands in a class all by itself:

- It a composite number, not is it a prime number, however, it used to be consdiered a prime numner and not a prime number.  Even 
- Any number multiplied by 1 remains that number.
- 1 is its own factorial.
- 1 is its own square and square root, its own cube and cube root, etc.
- 1 is the result of the empty product, as any number multiplied by one is itself.

In fact, from the philosophical perspective of the Neoplatonists, the number 1 is not even considered a number in the traditional sense, but rather the *source* of all numbers.

So, why not start counting with 2 rather than 6? Because we assume that the children of N, when recombined, must equal N.  We can test this numbers by applying the formulas of Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> and see that the bases of the trigrams apply *multiplication*, and the sides apply *division*, and consequently create perfect inverted replicas of themselves in the children.

For these, and other reasons, we can not start counting with the number 1, but need to start with the first number that represents a *product* of 1, or, a number that acts like a normal number in a practical sense.

There are some interesting relationships and values below.  I can’t tell you what they mean or represent, but it would be irrational to assume they have no significance without knowing anything more about them.  Everything that leads up to these new values is quite reasonable and provable.  It is just a matter of discovering where these new values and formulas apply.  To explain these new values here would border on sadistic given what the reader has had to suffer through already, and as it qualifies as a book unto itself I will spare the reader.  However, there are just a couple I would like to share.

If we look at *current* (*I*, red, 2) “dividing” *resistance* (*R*, green, 3), on the right <img src="../Images/right-div.png" style='width:20px'/>, and apply the function of division associated with the 6-2 vector, or side, we have 3<sup>2</sup>&div;2, which is <IMG src='../Images/math/386.svg' style='height:12pt' />(which we’ll call *R<sub>i</sub>*).  On the left we have *resistance* (*R*) *constrained* by *current* (*I*) <img src="../Images/left-div.png" style='width:20px'/>, which is 2<sup>2</sup>&div;3, which is <IMG src='../Images/math/385.svg' style='height:12pt' />(which we’ll call *I<sub>r</sub>*).  Neither number *seems* particularly significant, but if we multiply these numbers together, which we would because they are connected via the “base” of the trigram, the 3-2 vector, which has the property of multiplication we get *R<sub>i</sub>&times;I<sub>r</sub>*=6, which is the value for *V*, so Ohm’s Law has not been broken.  Using this same reasoning we can apply this to the three 6s, but as they are on a vector of multiplication, we would say 6<sup>3</sup>, which yields 216 (which we’ll call *V<sub>3</sub>*).  

In any case, we have new properties of *R<sub>i</sub>, I<sub>r</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>*. We can now say *R<sub>i</sub>&times;I<sub>r</sub>=V*.  This means we can also say <IMG src="../Images/math/320.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/>  and <IMG src="../Images/math/321.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/>, all in accordance to Ohms Law.  We can also calculate a new value for *P* as *V&times;I<sub>r</sub>=P*, but this gives us the value 8, which is a different value from *P*=12, so we will call this *P<sub>1</sub>*.  Let’s test these values by applying the other formulas and see if we get the correct results.  We can apply the formula *I<sub>r</sub><sup>2</sup>&times;R<sub>i</sub>=P<sub>1</sub>* where we’d expect *P<sub>1</sub>* to equal 8, and it does. <IMG src="../Images/math/322.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/>.

We have exposed at least four new values within the tholon map; *R<sub>i</sub>, I<sub>r</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>*, and *P<sub>1</sub>* (being 1.3333, 4.5, 216, and 8 when *I=2*, *R=3*, *V=6*, and *P=12*).  Now all we have to do is find out what they mean and where they are applied in the real world.

Regarding *V<sub>3</sub>*, 216, this is a fascinating number that has a history that goes back to at least Plato, because we know (generally accepted by experts) that 216 is called *Plato’s Number* and was described to Plato by Socrates who said (when explaining how to properly breed humans):

> For the number of the human creature is the first in which root and square multiplications (comprising three dimensions and four limits) of basic numbers which make like and unlike, and which increase and decrease, produce a final result in completely commensurate terms.

*(The word “cubed” was not in use in those days, but 216 is the first (smallest) cube which is the sum of three cubes.  It also makes more sense how this might apply to human breeding when you know that back in those days, odd numbers were considered male and even numbers were considered female.  Math class back then must have been a lot more interesting.)*

Plato elaborated on this in his “Republic”:

> Now for divine begettings there is a period comprehended by a perfect number, and for mortal by the first in which augmentations dominating and dominated when they have attained to three distances and four limits of the assimilating and the dissimilating, the waxing and the waning, render all things conversable and commensurable with one another, whereof a basal four-thirds wedded to the pempad yields two harmonies at the third augmentation, the one the product of equal factors taken one hundred times, the other of equal length one way but oblong,-one dimension of a hundred numbers determined by the rational diameters of the pempad lacking one in each case, or of the irrational lacking two; the other dimension of a hundred cubes of the triad.  And this entire geometrical number is determinative of this thing, of better and inferior births. 

The above has been interpreted to mean 6<sup>3</sup>, which Plato alludes to elsewhere, as 6 (considered the number of marriage back then) is the product of female (2) and male (3), and 2<sup>3</sup> &times; 3<sup>3</sup> = 216.  While 216 is the most accepted answer, great thinkers spanning over 2,000 years, such as Aristotle, Proclus, Marsilio Ficino, Gerolamo Cardano, Eduard Zeller, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Paul Tannery, Friedrich Hultsch, and more, have all tried to decipher Plato’s enigmatic text.  216’s fame may even go back as far as Pythagoras, as it is the sum of cubes of the *Pythagorean triple* (3,4,5, hence 3<sup>3</sup> + 4<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup>), or even Ancient Babylon.[^203]

Later in history, this pedigree number fell slightly into infamy when John the Apostle declared in Revelations that 666 was the number of the Beast (the beast that comes out of the sea, not the one that comes out of the abyss of the Earth), but also the number of man.  216 might have escaped scot-free if John had not specifically said that the number 666 was to be *calculated* (or *counted* depending on translation) to learn its true number.

> Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man *(ed: or “humanities number”)*, and that number is 666 .  **\~John, Revelations 13:18 (NIV)**

Mathematicians even classify any prime number that contains the sequence 666 as Belphegor’s Primes, named after one of the seven princes of Hell (who helps people make discoveries and seduces them in to thinking they will be become rich as a result).

Because 216 = 6&times;6&times;6, it gained a dubious reputation by association with the Beast of Armageddon and started popping up in some strange places, thanks to humanities generally suspicious nature and love of doom.  Fans of the arcane ignore the most likely suggestion that John may have been telling to reader to *add* the numbers together, because in the original Greek it was penned as 600+60+6, and “Six hundred threescore and six” in the most popular King James Bible.  However, the odd coincidence that John’s number of man (666), which needed to be calculated, has a strong relationship with Socrates’ “number of the human creature” (216), which also needed to be calculated, is curious… even more curious is why these old timer’s preferred to shroud their message in incomprehensible riddles rather than just tell us the damn number! Ug… philosophers.  Regardless, 216’s clout in the religious and mystical tin-foil-hat brigades still holds up today.  Just do an Internet search for “216” to see for yourself.  Coincidentally, 216 &times; 10 happens to be the years the procession of the equinox moves through each of the 12 constellations.

The above example is based on only 1 of the 3 sides of a 1st generation tholon, and there are countless generations!

## Squares and Roots

What do they mean in the context of this book?

What is the significance of a square or square root?  We know what it means mathematically, but how would that meaning be understood in a different context, such as society or law?  The challenge with applying one relationship from one context to another is that without well-understood metrics, attributing foreign attributes to a relationship runs the risk of being very subjective, biased, and filtered through a cultural or moral lens that itself may be very biased.  This is the reasoning behind many beliefs and superstitions.  Nevertheless, we will try our best to avoid those pitfalls.

<img src="../Images/papersize.png" style='float:right;width:40%'/>If you measure the long end of any A or B series piece of paper, such as the standard A4 size of paper, and divide that length by the short edge, you get the square root of 2.  This is not a coincidence, but rather the very clever work of the Germans in 1922.  The reason for this is so that a piece of paper of the dimensions <IMG src="../Images/math/323.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>, when folded in half (along the long edge), will remain <IMG src="../Images/math/323.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>.  So, no matter how many times you evenly fold it in two, it will always remain the same relative size.  This can only occur when the ratio is <IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>, making <IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/> a very self-similar or fractal concept.

The number 2 is especially unique in the way it is the only number where 2<sup>2</sup> = 2&times;2 = 2+2 = 4.  No other number has the same value when squared, added or multiplied (except 0).  Tholonically, a single point is nothing but a concept that has no dimension or form, but 2 points is the first instance of a duality and dimension, making it the most fundamental number of creation, or the transition from concept to form, so we would expect to see some property of self-similarity given that self-similarity is a fundamental property of existence.  Perhaps that is why the number 2 is not only the first prime number, but the only even prime number as well.  It may also be the only number that inspired a murder (allegedly).  We already told the story of Hippasus, but what wasn't told was that along with his other mathematical crimes, he broke the sacred belief that all numbers must be expressible as fractions by proving that <IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/> was an irrational number.  His discovery was declared “Fake News” and he was promptly dumped at sea (or abandoned on a deserted island).

In chapter 4: Laws, we showed how <IMG src="../Images/math/301.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/>, but if we use all numbers rather than just prime numbers, we get a very different answer that adds to the significance of the number 2:

 <IMG src="../Images/math/365.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:22pt;"/> = 0.69314718056

In other words, the sum of 1 divided by all odd numbers (which is &infin;) minus the sum of 1 divided by all even numbers (which is &infin;) equals the natural Log of 2.

We also see the significance of 2 in the Riemann Zeta Function (which we explain and look at in [Appendix F, “*An Unexpected Pattern*”](#Appendix-F:-An-Unexpected-Pattern)):  ζ(2)=<IMG src="../Images/math/311.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/> and ζ(2<sup>-1</sup>)=0, or ζ(<IMG src="../Images/math/309.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>) = 0.

<IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/> is also the basis of the Silver Ratio. This is one of the *Metallic Ratios*, which include gold, silver, bronze, copper, etc.  While the Golden Ratio’s mean is between 1 and 2 (1.618), the Silver Ratio’s mean is between 2 and 3 (2.414), the Bronze Ratio between 3 and 4, and so on.  Here are the first three of the Metallic Ratios:

<center><img src='../Images/ratios.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

*(Technically, the first pattern in this series is <IMG src="../Images/math/325.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/>=1, but as it is not a series, just the number 1, it is not included, but is also based on 2.)*

The Golden Ratio is often credited for Silver Ratio accomplishments, such as the spiral of the Milky Way, facial proportions, architecture (especially in Japan), bird flight patterns, and more.  Notice how the Silver Ratio is the only ratio that can be determined by only using the number 2 (plus the number 1, which isn't a “normal” number, and can also be defined as 2&div;2).

Here are some thoughts as to how squares and square roots might apply to non-math contexts.

When we square something, the units-of-measure and the unit-count are the same.  For example, 6<sup>2</sup> , *or 6&times;6*, says we have 6 counts of a unit-of-measure that equals 6.  The thing we are measuring, and the units-of-measure are the same.  We are using 6 as an objective unit-of-measure to measure something that is essentially subjective.

Why is it subjective? Because when we say *a&times;b*, we are saying we are counting *b a* times.  It says nothing about what *b* is, only that whatever it is, there are *a* of them (of course, this works in reverse as well). How do we know what *b* is? We simply assign a meaning to it.  We say *b=apples* or *b=volts*, or whatever.  The value of *a* is objective because regardless of what the units are, there are *a* of them.  The meaning of *b* is subjective in that it requires a contextual value, a personal decision, to make that assignment.  It may not be subjective in the sense that there really are 2 apples, which is objectively testable, but the assignment of those apples to the abstract concept of a unit is. *(Again, let me stress that in actual math these concepts don’t apply, or of they do, in ways yet unclear. We are simply applying the rules of logic to a non-mathematical context, which was the de rigueur of the inventors/discoverers of math and geometry once-upon-a-time.)*

This is effectively the same distinction between *quantitative* and *qualitative*.  Here are those definitions again:

- **Quantitative** data can be counted, measured, and expressed using numbers.  Quantitative data has an objective agreed upon value.
- **Qualitative** data that is descriptive and conceptual.  Qualitative data can be categorized based on traits and characteristics.

This is metaphorically equivalent to something using its own properties to evaluate its own existence, not unlike the first dot that became aware of itself through the second dot, creating the two states of objective and subjective.  Remember, this is referring to the non-math contexts, so none of these claims have any mathematical relevance (probably).

This is a good place to bring the reader back to an earlier section that looked at the relationship between gravity and consciousness, and, hopefully, the reason why will be clear.  In that section we showed how the gravitational field *g* was a product of *G&times;M<sub>1</sub>&times;M<sub>2</sub>*, where (and these definitions are verbatim from the research paper.)

> G = universal gravitational constant.
> M<sub>1</sub> = mass of the observing physical system (the observer).
> M<sub>2</sub> = mass of the observed physical system (the observed).

Here we have the very same concept of subjective/objective, quantitative/qualitative being used to define perhaps the most fundamental force in reality; gravity.

Can we say that when something is squared, it is the objective measure of a subjective existence?  Can we see these two conditions, subjective and objective, as two dimensions of something’s existence? We know that two dimensions defines an area, and we also know that when two 1-dimensional (lines) are at their two most contrasting position (90&deg;) they automatically define a 3<sup>rd</sup> dimension that is a multiple of <IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>.

<center><img src='../Images/squares.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Although we won’t get into it here, in the tholonic view, trigrams, or synergetics, is a model of energy archetypes, but the cube is a model of instances.  For the record, a cube can be defined by five or more tetrahedrons (one regular and four irregular).

It seems almost silly to state something as obvious as the number 2 is fundamental to the reality of *space* as we must have 2 dimensions to have the concept of space, but regardless of its obvious simplicity, the archetype of 2 is taken for granted as it is one of the most profound concepts to exist, perhaps even more than 1 where manifest reality is concerned.

From the ancient Greeks to modern philosophers, geometry and math has been fundamental in describing and understanding the world not just from a technical perspective, but even a moral, ethical, legal and social perspective.  What follows is similar in that it uses math and geometry to support a philosophical premise.  It needs to be stressed, again, that this exploration is not intended to shed new light on math or geometry, but rather, uses math and geometry as guideposts of reason.  With that said, here is another view of the extra-mathematical significance of the number 2.

Tholonically, 2 is the result when 1 recognizes itself, or reflects itself.  If <IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/> = 1.414 than that is saying that it is 1.414, not 1, that brings 2 into existence, but we also claim that 1+1 created 2.  We have two true statements that are different in means but have the same ends:

- *1+1=2*
- Something that has a *qualitative* or *subjective*  value of 1.414  that is measured by its *quantitative* or *objective* value of 1.414 is also 2.

What is the difference between these two true facts?  We can say that the *original* source of 2 is *1+1* because we can only know the square root of 2 *after* we have created 2, so *1+1=2* came first, then *1.414<sup>2</sup>=2* followed.  That means we add two things that are not 2 (that being 1) together to get 2 and then discover there is a 3<sup>rd</sup> value created that we can use to measure itself by to get 2 (that being 1.414).  The difference between 1 and 1.414 is the difference between creating something (1+1) and the creation itself (*1.414<sup>2</sup>*).  And what is that difference?  It appears to be 0.414 because *1.414-1=0.414* (actually, it's *0.41421356237*, but we'll just be using *0.414*).

What does 0.414 represent then? If *1+1* created 2, and *1.414<sup>2</sup>* describes what was created, can we say that 0.414 is the difference between the *creator* and the *created*? Let’s go with that for now and see if it holds up.

What *is* the difference between *creator* and *created*?  Is it similar to the difference between parent and child? man and god? flower and seed?  Tholonically speaking, there are two types of tholons, that which can create new tholons, and that which cannot.  When a tholon cannot create, it is the end of the line for that form of expression.  The difference between *creator* and *created* is simply *creation*.  Creators create, creations cannot create, that is, not until they become a creator, if they can.  This suggests that measuring the number 2 by *creation* would tell us about the its ability, or perhaps potential, to *create*.

How would we define the concept of 2 by the difference between *creator* and *created*? We can measure 2 by the unit of *creation*, or put it another way, <IMG src="../Images/math/326.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/>.

What is <IMG src="../Images/math/326.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/> ?  It is 4.828.  And what is 4.828?  It is *1+<IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>&times;2*. It is also the *tangent*(67.5) plus the *cotangent*(22.5), because each of those values equals *1+<IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>* or 2.414, or the *Silver Ratio &times; 2*.  It is many other things as well, such as the area of an octagon that is defined by 2<sup>3</sup> (8) sides, each having a length of 1.  Also, the number of sides of an octagon that has an area of <IMG src="../Images/math/326.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/> also describes the volume of a cube whose sides are a length of 2, i.e. 2<sup>3</sup>.

So far, this falls more on the supportive side of the claim that 0.414 is the value of *creation*, or should we say the first value of *creation*, as there are probably many.  The 2nd value of creation seems to be the Silver Ratio:

<IMG src="../Images/math/354.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:36pt;"/>

<img src="../Images/22_5.png" style="float:right;width:20%"/>What if we test this magic number of 0.414 on the number 3? Would be get something equally interesting? let’s see.

<IMG src="../Images/math/330.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/> = *7.242*, and this number also happens to be *2.414 &times; 3*, or *1+<IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>&times; 3*.  Again, the Silver Ratio appears, but this time as a multiple of 3.  So far, so good, but there’s more, because this number is also the ratio of the two sides of a right triangle when that triangle is 67.5&deg;.  67.5&deg; is 22.5&deg; short of 90&deg; and because 22.5&deg; is <IMG src="../Images/math/329.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/> of 90&deg;, it is also

<IMG src="../Images/math/355.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:24pt;"/> of a circle.  



This is fantastically elegant in so many ways, and the recurring principle seems to be the Silver Ratio, which is based in 2.  

For simplicity, let’s assign *0.414* to a variable **Λ**, *upper case lambda*.

We could also then look for the qualities of *creativity* within the original *source* with 1&div;**Λ**, which shows us that **Λ** is the inverse of *Silver Ratio*, or *2.414*.   It also shows us a number of other interesting relationship especially when we map these values to the tholon.  In the image below-right, green lines represent *division*, and red lines represent *multiplication*, in accordance with how we mapped Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law to the tholon.



<center><img src="../Images/lambda-tri-1.png" style="width:100%"/></center>

Here is the 2D map for this above image to make the relationships more obvious, for example, how the lower-left trigram has the values &Lambda;, +1, +2, +3; how lower left and lower right are naturally inverted, and when combined, equals the baseline of the top trigram which also has the values of *Silver Ratio* +&Lambda;, +1, &times;2, or how the central trigram is <IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>&times;1,   <IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>&times;2,  <IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>&times;<IMG src="../Images/math/324.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>, which naturally match the 3 corner values.   

<center><img src="../Images/tt-up-dn.png" style="width:100%"/></center>

The arrangement of these values on the tetrahedron do not conform to Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup>, however, they seem to have a similar pattern, because if we apply the formulas of Ohm’s Law to these values, we get some very interesting values, all of which are the result of the numbers 1 and 2 only, and in one case (<IMG src="../Images/math/383.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:8pt;"/>) we see how it relates to &pi;:

<IMG src="../Images/math/382.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:24pt;"/>

Additionally, if we multiply all the values of each type (the equivalent to *V*, *I*, *R* and *P*), we get the a total value for each group where *R=1*/8, *P=8*, *I=2.230*, and *V=6.309*.  With these values, the formula for *volts* produces <IMG src="../Images/math/307.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>=1, and the formula for *resistance* produces <IMG src="../Images/math/384.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>= 2.828.  These two values represent the N-source (1), and the N-child’s spectrum (2.828), so, clearly, there is an order, as can be seen in the upper-right image that shows the formulas, but not exactly the same as Newton's 2nd.  For example, the value for that vector which is the spectrum of instantiation between D and C has a value of the *Silver Ratio* (2.414)+*procreation Value* (0.414), but if we replace the values with the *Newtonian* values of 6, 2, and 3, that same vector has the value of 6, and as we pointed out, 6 is the value of the initial creation, given it must be the value of the N-state.  In once case, the value is arrived at by adding *Silver Ratio+Creation value*, and in the other, it is arrived at by multiplying a *duality* (2) by the *creation value* of 3, if we accept “from 3 come all things”.  *Qualitatively*, these are the same expressions with two different contexts and scopes.

This value of **Λ** (lambda, 0.414) *might* be a good example of a tholonic *qualitative* value in that it was derived by the qualitative “formula” of *creative = created - creator*.   As we would expect, this number appears in nature, specifically, it is the ratio of the radius of a sphere that can fit in the empty space of a tetrahedron (*tetrahedral void*) created by 4 spheres.  This may sound very obscure, but it is quite critical in the way atoms pack themselves together.

<center><img src="../Images/tvoids.png" style="width:70%"/></center>

Another interesting point about 0.414 is that if we calculate the *axis of symmetry* between the values 1, 2, and 3, using the standard quadratic equation of *ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0*, we get the two values of <IMG src="../Images/math/378.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:7pt;"/> and <IMG src="../Images/math/379.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:7pt;"/>, or <IMG src="../Images/math/380.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/> and  <IMG src="../Images/math/381.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>.  Notice how these two results match the two values in the above tetrahedron where **1** connects to **&Lambda;**, the difference being the addition of ***i***.

Just to show how these same patterns keep appearing, the *axis of symmetry* for the values in the tetrahedron above 1, √2, and 2, is:

<IMG src="../Images/math/377.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:140pt;"/>

**Λ** seems to be of quite significance within the tetrahedral and tholonic relationships.  This is similar in the way cross-summed values (See Appendix F, “*An Unexpected Pattern*”) show relationships between numbers.

## Fibonacci Tholon

The Fibonacci formula and its resulting sequence and ratio is especially tholonic, as we’ll show here.

The normal Fibonacci formula is *Fn=Fn-1+Fn-2*, where *Fn* is a value in the sequence of the Fibonacci sequence.  So, is we start with the first two values of *F<sub>0</sub>=0* and *F<sub>1</sub>=1*, then *F<sub>2</sub>=F<sub>2-1</sub>+F<sub>2-2</sub>*, or *F<sub>2</sub>=F<sub>1</sub>+F<sub>0</sub>*, which is *1=1+0*.  Repeating this generates the Fibonacci sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ,2 1, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, etc… which creates the Golden Ratio of 1.618, &Phi;

If we lay out these formulas to expose the pattern, as shown in the lower left images, we see that each statement is composed of 3 numbers that not only have a very clear pattern but are easily mapped to the tholonic trigram.  Why it is a tholonic trigram? Because it begins with 0, the N-state, and the two children are opposite each other, +&Phi; and -&Phi;, and when added together equal the parent, 0.  We show this by performing the same math in the upper left image, but subtracting instead of adding.  More relevant is how when we start with the same 0 and 1, but alternate the subtracting and adding of the same Fibonacci sequence, as we would, given how the tholons alternate with each generation and iteration, we get the image on the right.  Here, we start with the 0, but the two children alternate between -1 and +1.  However, only the red, *Contributing* element represents an impossible function, divide by 0.  From the tholonic view, given that 0 represents not only the 0-dimensional point of SAI, but the source and totality of all reality, then clearly, nothing that exists, conceptually or otherwise,  can be divided by it.  The closest we can come to this concept is something divided by inftyity, which then equals 0, and therefore equals the source and totality of existence.  

<center><img src="../Images/phitri.png" style="width:100%"/></center>

This is also tholonically compatible because applying the alternating Fibonacci formula results in a trigram that allows the tholon to be equated to the *God Formula*, as explained in Chapter 7 “*Structure*”.

<center><img src='../Images/ipe.png' style='width:30%'/></center>

The Fibonacci sequence also supports another tholonic concept, that of the two types of dualities.  If you remember back in chapter 2, “Energy”, it was stated:

> there are at least two different types of duality.  The first being the duality of *somethingness* and *nothingness*, 1 and 0, and the second being two states of *somethingness*.  

Before we can begin calculating the sequence, we need 2 values in order to calculate the 3<sup>rd</sup>.  These two values are 0 and 1.  The remaining numbers of the sequence are the resulting products of these two initial values.   

<center><img src='../Images/fib-parts.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

The number 1 can be replaced with any number or fraction, and while it will produce a very different sequence, it will still produce the ratio of &Phi;.  1 is just the simplest representation of *something*, and given that anything other than 0, or *nothing*, is *something*, we can say that &Phi; represents the relationship between *nothing* and *everything* (or *any something*).

&Phi; also represents the relationship between all things as well, because no matter what number we begin with, the ratio remains &Phi;.

This is the pattern that resolves the two poles of 0 and 1, which exists within the limits of 1 and 2:

<center><img src='../Images/phiplot.png' style='width:80%'/></center>



However, tholonically, the pattern *might* also look something like this:

<center><img src='../Images/phiplot2.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

As we are dealing with a trigram, perhaps the *tribonacci sequence* would be more appropriate.  The tribonacci sequence is just like the Fibonacci sequence, but instead of adding the previous two values, it adds the previous 3 values, so&hellip;0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11 20, 37, 68, etc., and it arrives at the ratio of 1.83928675521416.  We won’t explore that here, but it worth noting that this is the ratio of the Rauzy Fractal, which describe how matrices (more that one matrix) interact in 3-dimensional space and It also has the curious relationship with the number 2 because when ***η*** = 1.83928675521416 then  ***η + 1/η<sup>3</sup> = 2***.  Also worth noting is how after the original duality of 01, the next numbers are those of the tholonic trigram, 2, 3, 6, the first values in the duality of things.  

This ratio is not really used for much, however, Robert A. M. Gregson, Emeritus professor in Australia, uses this sequence to test what he calls a “new sort of thermodynamics”, which he describes in chapter 6, “Tribonacci and Long Memory”, in his book “Informative Psychometric Filters”.  He begins with a description that sounds uncommonly tholonic:

> Systems that move from edge-of-chaos into a sort of saturated stability as their complexity increases are considered to be a basis for a new sort of thermodynamics where entropy is not always increasing, but the complexity of both a biological system and its connected potential environment are increasing together.

 For the mathematically curious, using 4 values (*quadonacci*?), rather that 3, the ratio is 1.928, and using 5 (*quintonacci*?), the ratio is 1.966.
