# 5: REASON

###### The ability to understand something is limited by our ability to perceive something.  As our perception changes, so does our understanding change, and with that, the reasoning we apply.

##### **Synopsis:** Reason is a universal archetype with local instances which produce order within limited scopes and contexts and is therefore limited to that context.  Human reasoning is limited to, and changes with, human contexts and abilities, but it is in accord with the instances of reason and structure of the system it exists within.  All movement, or “work” within these systems, being self-similar and redundant, is limited by these system’s structure or reasoning.  All movement is an act of energy balancing itself.  Structure and the inherent reasoning of a system’s structure exists only to facilitate that balance.

##### **Keywords:** energy, effort, reason, resistance, cycles, intention

We arrived at laws through reason, and we humans are rather proud of that claim as we like to believe we invented reason, but we didn’t.  We did discover it, however, so at least we can take credit for being doggedly curious.

*Reason* is what we call our ability to recognize the natural processes that arise from the patterns of creation and is the product of intellectual survival, a skill we evolved to give us fang-less, claw-less, slow, soft, and chewy humans a fighting chance in the Darwinian battlefield&hellip; at least that’s one theory.

To be fair, there has been a long-standing debate over whether mathematics and, by association, reason, was invented or discovered.  One of the more solid debates is presented by leading astrophysicist Mario Livio in his article “Why Math Works”[^26].

[^26]: Livio, M.  (n.d.).  “**Why Math Works**”.  <https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-math-works>

In that article, he refers to those who believe math was discovered as Platonists since Platonic archetypes include math archetypes, as math is a form of an idea.  Livio gets into the idea that math is subject to the same evolutionary forces as species.  Math that does not work quickly dies, never again to propagate itself into the mathematical “gene pool”.

The same is true for any idea or theory.  Ideas such as the *phlogiston* theory of fire and Descartes’s theory of the motion of planets are examples of conceptual offspring that were quickly dispatched by the deadly and merciless hand of proof.  It’s a bit different on the social level, where we see failed political and economic ideologies that, although their ruin is inevitable from the start, they continue to pop up because, in the realms of ideology, proof is often eclipsed by belief, hope, power and mass hysteria.

A sounder argument that reason was discovered is that the systems we have created with our reasoning abilities, from plumbing to artificial intelligence (AI), have come to the same design conclusion as nature when faced with similar challenges, such as water distribution, blood cell design, language, etc.  In the case of AI, armed with our rules of reason, it has repeatedly out-designed human solutions by mimicking nature.  These improved solutions were derived by observing the situation and applying the laws of reason that we instructed the AI system with, laws that we derived from observing our reality.  The fact that AI is coming up with solutions that not only exceed ours but are more in harmony with nature is pretty good evidence that the laws of reason are objectively verifiable and existed before humans arrived on the scene.

In any case, both sides can agree, for the most part, that math is the language man invented to describe the existing laws he discovered.  Likewise, reasoning is the process man invented to describe the unfolding order of existence that he was capable of perceiving.  This is a sufficiently satisfactory answer regarding math and reason, but reasoning generally has a lot more gray area than mathematics.

## The Limits of Reason

Reason has been pretty effective in describing our reality, but it has its limits, at least in how we use it today.

For example, the traditional Law of Thought[^27] goes something like this:

[^27]: Britannica, T.  E.  (2019, April 08).  “**Laws of thought**”.  <https://www.britannica.com/topic/laws-of-thought>

The **Law of Non-Contradiction** states:
- “Nothing can both exist and not exist at the same time and in the same respect, or no statement is both true and false.”

The **Law of Excluded Middle** states:
- “Something either exists or does not exist, or every statement is either true or false.”

The **Law of Identity** states:
- “Everything is the same as itself, or a statement cannot remain the same and change its truth value.”

These laws are much like math and have their own algebraic notation: ∼(p&sdot;∼p), F(x)&sup;F(x), (&forall;x) (x=x),  respectively.

It seems reasonable to assert that these laws existed before we came up with a way to define them, just as natural processes existed before we understood them.  We certainly did not invent the fact that something cannot “be” and “not be” at the same time.  We discovered that this is a property of our reality, or rather, in the way we perceive our reality.  If we broaden our perceptions to include the reality that something *can be* and *cannot be* at the same time, then our reasoning must adapt.

A hardcore Aristotelian materialist might say, “The law of non-contradiction specifically forbids something to be in a state of existence and non-existence.  If something exists, it cannot be otherwise.”, while a Platonist might say something can exist as an archetype but not as a material instance.  A scientist might suggest that something can exist implicitly but not explicitly, like the ink drop, or can even be in two places at the same time, as we have seen in quantum mechanics, and a Hindu guru might mess everything up by saying, “The One from which all emerges is both *Sat* (existing) and *Asat* (non-existing)”.

It would appear that the laws of reason depend on the scope of one’s perspective and what one accepts as axiomatic or true, transcendental or otherwise.  How, then, can these laws be preexisting if they contradict each other? This is sort of like the 2,500-year-old Buddhist parable of the *blind men and the elephant* where one blind man holding the elephant’s tail describes it as a snake, and the other, holding the foot, describes it as a tree, or perhaps like the brilliant sculptures of Mathew Robert Ortis, such as “Revolution Giraffes”, which looks like a giraffe from one angle, but an elephant from another.

<center><img src='../Images/016-eleph-giraf.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The blind men and the viewers of the sculpture are all perceiving a preexisting form that is undebatably “true”, but they can’t seem to agree on what it is.  Each of these fine folks can easily define and defend their worldview.  They can all recognize the reality they have accepted as true, supported by the reasoning of that truth.

### Labels and Names

In all cases, before one can proclaim some thing’s existence, that thing has to be named, and something about it must be known or at least presumed.  This claim is not only based on psychology but neurology as well.  We can’t say something exists if we have no idea what it is we are making that claim about.  We see this in how languages form ideas and labels, which become the foundation of cultural, social, and objective understanding.  In some cultures, such as the Mayans, it is believed that things come into being by first being spoken of and named. 

I can say my dog exists because I know *my* dog, I know *of* dogs, and everyone I know also knows of dogs.  But can I say *phlimquitz* exists, and when you ask me what a *phlimquitz* is, I say, “I have no idea”? That would be quite unreasonable, but if I said *phlimquitz* explains the 99.97% correlation between “U.S.  Spending on science, space and technology vs.  Suicide by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation”, then I am claiming to understand something previously unknown and can go about defining and testing the *Phlimquitz Hypothesis*.

#### **Key 36:** We name things according to our observations, and once named, they become conceptual realities.

Here is that correlation, just for fun:[^28]

<center><img src='../Images/018-star-dancer.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This process of understanding is similar to recognizing a pattern in a series of random dots, as in the dancing-woman-in-the-dots example above (right).  I can see a person dancing in that image, and I can easily prove it by connecting the dots.  I am not wrong, but neither is the person who sees an egg sandwich.

This ability to recognize patterns exists in our neurology.  However, predictions either of us makes as to where the next dot will land or in determining the properties and attributes of the dots, based on the understanding of our perceptions, will most likely fail.  We will finally discover that these dots represent no specific pattern through trial and error, testing, and proofs.  Once we recognize the concept of randomness, we can name it, define it, and study it.

Humans began grasping this concept of randomness about 3,000 years ago but named it things like “fate”, “chance”, and “destiny”, and, being unpredictable, it was usually associated with some sort of supernatural justice or punishment.  It wasn’t until the 16<sup>th</sup> century that Italian mathematicians began to formalize the concept of what we call randomness, so it’s still quite a young concept.

#### **Key 37:** Our ability to reason is rooted in our ability to see patterns, and connecting these patterns is made possible by our ability to reason.

God(s), angels, spirits, the Djinn, magic, luck, coincidence, mystical forces, kundalini, chi, manna, out-of-body experiences [^29], etc., are all concepts that many people have a clear understanding of.  As such, they can say it exists because they can recognize it and produce reams of information about it.  To be clear, this is not meant to suggest these observations are, or are not, as valid as any other.  Any system’s validity depends solely on the contextual effectiveness of the reasoning behind it and the ability of that reasoning to produce verifiably accurate statements about it.

[^29]: Abreu, N.  (n.d.). “**Methodology for Investigating the Hypothesis of Anomalous Remote Perceptions as Objective Phenomena.**” <http://cref.tripod.com/tucsonpaper.htm> Science of Self Club, University of Florida

It would be hubris to write off alternative views of reality, given every culture in the world has a concept of some sort of paranormal or metaphysical reality.  Western science icons, such as Paracelsus, Hippocrates, Plato, Carl Jung, Erwin Schrödinger, and Albert Einstein have referred to such realities.  Many cultures have extremely demanding training and lengthy education necessary to understand and access these realities.

For better or worse, it seems that pretty much anything can be a Truth as long as people can recognize it and support it with whatever reasoning they use, even if that reason appears as madness.  We need only look at history and some places on the planet today to see the many versions of truth that have evolved and how dramatically they differ from each other.  For our purposes, we are only concerned with reasoning based on the laws of nature as they are perceived.  

### The Truth about Truth

This raises the Big Question; What is truth?

This is a question we can never answer absolutely.  We can’t speak about the ultimate truth because there can never be absolute proof that any one way of looking at something is the “right” way.  All we can speak about is what is the most reasonable understanding given the context of our reality and our perceptions of it.  What, then, is the arbiter of proof as to whether something is “reasonably” true or not, given our current understanding of reality?

One referee is, of course, power.  When Friedrich Nietzsche said, “There is no truth, only power”, he was half right.  Truth is a journey of discovery that can lead down many roads, while power is a battle for who gets to navigate that journey.

### Sustainability

Outside of that battlefield of culture and politics, we have at least one gauge, which is the measure of sustainability.  Sustainability may be the best test as to the validity of something because its explicit existence alone is proof it exists in accordance with the rules of reality.

Anything that exists can only sustain its existence if it exists within the constraints of its scope, typically defined by its environment and component parts.  A functional balance must be maintained between all contributing variables for the energy within that instance to move in a structured manner that allows order to emerge from chaos.  Energy always seeks to achieve a balance; therefore, sustainability is the measure of the degree that order and balance can be maintained.  Unsustainability will result in chaos and visa-versa.

#### **Key 38:** Sustainability measures the degree to which order and balance can be maintained.

This raises an interesting question: if (high-entropy) chaos is the ultimate state of the Universe, a state where everything is inert, motionless, and dead, then it must also be the most sustainable state as it will never change once arrived at.  Oddly, this appears to be true, but this is also an example of the two kinds of *balance*.  The dead state is the state of *balance* (noun) that has no movement, which is the opposite of the action of *balance* (verb), which is a dynamic and interactive process of energy and movement.  This raises another point: if the dead state of high-entropy chaos, which has no order, is the most sustainable, then order itself can only be a temporary state.  This appears to be true, as well as the implication that order can only exist in a state of imbalance.  So, when we talk about sustainability, we’re referring to the sustainability of order, which can only be in the temporary context of *balancing*, not the context of the *balanced* end state.

All the movement of energy at every level of reality results from energy traveling the path of least resistance as it seeks balance.  We see examples of this everywhere, such as when we mix acids and alkalines like vinegar and baking soda or the more dramatic (and dangerous) example of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide.  After an extremely violent readjustment phase that releases a lot of energy (heat), it settles down to the very stable, lower energy-demanding products of water and table salt.  Why does this reaction happen in the first place? Because the final combined state of water and salt requires less energy to sustain than the separate solutions, specifically, 57 kilojoules for about 4 teaspoons of salt water, which is the amount of energy a person would use to run 500 miles!  The energy that is released is the amount of energy the new solution no longer needs to sustain itself.

The Universe, starting with the extremely violent Big Bang and ending (according to at least one popular theory) as a bunch of inert matter, the cosmic equivalent of water and table salt, is essentially the readjustment phase of different states of imbalance coming to terms with one another.  Reality is the reaction of this adjustment, and like the chemical reaction just mentioned, it will ultimately balance out and just sit there, doing nothing.

When the great Zen master Shunryu Suzuki said, “*Life is like stepping onto a boat which is about to sail out to sea and sink.*” he wasn’t being darkly poetic.  He was explaining how reality works.  The ultimate destination of sustainability, on the cosmic scale, is death.  In our current point in existence, sustainability means keeping the various parts of the “balancing machine” of nature working properly.  In both cases, sustainability means balance, but with two very different results of short-term, or *temporal* balance and long-term, or *supernal* balance.  For our purposes, the sustainability we are referring to is the temporal kind unless otherwise noted.

#### **Key 39:** Sustainability is a gauge of existence, and therefore life itself, at every level of reality.

Pions exist for about 26 nanoseconds, while the most massive black hole known, approximately 66 billion times larger than our Sun, would require 6x10<sup>99</sup> years to evaporate.  Does this mean black holes are more “valid” and more “true” than pions? No, because the pion’s existence, short as it is, is inevitable; otherwise, the forces that caused it into existence would not have done so, but the validity of a pion, essentially the truth of its explicit existence, is only valid for 26 nanoseconds while the validity of a black hole is forever (as 6x10<sup>99</sup> years may actually be longer than the life span of the Universe).  By this logic, we can say that both pions and black holes are equally true and valid, but one’s *truth* is sustainable for a bit longer.

#### **Key 40:** Something exists because its expression of energy patterns adheres to an order that must be maintained for that thing to continue existing.

### Tree of Sustainability

Let’s look at a more integrated example; that of a single cell, the building block of life.  This is high-school biology, but let’s go over it again.

Each of these processes has proven to be a more “valid” truth by being more sustainable than any alternative process.

Inside the cell are two meters of tightly wound strands of 4 very specific molecules held together by sugar phosphates, which make up that cell’s DNA.  These are C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub> (adenine), C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O (guanine), C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O (cytosine) and C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>  (thymine).  They are arranged in a very specific order which describes the instructions necessary to build every protein in an organism.

- In a process known as transcription, a molecular machine first unwinds a section of the DNA helix to expose the genetic instructions needed to assemble a specific protein molecule.
- Another machine then copies these instructions to form a molecule known as messenger RNA.
- When transcription is complete, the RNA strand carries the genetic information through the nuclear pore complex, the gatekeeper for traffic in and out of the cell nucleus.
- The messenger RNA strand is directed to a two-part molecular factory called a ribosome.
- After attaching itself securely, the process of translation begins.
- Inside the ribosome, a molecular assembly line builds a specifically sequenced chain of amino acids.
- These amino acids are transported from other parts of the cell.
- They are linked into chains, often hundreds of units long.  Their sequential arrangement determines the type of protein manufactured.
- When the chain is finished, it is moved from the ribosome to a barrel-shaped machine.
- It is then folded into the precise shape critical to its function.
- After the train is folded into a protein, it is then released and shepherded by another molecular machine to the exact location where it is needed.

These processes, and their order, are so specific, so complex, and so difficult to explain with current evolutionary models that Dean Kenyon, a Professor Emeritus of Biology at San Francisco State University who taught Evolutionary Theory, switched teams in 1979 and went on to be a key member in the “Intelligent Design” movement.

The important point here is that if any one thing in the list of processes listed above changes, if one atom in the C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub> molecule was different, or the “gatekeeper” made a bad call or a thousand other possibilities, the cell would either die, mutate, or otherwise become unsustainable, making the larger organism unsustainable.  This is what cancer is, the malformed reproduction of cells that reduces an organism’s sustainability.  Interestingly, the cancer cell itself can be quite sustainable as an independent cell and only becomes a problem as a community of cells.

For a cell to be sustainable and to continue existing, only one process, made up of numerous detailed steps that must function properly, will result in successful functioning and reproduction.  More importantly, we can’t explain why any one particular option in any step, out of the countless theoretical options available at each step, is the one step that the process “knows” to select.

To put this in an even clearer perspective, using only 150 amino acids, there are 10<sup>77</sup> possible combinations, of which only 1 yields a stable protein fold.  Considering that there are 10<sup>40</sup> organisms that have ever existed on Earth, the chances that a random mutation would emerge is 1:10<sup>-36</sup>.  

In the world of biology, this exponential growth of possibilities is called *combinatorial inflation*.  Remember that term, as we’ll come back to it later on.  Granted, It’s not quite as bad as the likelihood of a million monkeys banging on a million typewriters to eventually produce the entire works of Shakespeare, but considering it would take 2,737,850 million-billion-billion-billion monkey-years to produce the line from Hamlet “RUMOUR.  Open your ears”[^30], how likely is the chance that this 1:10<sup>77</sup> process could happen successfully 10<sup>40</sup> times? For life to evolve (in the Darwinian sense) as it has over the past 4.5 billion years, this 1:10<sup>77</sup> process would need to happen 7x10<sup>99</sup> times per second, which equates to every living thing on the planet today performing this process 7x10<sup>74</sup> times per second! If the vast majority of the 34 trillion cells that make up your body didn’t all hit the jackpot of creating the *same* viable life millions, if not billions of times a second, life would have never evolved past the bio-goo stage.  Admittedly, these numbers may be inaccurate due to their speculative nature, but the general idea that evolution as a genetic crapshoot sounds unreasonable as it is statistically impossible, especially when you consider that your body, which is just 1 of 4 billion species that have existed, has 10,000 different types of proteins (see image of 4 proteins below), each of which can range in length from 50 to 2000 amino acids![^454]

What we call a cell is a collective of components that not only all work together with miraculous precision but which seems to have an intelligence of its own that understands the requirements of how each component must operate with all the other components in order to preserve and maintain its sustainability, its existence.  Likewise, the components themselves, like the barrel-shaped machine and the transcriptors, are also made of components that have the same intentions and decision-making abilities.

Evolutionists stick to their guns and say that all the other options, at one time in our past, were tried, and failed, leaving only the process that worked.  Intelligent Designers will say that this was “biochemical predeterminism”, i.e., the process was somehow pre-programmed.  Both of these answers are just kicking the can down the road, that “can” being the question of where and how this historical record of what worked and what didn’t work is stored along with the knowledge of a rigorous set of rules and conditions that informs the process, as well as how this data is accessed.

Let’s look at a couple of macro examples on the social human scale and examine the serious questions it raises about how we understand it.

### Yagé

This ritual psychoactive drink from the Amazon is also known as *ayahuasca*, *uni*, *nixi pãe*, *caapi*, *camarampi*, and many other names as well.  One of the more fascinating details about yagé is how it is made and how it was discovered in the first place.  The main active ingredient of yagé is N, N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT).  DMT is a powerful hallucinogenic drug that exists in plants (and the human brain) yet does not affect humans when taken orally because of the enzyme *monoamine oxidase* (MAO) in our blood that prevents it from passing the blood/brain barrier, which is a semipermeable membrane that separates the blood from the cerebrospinal fluid and which blocks many cells, particles, and large molecules, from entering the brain.  This is a very good thing, as there is a lot of stuff floating around in our blood that can really mess with the brain.

In order for the DMT to get to the brain, it has to pass through the blood/brain barrier, and for that to happen, there must be something that stops the MAOs from doing their job.  That thing is called an *MAO Inhibitor* (MAOI).  MAOIs are commonly used in pharmaceuticals to help with ailments such as depression and Parkinson’s disease (which, according to Stanford University, are the same two things that tango dancing also helps).

Modern science has known about both of these drugs for a little over 100 years.  Indigenous Amazonian shamans have known about them for about 5,000 years.  Somehow, in a manner beyond the ability of modern Western man to comprehend, these shamans managed to discover that the bark of one particular vine, from over 40,000 species of plants, contained a lot of DMT.  They also, somehow, knew that an MAOI was needed, which they found in another of those 40,000 species.  On top of all this, they had to know to stop eating meat, fish, milk, fruit, bread, and anything fermented for some days before taking the MAOI lest they suffer serious injury and/or death.  Traditional anthropologists would have you believe they discovered this by trial and error, but with just a little thought, it is clear how ridiculous that theory is.

Of the 1,600,000,000 possible pairing combinations of Amazonian plants, only one produces the basis of yagé (it’s actually far more complicated to make yagé than just mixing these two plants), and even then, only when a particular part of the plant is used.  In addition, these 1,600,000,000 possibilities do not consider the variables of proportion or the specifics of preparation.  For that many trial-and-error tests, even if every man, woman, and child in all of modern-day South America partook in the finding, preparing, and experimenting, it would take over 2,000 years, which then raises the question of record-keeping as to what was already tested.  The fact that modern science could even consider such a theory is embarrassing.

### Curare

The chances are astronomically greater for other substances, such as the paralyzing poison *curare* used by South American indigenous people for hunting.

Curare is a poison that paralyzes an animal, but soon after being paralyzed, the toxin is metabolized by the animal, rendering it harmless.  That is essential, as you can’t be eating the same poison you used to catch the animal.  Just imagining that the locals knew of this requirement and then set out to find such a drug somewhere in the Amazon is difficult for modern anthropologists to accept.

Beyond that, there are 172 different types of this one-in-40,000 species in the jungle, and only one of them works, but the real kicker is that the fumes one is exposed to while preparing the curare are fatal! How does modern science imagine this was achieved?

> *Wanadi:* “Trumak! Mojie just died testing that new batch of curare!”
> *Trumak:* “Bummer.  And he was so close! Go and try that again with the same batch… and remember to keep smelling it.  That’s how you know it’s done.”
> Wanadi: “OK!”

On the other hand, if one were to ask a shaman how these things were discovered, he would say, “The plants told us”.  Different cultures who have similar stories might say their ancestors told them, or the crickets, or the bones of a sacred animal, or the cracks in the shell of a tortoise after it has been heated and then dropped into cold water and then compared to the position of the stars, as was the case with the origins of the Chinese *I-Ching.*

## Ancient Mysteries

There’s another example that has more significant implications than simply refuting the idea that life is the result of trillions of simultaneous fortunate coincidences.  This is shared because it appears to be another example where the theory of an *uber* intelligence gives more answers than the current mainstream scientific theory that boils down to essentially “Just lucky, I guess?”, but unfortunately, my limited knowledge of the subject permits me only to raise the question.

Consider the human’s 23 pairs of chromosomes versus the 24 pairs of our primate ancestors.  How can higher primates have one extra pair of chromosomes than their more “evolved” descendants? Because 4.5 million years ago, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosomes of some primate fused together in such a way to create one chromosome pair that did the job of two.  

I say “evolved” in quotes because it may seem intuitive to think that the more chromosomes a species has, the more “evolved” they are, but were that the case, the Hermit Crab, with 254 chromosome pairs, would be the pinnacle of evolution on this planet.

We are not concerned with the significance of 23 vs. 24 chromosome pairs but with the unlikeliness of fusion resulting from a random mutation.

So, our 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome does the same thing as our ancestor’s 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosomes.

Mainstream science refers to this chromosomal abnormality as a *Robertsonian translocation*.  This *translocation* happens in about 1 out of every 1000 babies and is usually associated with genetic disorders and syndromes.  This type of genetic mutation differs from a mutation in the DNA itself or even in the genes that the DNA forms.  This mutation exists in the highest structure of genetics, the chromosome, which is why chromosomal mutations are usually fatal.  Those that are not fatal tend to manifest as Down syndrome, leukemia, and other less-than-ideal side effects.  As genetic mutations go, a chromosomal mutation that results in an evolutionary leap is as likely as surviving a fall from 30,000 feet and landing on the winning lottery ticket in downtown Shangri-La.

Still, *Robertsonian translocation* does a terrible job explaining the minus-one chromosome that resulted in humans.   Typically, a *Robertsonian translocation* is when a part of one chromosome breaks off and gets attached to some part of another chromosome, but our 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome is not simply a broken part of one chromosome attached to another; instead, it is a perfectly functioning set of merged chromosomes.

To suggest that this fusion was a *Robertsonian translocation*, we’d first have to accept that there was one primate that had this genetic abnormality who was lucky enough to mate with another primate that had this exact same abnormality (because 23-pair and 24-pair primates cannot reproduce), and that these two primates, and only these two primates, were responsible for the entire human race, that is unless we also accept that somewhere else on the planet there was another pair of primates with the exact same mutation that mated.  Of course, for this mutation to continue, the children of these two identically mutated proto-humans would have to only reproduce with their siblings...  forever.

But let’s suspend reason for a moment and pretend that it happened and that humans are, in fact, the results of 4.5 million years of mutated inbreeding.

Telomeres are a section of DNA that cap the ends of our chromosomes, similar to tying a knot at the end of a string to keep it from fraying.  Centromeres are DNA segments located between the telomeres, usually near the middle of a chromosome (hence, the name), and they are critical to successful cell division.

Telomeres are at the tips of a chromosome, and centromeres are in the center.  In the case of the human’s fused 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome, there are 4 telomeres, one at each end, and 2 in the center, which we’d expect if we fused to complete chromosomes together.  Imagine taking 2 pencils, both sharpened at both ends,  and putting them end to end; you’d have 2 tips, one at each and 2 tips connected in the center.  There are also 2 centromeres, one at each center of each pencil.  So now we have a chromosome with the *stopping* telomeres in the center and 2 *growing* centromeres.  This should spell DNA disaster, but it doesn’t!  Why? Because, by the miracle of impossible luck, 1 of the 2 centromeres and both central inner telomeres happens to be deactivated.

There is a lively debate between geneticists regarding the origins of the human 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome and why/how it proved to be an evolutionary advantage, and therefore why it was able to spread among the gene pool.  Outside of the mainstream arguments, there is also the hypothesis that our 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome was intentionally engineered by a visiting race that also had 23 chromosomes, and by making a 23-pair ape, these visitors were able to add some of their own genetic traits to the new hybrid they just created.

The question we ask here is not what is “true” or not, but which model provides a better understanding, i.e., which theory has better test results and predictions, regardless of whether it was aliens, natural radiation, or the ingestion of genetically altering edibles.

This same reasoning, I believe, applies to so many of the ancient mysteries that are inexplicable within our current understanding, and not only cosmic mysteries but technical ones as well[^306].  The fantastic details and specificity of the Babylonian creation story (the *Enuma Elish*), the Vedic scriptures, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and other compelling evidence from cultures around the world that speak of other intelligences at play, suggest that mankind had access to an intelligence (and/or an intelligence had access to man) beyond what we currently believe was possible.

[^306]: There are many examples, such as the *Baghdad battery* and other evidence of electricity, the largest stone pillars in the world in Göbekli Tepe, which we could not replicate today, knowledge of heavenly bodies, the construction of the pyramids, and more.  One of the more obscure and fascinating mysteries is that of **Min**, the masculine god of fertility and sexuality, who is depicted as a man with an erection, but in that depiction where he appears to be ejaculating, there is a very clear diagram of what looks a sperm cell, especially given its placement a context.  According to our understanding of that time, it would have been quite impossible for the Egyptians to have microscopes at least 100x in power.  This carving is from 2500 B.C.E. <img src='../Images/sperm.png' style='width:100%'/>

For Western man, talking to plants, insects, bones, or aliens in this manner is usually followed by a psychiatrist’s prescription.  Almost every other indigenous culture, including the indigenous culture that Western civilization grew from, had some way to tap into this organic knowledge database.  Perhaps more importantly, they accepted that such a thing was not only possible but necessary.

Just as a cellular transcriptor has the intelligence necessary to manage its sustainability, which is then managed by the intelligence of a cell.  This continues up the chain all the way to a human being (which is just a stop along the journey, as we humans are part of a yet larger system), it is not unreasonable to presume there is an *uber*-intelligence that manages its components of humans.

Our ancestors called this intelligence “the voice of the gods”, and about 5,000 years ago, we started to create the idea of an all-in-one-version of the gods.  This was an efficient idea and worked well given our ancestor’s worldview’s context and scope.  It gave one name to all things unknown and satisfied their need for a sense of truth and order.  Once named, it was left to humans to try and describe that truth and order.

## The Human Brain and Reason

The American Psychologist Julian Jaynes proposed a revolutionary thesis in his book titled “*The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind”* (1976) wherein he explains that during a recent stage in the evolution of not only our ancestor’s brain but the entire nervous system, we, as humans, had the ability to hear voices in our heads instructing us on what we needed to do and needed to know.  These voices of unknown origin were attributed to the “gods”, and therefore became the voice of Truth.

<center><img src='../Images/019-bicameral-brain.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

>“Who then were these gods that pushed men about like robots and sang epics through their lips? They were voices whose speech and directions could be as distinctly heard by the Iliadic heroes as voices are heard by certain epileptic and schizophrenic patients, or just as Joan of Arc heard her voices.  The gods were organizations of the central nervous system and can be regarded as personae in the sense of poignant consistencies through time, amalgams of parental or admonitory images.  The god is a part of the man, and quite consistent with this conception is the fact that the gods never step outside of natural laws.”[^31]

[^31]: Jaynes, Julian (2000) [1976].  “**The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind**” (PDF).  Houghton Mifflin.  p.73.ISBN 978-0-618-05707-8.

Jaynes claims that a bit before 1000 B.C. (just around the time of the Tower of Babel by Sumerian accounts), the human consciousness was not yet “meta-conscious”, meaning humans were not aware of their awareness.  The bicameral part of Jaynes’s theory suggests that there were two parts of the brain, the one that managed mundane jobs, habits, rote tasks, etc.  (the self), and another part which, when faced with confusing and/or difficult challenges, took over (the voice of god).

> [For bicameral humans], volition came as a voice that was in the nature of a neurological command, in which the command and the action were not separated, in which to hear was to obey.

*Sidenote: What we call the “ego” today evolved out of that really boring and mundane “self” part of the brain, so it’s probably best not to use it for anything other than mundane tasks.*

According to Jaynes, the transition from bicameralism to consciousness (linguistic meta-cognition) occurred from 1800 B.C.  to 800 B.C.  We know this time as the time when Hammurabi ruled Babylon and when he wrote down one of the first sets of laws known to humanity dealing with challenging and confusing issues such as contracts, wages, liability, inheritance, divorce, paternity, and reproductive behavior, to name a few, to the founding of Rome.  This metamorphosis of consciousness ushered in the golden age of empires and cultures that laid the foundation of Western Civilization in areas of art, literature, theater, government, philosophy, mathematics, and even sports.  (*I am singling out Western culture simply because that is the culture I best understand and which has the most information available, and not because I think other cultures have not developed along their own lines under similar conditions.)*

From the days of Rome and the ancient Greek philosophers to today, our bicameralism has further diminished, which can account for the decreasing incidents of people hearing the gods speak to them.  This may have been a “good” thing.  Still, the problem that arose as a result of the gods abandoning us, forcing us to apply reason to challenging problems when our pleas for guidance were ignored, is that our newly developed tools of reason were prone to reject any ideas that we could not understand, which were many, given we were still new at the whole reasoning thing during some very desperate times.  Our fledgling ability to consciously make sense of things seemed to be working, so it naturally dominated our worldview, even if we were, and are, still figuring out how it works.  This was the birth of *human* intelligence (as opposed to universal intelligence).  Lao Tzu refers to this time in our history as:

>  When men lost their understanding of the Tao, intelligence came along, bringing hypocrisy with it.

Still, as Jaynes so eloquently puts it:

> The mind is still haunted with its old unconscious ways; it broods on lost authorities; and the yearning, the deep and hollowing yearning for divine volition and service is with us still.

Hence, religion. 

Anything and everything that did not fit into the highly constrained and “reasonable” worldview was pushed farther and farther outside the box of mainstream thought until we arrived at where we are today.  In one way, this “inquisition-by-reason”, which served to purge heretical thoughts from the dogma of the cult of reason, was, and is, reasonably necessary and useful because, in the reformation that has begun, those ancient ideas that can withstand the tests of our deeper understanding of reason will be resurrected in a new form with a broader and more integrated understanding.

The memories of the cell, the voices in our ancestor’s heads, the wisdom of the plants as heard by the shamans, and countless other instances of “divine” or “mystical” knowledge all beg the same questions: Where does this information come from? Where is it stored? How does one access it?

Perhaps *reason* has evolved to the point where we may be able to answer these questions reasonably.

## The Path of Reason

The rules and conditions of reality we have discovered have followed a perfectly reasonable path long before man could claim them as such.  Sometimes it takes a while to find them, but eventually, we do so far.

<center><img src='../Images/020-planet-logs.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

For thousands of years, Man looked at the path of the stars and came up with various stories about why they were where they were.  It wasn’t until Kepler discovered the pattern by plotting the paths on a logarithmic chart that the reasoning became clear.  This became Kepler’s *3<sup>rd</sup> law of planetary motion* which states *“the square of the planet’s orbital period is proportional to the cube of its distance from the Sun”.* In the same manner, we discovered DNA is a helix because of hydrogen bonds, etc., so we can say “Here is a pattern and the rules that created it ”.

This is not to say everything that the gatekeepers of the Church of Reason consider “unreasonable”, such as myths, magic, aliens, hyper-dimensional beings, and numerous other paranormal, metaphysical concepts, are, indeed, “unreasonable”.  On the contrary, it’s pretty unreasonable to presume they have no reasoning behind them, as many of these ideas perfectly conform to natural law, albeit within a scope that extends outside our modern boundaries.  Today we see planets as law-abiding balls in space and DNA as spiraling compounds, but our ancestors saw gods that showed them the way and spiraling serpents of powerful magic.  Who is to say which is more “true”?  

Historical examples of once unreasonable ideas include electricity, flight, wireless communications, space travel, nuclear energy, and pretty much the majority of the reality of modern life.  These things were considered nothing less than magic and science fiction until we could discover and recognize the rules of how they worked.  Once we found Bernoulli’s law[^32] works in harmony with the law of gravity, we mastered the magic art of flying.

[^32]: Fast-moving air is at a lower pressure than slow-moving air, so the pressure above the wing is lower than the pressure below, creating the lift that powers the plane upward.

#### **Key 41:** Reason is based on the codification of the rules of reality as we have come to know it.

### The benevolence of self-preservation

If our reasoning is based on the world we observe, then this implies that everything in nature, everything in the Universe, must, therefore, be “reasonable”, at least according to the laws of existence, but sometimes the reasoning we have derived from our limited observations is inaccurate or lacking.

#### **Key 42:** The rules of reason are predetermined based on the rules of our reality that we have recognized, and these rules require that any “reason” that exists must abide by them.

Take, for example, our reasoning behind the evolutionary drive for self-preservation.  We assume it is a somewhat selfish, yet necessary, biological drive passed down through our genes to increase the gene’s chances of reproducing themselves.  This makes sense if we see the world only as a bunch of individual entities competing for resources.

Another way to see self-preservation is from the perspective of the larger organism which is composed of many contributing organisms.

Take the example of a collective, such as a tribe.  If the collective is destroyed, all its members suffer from that loss.  The collective, then, has a strong responsibility to the members.  On the other hand, if the members were to become damaged somehow, the collective would also suffer.  So, the collective will both attempt to preserve itself for the sake of its members and preserve the members for the sake of itself.  We don’t think of a collective as an organism, but all organisms are collectives; therefore, collectives *can* be organisms.  Now apply this reasoning to an animal.  The animal will attempt to preserve itself for the sake of its “members”  (organs, limbs, cells, etc.), and preserve its members for the sake of itself.  In the case of a tree, a tree will attempt to protect itself for the sake of its members, which it needs to maintain sustainability.  For example, besides bark and thorns, a tree will emit chemicals that attract the enemies of the invading species, which is pretty amazing when you wonder how it “knows” how to do that.  A leaf will attempt to protect itself with fine hairs, spines or thorns, bitter and even toxic substances.  We tend to think of a tree as a thing that has a trunk, branches, and leaves, but it can also be understood as a collective organism made up of other collective organisms, such as trunk, branch, and leaf, each taking care of itself and its immediate children.

From the perspective of the parent organism, such as the collective, it is worth losing a member if that means it will benefit the collective and/or the ability of the collective to preserve its members.

One example is the cardiac muscle cells that have the self-preservation ability to duck, dart, and dodge foreign substances.  Still, these actions may harm the cells to the point where they can cause a fatal heart attack, all in an attempt to preserve themselves, even though they are killing their parent organism.

Some theorize that they do this because there is a greater chance of the heart surviving if the cells can avoid damage and hold out for the possibility of the heart being resuscitated.  This may be so, but I wonder just how many successful resuscitations have occurred over the past 520 million years (which is how long ago the heart evolved), at least prior to the invention of CPR in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, otherwise how or why would the heart cell “think” resuscitation was even a possibility? A far more reasonable explanation is that the component elements of a person (the cells, in this case) are compelled to preserve *their* component elements (nucleus, chromatins, cytoplasm, organelles, etc.).  Killing the parent organism is not its concern, nor within the scope of its influence, as the preservation of the members is the concern of the parent organism, which has obviously failed to protect its components in this case.  The sacrificed parent organism of *person*, which exists within the collective (tribe, community, country, etc.), will only lose one (improperly functioning) member.  With a bit of thought, one might question whether modern medicine is doing a disservice to the larger organism we humans serve, whatever that is.  I suppose history will be the judge.

In this particular example of cardiac cells, their self-preservation can be fatal to the collective (of the *person*), but in most cases losing a few cells is not fatal to a person.  By the same token, the *uber* organism that humans are a part of (family, society, government, etc.) only forfeits one human.  This is happening in our bodies 60 billion times a day, as that is how many of our own cells die and are created every day.

#### **Key 43:** The most efficient model for a collective is individual self-preservation.

Seeing self-preservation more as a protecting-the-family-of-component-parts makes much more sense *if* we also see that every organism in the hierarchy of life, from cells to cities, is an individual entity.

Just as an entity will endanger its parent collective to preserve its members, a (healthy) collective will sacrifice a member for the betterment of the whole.

This perspective also explains how a person can sacrifice themselves for the sake of another, even though they have no genetic connection to the other person, ruling out genetic preference as is the case when a parent sacrifices themselves for their child.  This would also suggest that our most basic drive is not only the survival of the self but also the survival of something more important than the self, yet still be self-serving.  We see this in cases of honor, country, god, etc., and other examples common in a collective.

You might think this is a trait unique to humans, but this is not the case.  We see instances of this in single-cell organisms[^33], multi-cellular organisms[^34] (such as slime mold, where, when faced with scant resources, specific cells will sacrifice themselves for the sake of the greater organism.[^35]), virulent parasites[^36], plants[^37], to name a few.  In society, this is clearly exemplified in soldiers willing to die for their country or ideology, as well as countries willing to send their soldiers into war.

How is going to war an act of self-preservation? It is the self-preservation of the entity of *tribe*, and the self-preservation of the soldier that makes him valuable to the tribe; otherwise, he would be a useless soldier.   The soldier is willing to fight for his tribe because his interests and preservation depend on the tribe, just as a leaf depends on the branch.  Another factor that is obvious in humans and some animals, and may even exist in all life forms, is *love*.  Humans regularly sacrifice themselves for love of family, country, god, etc.  This would strongly suggest that love trumps genetic survival as the prime candidate for evolution, a factor that should be considered when looking at evolution (but currently is not).  I am not bold enough to speculate as to what the true nature of love is other than to say it is the cause of at least one significant effect: commitment.  This commitment is of primary importance to the sustainability of the child organisms as well as the parent organisms of family, tribe, and, by extension, god.  This raises an interesting philosophical question;  does god need such commitment to be sustained, just as a tribe or a family needs commitment from its members to be sustainable? It is reasonable to presume that the sustainability of something depends on some commitment from that of which it is composed.  

This self-sacrificing quality turns out to be fairly common across life in general.  Quoting the paper published in *the International Academy of Ecology and Environmental Sciences*, “Invasive cancer as an empirical example of evolutionary suicide”[^38] :

[^38]: Ahmed Ibrahim, “**Invasive cancer as an empirical example of evolutionary suicide**”, Network Biology, 06/2014, v.  4 2

> In recent years, a large portion of the literature has focused on evolutionary suicide.  “Darwinian extinction” or evolutionary suicide is one of the most important findings in adaptive dynamics [which inevitably bring us to the conclusion] that evolutionary theory falls short of adequately explaining the phenomenon of life in its fullness and complexity.  This is due to the fact that [evolutionary suicide] is not a rare or special case and that it can occur in the most common ecological conditions.

We also see a less dramatic version of this in genomes, which will reduce their replication rate instead of committing suicide to help other genomes.[^39]

[^39]: Levin, Samuel R., and Stuart A.  West.  **“The Evolution of Cooperation in Simple Molecular Replicators.”** Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 284, no.  1864 (November 2017): 20171967.  <https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.1967>.

As unromantic as it sounds, “evolutionary suicide” is a commitment, an act of love, to the greater organism (not exactly Hallmark material).  Still, this perspective is reasonable and does a better job of explaining how and why life operates the way it does.  

With ideas such as wave functions and the many-worlds theory of quantum physics, the morphic field of biology, the research into hyper-time telepathic communication (for long-distance space travel), self-determining AI, etc., it’s easy to see how what we accept as “reasonable” will dramatically change as we learn how these new processes of reality and life work.

Some may see this as an example of “Intelligent Design”.  We prefer the term “Coherent Integration” to represent an integrated self-similar pattern of moving energy that extends far above and below that sliver of the reality spectrum we are attuned to perceive.

This idea is similar to the theory that was put forth 250 years ago by the man who not only laid the foundation of modern economics but did so specifically with the idea of eliminating poverty and increasing sustainability.  Adam Smith referred to this power of self-preservation in his *Theory of the Invisible Hand*, described in his book *An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations* published in 1776.

> The natural effort of every individual to better his own conditions, when suffered to exert itself with freedom and security, is so powerful a principle, that it is alone, and without assistance, not only capable of carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting a hundred impertinent obstructions with which the folly of human laws too often encumber its operations.
>
> It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.  **\~Adam Smith, 1776**

Applying this idea to society also suggests that the most sustainable practice for the world at large can be summed up in a phrase that is attributed to international banks, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Buckminster Fuller, and more[^40] :

[^40]: R.  Buckminster Fuller, Jr.  (1895-1983), http://mindprod.com/ethics/quote.html; Rene Dubos, as an adviser to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, http://capita.wustl.edu/ME567_Informatics/concepts/global.html; A slogan attributed to Yoko Ono and popularized with the help of her husband, John Lennon.  http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=680227; “A well-known international bank coined the phrase” [states Louisa T.  C.  Kim President of Korea TESOL

> Think globally, act locally

This is easily practiced by spending your money at local businesses rather than Walmart or Amazon, or simply, to quote Mother Theresa when asked, “What can we do to promote world peace?”, “Go home and love your family.”

#### **Key 44:** There is an order to creative processes, and creations are a product of order.

Given all that, it would be hard to ignore the insane elephant in the room rampaging out of control.  Governments are global tribes, and in a healthy system, the government supports its members, and the members support their government.  In general, this has been the case, and by “in general”, I mean to say that there is a slight edge in favor of healthy governments over unhealthy governments.  We know this because we can see the progress made in concepts of justice and human rights from the Code of Hammurabi, to the Magna Carta, to the Enlightenment, which gave us the U.S.  Constitution.

> Ideas of justice and human rights possess a long and rich history.  They did not originate exclusively in any single geographical region of the world, any single country, any single century, any single manner, or even any single political form of government or legal system.  They emerged instead in many ways from many places, societies, religious and secular traditions, cultures, and different means of expression, over thousands of years.  Indeed, they took millennia to evolve, since they always depended upon their specific historical context and what was possible in the face of established tradition and often determined resistance, at the time. **~Dr.  Paul Gordon Lauren, historian, “The Foundations of Justice and Human Rights in Early Legal Texts and Thought”**

That “slight edge” leaves a lot of space for unhealthy governments, as any historian can attest.  The modern world of global access has given rise to a new type of tribe, the multinational corporation (MC), that does not answer to those that support it, nor does it have the support of its members.  The MC is more parasitic than synergistic, but parasitism has proven to be a very successful strategy.  These MCs can wield power more than most governments, and even among the largest governments, they have tremendous influence.  Relative to governments, they are efficient, fast, smart, and expanding a global network at malignant rates.  This is not the place to go into how governments and MCs have formed a sort of global corporatism that seems to be heading toward a kind of digital neofascism.  In any case, this appears to be a very unsustainable system, much in the same way industrial agriculture is unsustainable, as both systems destroy the interests and degenerate the abilities of its members (people and plants, respectively).  Both systems will ultimately fail or transform into something else, but as we have seen in history, it may take a long time to fail or change.

## Cycles & Waves

Let’s return to the concept of oscillations.   *Cycles* are similar to *oscillations*.  The difference, at least in the context of this book, is that *oscillations* describe more of the quantitative properties such as frequency, wavelength, etc., while *cycles* refer more to the qualitative values, such as the medium and its effects, value, seasons, life, animal migrations, etc.

One of the most fundamental concepts we have in our attempts to understand reality and the Universe is that of *cycles*, which is one of the earliest concepts humans explored for obvious reasons.

> Everything that has been studied has been found to have cycles present&hellip;  We do not need to know what this force or cause is - it is enough to know that it must be something.  We then proceed from there to find it. **~Edward.  R.  Dewey, Founder of “Foundation for the Study of Cycles” in 1941[^337] and chief economic analyst for the Department of Commerce during the Great Depression**.

[^337]: For a fascinating tour of cycles in general, browse through the archives of the *Foundation for the Study of Cycles*, which has over 100,000 documents related to cycles compiled, written, and curated by scholars and scientists.   https://cycles.org/.  Dewey’s book. **“The Case for Cycles”** is available for download at https://cyclesresearchinstitute.org/pdf/cycles-general/case_for_cycles.pdf

<img src='../Images/boom-cycle.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>The Big Cycle is, of course, the cycle of the Universe.  There are a lot of different theories about how the Universe came into being, the most popular being that it began with a Big Bang, but we’re not sure how it will end.  The candidates for the Big Finale are the Big Crunch, the Big Freeze, and the Big Rip.  Of these 3, only the Big Crunch is cyclic, causing a new Big Bang.  There’s no recovering from the Big Freeze and Big Rip scenarios.  These are one-cycle-only options.  The more sustainable option is the Big Crunch, as it delivers unending Big Bangs that occur *inside* black holes, creating new universes with black holes that create Big Bangs -   Systems within systems, just like the reality we live in.  “But what if it’s wrong?” is then the question.  It’s silly to think that in 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 years, we won’t have an entirely different view of how/why reality began and/or will end, so whatever we come up with now (or at any time), is more about reality as we *perceive* it, not as it *really* is.  Still, we have some pretty awesome ideas about creation and reality, such as the *Holographic Theory* and the *Simulation Hypothesis*.  Of course, it may be the case that this reality is “only” a simulation, but that does not take away from its cyclic nature, for if it is a simulation, whatever it is simulating is obviously cyclic in nature.

### Holographic theory/simulation hypothesis

This section is on cycles, specifically cycles of creation.  However, the holographic/simulation hypothesis may not be a cycle, although whatever it is holographically projecting/simulating is.  At the risk of wandering off-topic a little bit, this is the best place to briefly review this topic as it is relevant to the larger picture.

The essence of this idea has been around for a long time, probably starting with the first ape who accidentally ate the wrong mushrooms and thought, “this is all an illusion!”.  Its more traditional lineage goes back to the “Skeptical hypotheses” of ancient Greece and the “The Butterfly Dream” of 3<sup>rd</sup> century B.C.  Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou.  These ideas found more form in the “Cartesian doubt” of René Descartes, finally culminating in Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom’s “Simulation hypothesis” theory and book *“Are you living in a computer simulation?”* in 2003 (also a documentary[^41]).

[^41]: **The Simulation Hypothesis Documentary**.  (2018, August 01).  <https://youtu.be/pznWo8f020I>

There are two ideas; the holographic theory, which can be tested[^338], and the simulation hypothesis, which is like the holographic theory for philosophers, and although there are bits of evidence, it seems we are faced with the same problem Zhuang Zhou had:  If we can dream we are a butterfly, how do we know where are not dreaming we are human?  Or, how can we test if we are in a simulation when the only things we can use for testing are also simulated?  Philosophers have their work cut out for them.  Still, as a hologram *is* a simulation, and reality as we know it is already holographic, simulation or not, I’ve taken the liberty to combine them.  

[^338]: “**Study Reveals Substantial Evidence of Holographic Universe.**” University of Southampton.  Accessed April 19, 2022.  https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2017/01/holographic-universe.page. 

How is this reality holographic?  

- **Hologram**: creates images by channeling light through patterns formed by dividing 1 light source into 2 parts; light and the light that is a reflection of matter.

- **Universe**: creates things by channeling energy through patterns formed by dividing 1 energy source into 2 parts; energy and matter.

In this scenario, where reality is a simulated projection, the Big Bang would be the equivalent of a cosmic hacker flipping the “on” switch to their “Reality Framework Server”.  These projections come from black holes with their *event horizon* (the point from which nothing escapes) acting as a diffraction grid (in higher dimensions) for the energy it is projecting to form a “reality”, just like a hologram.

We think of this world as analog, but it may well be digital, albeit with a level of resolution far beyond our ability to perceive (which would make sense if one were designing a simulation).  This diffraction grid can be imagined to be made up of a series of 1s and 0s, each “bit” occupying a square Planck length (1.616×10<sup>−35</sup> m<sup>2</sup>).  To put this in perspective, the number of “bits” on the surface of *V616 Monocerotis*, our nearest black hole “projector” a mere 3,000 light-years away, is around 2.3313x10<sup>88</sup>.  There are only 10<sup>82</sup> atoms in the Universe (we think), so that is a big number, and from just from 1 of the 100 million black hole projectors in our galaxy alone, and we already know of 500 billion galaxies just within our range of observation, so we know of at least 5 &times; 10<sup>19</sup> “higher-dimension reality projecting CPUs” (for lack of a better term) that are all working in perfect synchronization, theoretically.

Even more mind-bending is the possibility that the reality being projected is only “rendered” on-demand, i.e.,  this reality simulation creates wave functions of possibilities that only “collapse” into form when they are observed.  Apparently, creating actual physical reality is a “CPU” intensive task, or perhaps this reality was developed by creators that could only get their hands on a low-end simulator.

Using the word “simulation” is also misleading, for that implies it is an artificial rendition of something that already exists.  It’s more like a *bona fide* creation, albeit one that may have been designed around a specific model or for a particular (yet unknown) purpose.

One thing (most) creation theories have in common is how surprisingly compatible they are with the creation myths of the Judeo-Christian, Islam, Hindu, Zoroastrian, Taoist, Buddhist, and even Aboriginal Australian, the world’s oldest civilization[^42], where cycles of creations are implicit in all of them, and explicit in many of them.  We would expect to see this similarity between radically different perspectives, such as modern science and ancient religion if they were all attempting to understand the same thing.

### What Goes Where?

#### **Key 45:** All dualities stem from the first duality.

Suppose the 2 primal, conceptual, and opposing end-points of the spectrum of our reality are *somethingness* and *nothingness*; that leaves a lot of space for pretty much anything to exist.  Entropy tells us that the probability of where stuff will appear will be naturally distributed along the spectrum in what is called a *Bell curve*, or normal distribution of probability curve.  Regardless of the number of variables at play, the probabilities of where stuff will appear will always tend toward this *normal* distribution.

If we had the ultimate Bell curve between the states of nothingness (high entropy chaos) and somethingness (low entropy chaos), the part of the curve that represents the most sustainable condition of these two states would be in the middle because the middle is the point where there is the least amount of disorder and therefore the highest probability for order as each side will be represented in the most balanced and sustainable manner.  The chart below is a general concept of the idea.

<center><img src='../Images/021-supercurve1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We see this sort of distribution everywhere in nature.  In the world of theoretical biology, this is called *environmental dimensionality* and describes how various biological systems coexist[^43] in whatever scope and context apply.

[^43]: Parvinen, Kalle, and Ulf Dieckmann.  **“Environmental Dimensionality”**.  *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, 2018, doi: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.03.008.  <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29551543>

#### **Key 46:** The most likely and persistent state of anything (including ideas) that exists due to other states will be where the most balance exists between those other states.

#### **Key 47:** Order emerges most efficiently in a balanced state.

For example, the human eye sensitivity chart below shows that a particular shade of green (555nm) is the most dominant color because this is the middle of the range of our biological sensitivity to light.  This shows that the most efficient (most energetically ordered) function of our eyes is the perception of the color green.  The general prevailing view of why primates, and many other animals, are so sensitive to green is because they evolved in a very green world.  The tholonic view is that while that might be a contributing factor, the larger reason is that the visible spectrum is exactly in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum (assuming frequencies in the 10<sup>30</sup> Hz range is the upper limit), with 10<sup>15</sup> Hz (ultraviolet) being dead center, and also happens to be the highest energy light  reaching Earth’s surface.  The entire visible spectrum plus the near ultraviolet spectrum takes up 0.0035% of the middle of the EM spectrum.  This makes visible light the most “efficient”, ordered, expression of EM energy and is why this is the only range of EM radiation that can be used for photosynthesis, most of which occurs in the visible spectrum (between 400 nm and 700 nm).  Dead center to this range is the frequency 5.45&times;10<sup>14</sup> Hz, or wavelength 550nm, or pure green.  Plants evolved to absorb the most efficient form of energy that hydrocarbons could interact with, and why virtually all vision of all animals and insects center around the color green (300-700nm range), regardless whether they can detect only 1 range of color (dolphins) or 5 ranges of color (birds), regardless of what color the environment they evolved in was.

<img src='../Images/Plants_chart_FINAL.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>But wait… if plants should be absorbing green, why do they reflect green? Surprisingly, the answer to this question was only properly addressed in 2020[^456].  In short, the researchers discovered that plants have opted for stability over efficiency, preferring to make a “portfolio” of energy sources from the less energy efficient colors with reduced input from the green range.  This increases the stability of energy, eliminates big fluctuations in energy and reduces “network noise” during the photosynthesis process.  Because the green light is the most energetic, it can cause rapid and dramatic changes in the chlorophyll network which then has to work harder to compensate for the irregularity.  The red and blue light they do absorb is also processed at different rates, allowing for a more flexible and stable supply of electrons to the cells, which is critical as too few and the cell fails, and too many can cause cell damage.  

It’s kind of like the opposite of how certain countries which are abandoning the stability of fossil fuels to move to “green” energy have discovered that when there is no wind and/or sun, there is no energy, which not only stresses their energy infrastructure, but attempts to compensate their energy supply ends up creating a larger carbon foot print than if they hadn’t gone “green” to begin with.  If only people were as clever as plants.  

You might think that the blue light, which has more energy than green light, would have the same effect, but the green light can penetrate much deeper into the plant that the blue light, making green light the far more efficient transmitter of energy.  The cells in our eyes, which send signals to the brain,  do not have the same demands as the chloroplasts in plants, which convert light into chemical energy, so there is no need for such advanced stabilizing processes.

Color sensitivity is not to be confused with confused with eye “machinery”,  such as the eagle’s built-in telephoto lenses due to a deep fovea, however, the mantis shrimp has the ability ability to auto-adjust its eye’s sensitivity to different wavelengths.  

Efficiency is contextual.  An excellent example of contextual evolution was found in the Movile Caves in Romania.  These caves were sealed off 5,000,000 years ago, yet within the hostile environment, rich in hydrogen sulfide gas and sulfuric acid, at least 33 new species of life have evolved and flourished, feeding off the bacteria that eat rocks and other inorganic material (*chemosynthetic bacteria*).

*Note: in the chart above, the maximum frequency listed, 10<sup>30</sup> cycles per second (cps), comes from the fastest gamma ray ever recorded and was detected on Sept 16, 2008.  It came from a mega-super-nova some 12 billion light years away, which is to say this mega-super-nova happened 12 billion years ago when the Universe was about 1.5 billion years old.  The gamma rays were moving at 99.9999% of the speed of light, suggesting that 10<sup>30</sup> cps is getting close to the upper limit of the maximum end of the spectrum.*

The oscillations between 2 states, be they the 2 states of chaos, order and disorder, movement and stillness, or any 2 points that are different yet can form an interaction, is the most basic form of energetic expression in all the orders of creation.  On this point, metaphysics, spirituality, and science all happily converge: everything exists in a duality of some sort, or at least that is how we can describe everything.

Were this duality to no longer exist in a state of imbalance or difference, the cycles of creation, nature, the movements of the Universe, would also cease.  Nature is the balancing in these imbalances between systems across all scopes, all the way down (or up) to the first act of imbalance/balancing.

### Waves

Waves are an expression of cycles.  When we look at simple waves, such as light, radio, and sound waves, we see an oscillating movement of energy over time.

On the atomic level, there are electromagnetic waves, such as light, X-rays, radio waves, etc.  On the material level, we have mechanical waves, such as sound waves.  On the organic level and beyond (planets, life, culture, politics, etc.[^44]), we don’t use the term *waves*.  Instead, we call them *cycles*, representing the same thing as waves but in a different context and scope.

<center><img src='../Images/023-sinewave.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Concepts of *frequency* and *wavelength* are typically terms we use to describe these waves of radiation and vibration.  Let’s look at a typical wave model, which is one cycle of a quantity of energy moving over a period of time.  We say that the time it takes to complete one cycle is the frequency, and the distance it covers in one cycle is the wavelength.  We *could* say the moon has a wavelength of about 50 million km, with a frequency of 0.00599584916 Hz, or that the migration cycle of the Arctic Tern, a bird that flies back and forth between the Arctic and the Antarctic every year, has a frequency of 1/yr., with a wavelength of 70,000 km (which is how far they travel every year).  We don’t because it’s cumbersome, non-intuitive, and contextually confusing.

As meaningless as these terms are for such cases, it does not take away from the idea that these natural cycles are the expressions of the same law that light waves operate under in the transference of energy, but on a different level of expression, on a higher order of complexity, size and dependency where instead of photons we have birds and planets.

Another example might be the interdependent cycles of cohabiting rabbits and coyotes.  It might sound ridiculous to compare X-rays with prey-predator cycles, but both share the most basic function, the transference of energy in an attempt to create balance, just in two very different scopes and contexts.

<center><img src='../Images/024-predcycle.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

### Not Just a Cycle

There may be more to waves than just a simple periodic cycle, at least in how it interacts with their environment.  For example, when we take a wavelength that is the circumference of the world and map it across the equator, we find an inordinate number of cultural artifacts representing incredible advances for the time, stretching over 7,000 years.  More than that, there has been a lot of speculation and research[^45] into why the Great Pyramid and Macchupicchu, or the Nazca Lines and Easter Island, fall within this same line (in the image below) to within less than one-tenth of 1 degree of latitude.  Some other locations, such as Persepolis, Mohenjo Daro, Petra, Ur, and the temples at Angkor Wat, fall within 1 degree.  It’s almost as if the inhabitants of Earth unconsciously knew something that had some relationship with a wavelength the size of the planet they lived on.  Could it be the case that Earth’s inhabitants are moved by this wavelength of Earth similar to how sand is moved on a vibrating surface to form patterns?

[^45]: **“Exploring Geographic and Geometric Relationships Along a Line of Ancient Sites Around the World”** <https://grahamhancock.com/geographic-geometric-relationships-alisonj

<center><img src='../Images/world-sine.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The two most common classes of waves are electromagnetic (subatomic particles) and mechanical (particles, M-waves).  If we were to compare them, we would see similarities that we could also identify in cycles, such as those mentioned here, but that is beyond the scope of this book as it would be a book itself.  We can at least compare the properties of the 2 common classes of waves.

<center><img src='../Images/waves.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Yes, for all physicists and electrical/mechanical engineers that might be reading this with extreme incredulity, there are many differences between electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical (M) waves.  We would expect energy to express its movement quite differently when operating under the laws of subatomic particles than that of matter.  Still, there will be many analogous parallels between the two.

To put their contexts and scopes in perspective, consider that an electron is 100 million times smaller than an atom, and 20 trillion times smaller than a chromosome, let alone the sizes we are talking about for typical M-wave medium, like things you can hold in your hand.  Compare that to the Milky Way galaxy, which is 167,256,410 times the size of our solar system, and Earth is only 1/38000 the size of that.  The difference between an electron and a beach ball is about the same difference between a beach ball and the entire galaxy.  With that in mind, consider that the ratio of the actual Universe compared to the observable Universe is equivalent to an atom compared to the observable universe.  It’s easy to imagine how a fundamental law might be expressed differently at these different scales.

<center><img src='../Images/025-beachball.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The similarities are more important than the differences, such as how energy travels through a medium via waves.  All forms of energy are simply a redirection of energy from one state to another, as energy is neither created nor destroyed.  This is the 1<sup>st</sup> law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy.  We have identified many forms of energy: sound, chemical, radiant, electrical, atomic, mechanical, elastic, ionization, gravitational, and dark-energy (that’s the energy causing the Universe to expand faster than we think it should), so is it unreasonable to imagine still more forms of energy? Are emotions like love or fear, desires, thoughts, or even imagination a redirection of energy? And what form does that energy take? Can we say that we know of every type of medium and cycle and the laws that control them? I don’t think so, but we can begin exploring by applying the fundamental laws of energy and cycles.

We can only recognize energy as one form or another, not as pure energy itself.  An everyday example of this is that you can’t see or detect light until the light energy hits something, like a detector, a dust particle, or the optical cell in your eye.  The same is true for electricity, and all other forms of energy.  The real mind-bender here is that the dust particle, and all mass, is also energy, but in a different form, as we have been shown with *m=E/c<sup>2</sup>*.  This means we can only see energy when that energy interacts with another form of itself.  Energy alone is like a black hole&hellip; we can’t see it, but we can see its effects on its environment.  Because of these effects, we can say that energy creates sustainable patterns, interacts with other forms of energy, and must oscillate in some medium. 
#### **Key 48:** We can only see the interactions of energy and not the energy itself.

What about the energy that does not oscillate? Is there such a thing as a 0 Hz frequency energy?  Yes.  It’s called *direct current* (DC) electricity, and it is the most common in nature; lightning, static electricity, bio-luminescence, solar particles, etc., but the electrons that transfer that energy *do* have frequencies, as both waves and particles.  Plus, the energy being transferred and the electrons that are transferring it are certainly traveling in a cycle, for if they were not being returned to the source and recycled, not only would the current end, the circuit would run out of electrons.  While AC is caused by electrons staying in one place and jiggling back and forth 60 times a second (in the U.S.), passing a charge down the wire close to the speed-of-light, the force of DC is always in the same direction, like a river.  While it is passing the current along at the speed-of-light, the electrons are also being dragged down the wire at about 3 miles per hour, which is the speed at which they return to the source.  That cycle is slow, big, and fundamental pattern in how nature functions.
*Alternating current* (AC)  is quite rare in nature, although AC does technically exist as the planet’s magnetic fields flip.  e.g., the Earth’s magnetic field has reversed 171 times in the last 71 million years, and the Sun’s magnetic field flips every 11 years.  The AC form of electricity was only recently invented by the Frenchman *Hippolyte Pixii* in 1832 and popularized by Nicola Tesla, creating a new scope and context of energy design by and for humans.

Pure energy, theoretically, would either have to have a frequency of &infin with a wavelength of 0 or a wavelength of &infin; and a frequency of 0.  Energy with a wavelength of 0 is energy that never moved in space-time, so we won’t be seeing much of that.  However, DC energy is virtually energy whose cycle has a wavelength of &infin; and a frequency of 0 Hz, but within a system that still moves in a cycle, making DC energy not only nature’s #1 choice of energy distribution but as close to pure energy as can exist.  Of course, in actual reality, there is no such thing as an absolute 0 Hz, just frequencies that are really, really close to 0 Hz

We do not have words for many things as we have yet recognized them and therefore can’t describe them, measure them, or even identify them.  It is not just reasonable to speculate that in the realm of ideas and archetypes, there are also cycles and a medium that are entirely new to us; it’s pretty unreasonable not to, as they, too, are an expression of energy.

The real question regarding energy is, “What *is* energy?” Surely the answer to this question would shed light on the very purpose and meaning of existence, as everything that *is* is energy.  Fortunately, the culmination of thousands of years of research and investigation into the greatest mystery of all time has provided an answer, and here it is:

> Energy is the ability to perform work

Were you expecting something a bit more&hellip; profound? Well, stand in line.  This definition is like defining a cat as “*the ability to reduce mouse population*”.  Both definitions say what the subject *can* do but says nothing about what it *is*.  There are many kinds of energy, such as kinetic, potential, thermodynamic, metabolic, etc.  We know how to measure it, how it acts, and that it can’t be created or destroyed.  Energy is like the proverbial duck; we know how it looks, quacks, and walks, but we have no idea what a ”duck” is.  With this definition, the answer to “What is phlimquitz?” is “the ability to increase suicides by increasing the federal space technology budget”.

As far as science is concerned, energy is simply a value that equates to movement, which is fine for the physical sciences, but not for understanding the mechanics of awareness, which is the point of this book (and which we’ll get to very soon).

We can expand on this by pointing out that ordered systems “work” more efficiently than chaotic systems.  Chaotic systems do not synchronize with any other system[^375], so, like the Las Vegas of energy, any “work” performed in a chaotic system stays in that system (for the most part).  Ordered systems synchronize well, so “work” is more easily distributed between systems, allowing for a much wider energy distribution.  This irony that chaos is facilitated by order was mentioned previously but is worth repeating: 

[^375]:Louis M.  Pecora, Thomas L.  Carroll, “**Synchronization of chaotic systems**”, 2015, Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4917383

> Low entropy chaos creates order to better distribute energy, resulting in high entropy chaos.  

#### **Key 49:** A high state of order distributes more “work”.

### Work

Refining the concept of “work” may seem like an odd segue at this point, but now that it has been brought up, let’s be clear about what this means.

In a physical sense, “work” is anything that can be measured in joules (or calories) because “work” is defined as “using force to move something,”… period.  That something might be atoms, molecules, muscles, bricks, neurons, or anything that *can* move, regardless of why such things are being moved.  From a physics perspective, building the Taj Mahal and creating the world’s largest garbage landfill is the same regarding the work involved if they both burned the same number of calories.  The amount of work, in calories, expended in the full-time effort for an entire year on solving the quantum theory of gravity is equal to 2 cups of tuna salad or the equivalent of jogging less than 2 blocks a day[^339].

[^339]: Based on the fact that the brain burns ~13 calories an hour, and intense thinking only uses 5% of that energy, so 13&times;200 hours a year=2,600 calories, and 1/2 cup of tuna salad is 700 calories.

The issue is that “work” is measured only in quantitative values, which cares nothing about the qualitative values of that work.  This is fine when optimizing a steam engine but not when applied to the real world, where quality is just as important as quantity, if not more so.  Where humans are concerned, quality requires intention.  One must *intend* to create something beautiful, like the Taj Mahal, as it won’t happen by accident.

Let’s see if we can translate our energy concepts into the realms of effort and intentions.  For example, we all understand the concept of *resistance* in our daily lives, which is anything that makes whatever we are attempting to do more difficult (usually measured in time, money, or aggravation). *Volts*, or potential, is also easy to equate, as we are (hopefully) aware that we can probably lift 100 lbs.  but not 500 lbs., as doing so will most definitely “short circuit” your back.  The same goes for *current*, which is more like stamina.  You can’t lift a 500 lb.  stone, but you can probably lift a 5 lb.  stone 100 times.  It’s not that far a stretch to relate physical work with electrical work, as in both cases, the work can be measured in joules, but in the realm of human will, and conscious intentions, these definitions get a bit more abstract as we have no idea how to measure such things.

An example of this might be the effort it takes to quit smoking. “Effort”, in this context, captures the concept of work as well as intention, but in a totally different context.  It takes a lot of effort to quit smoking, but 0 calories and 0 additional energy, as we usually define that word.  With this definition, the technical meaning of entropy is useless, as no scientific instrument can measure intention or will, but the concept is still valid.  Entropy in this context of effort is “the amount of effort not available for use”, or simply “lack of effort”.

How can we measure something subjective, especially something already so abstract, like entropy?  If you ask me which I would prefer to do, dig a trench for 6 hours or listen to a 1-hour lecture on *Post-modern Fashion in Appalachia*, I’d be digging before you could say “in Berkeley”.  I’d rather expend an additional 10,000,000 joules (2390 calories) shoveling dirt than sitting in a lecture hall feeling tortured.  Here, the “path of least resistance” is far more thermodynamically inefficient, but that’s just for me.  Someone else would be tickled pink to attend such a lecture (I assume).  However, if energy must always travel the path of least resistance, then one can only presume that the non-thermodynamic energy I am conserving by not having to listen to that lecture is greater than the thermodynamic energy I am losing shoveling dirt.  Whatever that energy is, science can’t measure, and what science can’t measure, science ignores.  One way it *could* be quasi-measured is to ask what the limit of shoveling is before I choose the lecture.  If I draw the line at 6.5 hours of shoveling, then I must feel the lecture will “cost” no more than the psychological equivalent of 10,000,000 joules, whatever that is (psycho-joules? Calories of aggravation?), but even then, that value could change at any moment, for any, or no reason, depending on my state of mind of how much wine I drank at dinner.

Pressure, difference, order, movement, and pattern, are low entropy states or states that require effort to maintain.  We can now add the more qualitative concepts of moderation, control, command, discipline, and determination to this category.  Dispersion, disorder, and stillness are all high entropy states or states that require little effort, as do the qualitative states of indecision, apathy, doubt, flexibility, irresolution, and weakness.  Microstates, or the number of possible configurations of how energy can move between two (or more) states, remain the same in concept but as it applies to effort and in the context of that effort.  How many ways can the “system” of *you* expend effort towards when you have the intention to address a specific issue?  For example, how many ways can you quit smoking, learn piano, lose weight, kill mosquitoes, write a poem, etc?  

Take one example, such as losing weight, of which there are at least 29 ways to accomplish[^340].  Some people will choose one way, and others will choose other ways.  This is similar to how the quanta use different paths to distribute themselves among bonds.  In North America, the most popular way to lose weight, and the way chosen by 60% of dieters (according to Nielsen Global Health & Wellness Survey), is to change their diet away from fatty and processed foods and more towards natural, fresh foods.  We might then surmise that this microstate is the one that represents the balanced exchange of, or application of, effort.  Obviously, a major difference is that humans, and all living things, can select many microstates at once, unlike quanta, which can only select one.  Still, the probability curve will remain the same if we consider a living thing as having many “quanta” of effort. 

[^340]: Add protein to your diet, eat whole, single-ingredient foods, avoid processed foods, limit your intake of added sugar, drink water, drink (unsweetened) coffee, supplement with glucomannan, avoid liquid calories, fast intermittently, drink (unsweetened) green tea, eat more fruits and vegetables, count calories once in a while, use smaller plates, try a low-carb diet, eat more slowly, add eggs to your diet, spice up your meals, take probiotics, get enough sleep, eat more fiber, brush your teeth after meals, combat your food addiction, do some sort of cardio, add resistance exercises, use whey protein, practice mindful eating, focus on changing your lifestyle.

In molecules, the exchange of energy is induced by the natural tendency for energy to balance itself between 2 different states of energy, such as hot and cold.  Here, the 2 differing states are “what is” and “what is intended”, regardless of whether that intention resulted from necessity or desire.  The intention acts to balance that difference, as in, “I am overweight.  I need to lose weight.  I will diet”.  But, as we all know too well, intention without effort is useless (and possibly dangerous).   Energy causes something to change direction or move; here, it is effort that causes *something* to change direction or move.  Whatever is being changed acts as resistance, so we’ll just call it that.   

Notice what we have now.  *Resistance* is acting like *mass* that requires *effort* over *time*, or *force*, to change, and the amount of that *force* is determined by one’s *intention*, or what we would refer to as *force of will*, which is another way to say *intention*.   Metaphorically, the concept of *F=m&times;a* is perfectly captured in this one sentence from a speech given to the graduates of the Lenox Academy in Massachusetts, which coined the phrase “onward and upward”:

> Fail not for sorrow, falter not for sin, but onward, upward, till the goal ye win. **~Frances Anne Kemble, 1809-93**

This phrase makes it quite clear that *intention* to reach one’s goal must be a consistent *force* greater than the *resistance* of sorrow and sin.

Can we then say, if *F=m&times;a*, then *effort&times;time = resistance&times;intention*?  

Let’s test this.  We’ll use the values of ***f***=force, ***e***=effort, ***t***=time, ***r***=resistance, and ***i***=intention.

Imagine these scenarios where different people must quit smoking:

- A life-long smoker has a strong habit (r=10) with a mild intention (i=2) to smoke. *f=i&times;r* &therefore; 2&times;10=20
- A beginning smoker has a mild habit (r=2)  with a strong intention (i=10) to smoke. *f=i&times;r* &therefore; 10&times;2=20

In either case, the *force* of smoking is 20.  To bring the force to 0 either, *intention* (to smoke) and/or *resistance* (to not smoking, habit) must be reduced .

The strength of the *resistance* is a result of how long, or much *time*, the *effort* to smoke was applied when measured by *intention* because $r=\frac{e\times t}{i}$ or $r=\frac{f}{i}$.  For example: 

- A lot of effort applied to smoking (e=10, i.e., 30 cigarettes per day) over a long time (t=100) with weak intentions (i=2) to quit, resulting in a resistance of 500. $(r=\frac{10\times 100}{2}\therefore\ r=\frac{1000}{2}=500)$

- Mild effort applied to smoking (e=2, i.e., 6 cigarettes per day) over a long time (t=100) with weak intentions (i=2) to quit, resulting in a resistance of 100.  $(r=\frac{2\times 100}{2}\therefore\ r=\frac{200}{2}=100)$

- A lot of effort applied to smoking (e=10) over a short time (t=10) with weak intentions (i=2) to quit,  resulting in a resistance of 50. $(r=\frac{10\times 10}{2}\therefore\ r=\frac{100}{2}=50)$

- Mild effort applied to smoking (e=2) over a short time (t=10) with weak intentions (i=2) to quit, resulting in a resistance of 10. $(r=\frac{2\times 10}{2}\therefore\ r=\frac{20}{2}=10)$

You can see that the long-time heavy smoker has the greatest resistance to overcome while the beginning mild smoker’s resistance to quitting is small, but the long-term mild smoker has twice the resistance as the short-term heavy smoker.

The strength of the *intention* is a result of how long, or much *time*, the *effort* to smoke was applied when measured by *resistance*because $i=\frac{e\times t}{r}$ or $i=\frac{f}{r}$.  For example: 

- A heavy smoker (e=10) who’s been smoking for a long time (t=100) but doesn’t think it’s that big a problem (r=2) has an intention to smoke of 500  $(i=\frac{10\times 100}{2}\therefore\ i=\frac{1000}{2}=500)$.
- A heavy smoker (e=10) who’s been smoking for a long time (t=100) but thinks it’s a problem (r=10) has an intention to smoke of 100.  $(i=\frac{10\times 100}{10}\therefore\ i=\frac{1000}{10}=100)$.
- A heavy smoker (e=10) who’s been smoking for a long time (t=100) but thinks it’s a huge problem (r=100) has an intention to smoke of 10. $(i=\frac{10\times 100}{100}\therefore\ i=\frac{1000}{100}=1)$.

Was this test “successful”? It correctly predicts who would have the hardest time quitting, the effects of effort over time, and even tells us that smoking a little for a long time creates a bigger problem than smoking a lot over a little time, which we know to be true[^455].  While we can’t apply the statistical data of physics to these concepts of effort, force, resistance, and intention, there certainly seems to be a correlation between the laws of physics and these broader interpretations of the physical attributes.  This is what we would expect to see if we were looking at how fundamental patterns of energy apply to different contexts.

If this correlation has any merit, then we can also say that intention equates to voltage, effort equates to amperage or current, and resistance is resistance.  This correlation is poetically poignant when you consider how high-voltage/low-current circuits are more dangerous than low-voltage/high-current circuits.  You won’t feel anything if you touch the terminals of 12 volt 5-amp battery, but touch a 220-volt supply with 0.27 amps, and you will be shocked, literally and figuratively, even though they both have the same amount of power, implying that that big intentions with little effort are more dangerous than small intentions with a lot of effort.  Is this true? Is attempting to start a new business, get married, or climb Mount Everest with little effort more dangerous than 100% commitment to balancing your checkbook (not that anyone has a checkbook these days), waxing the floor, or buying a new pair of slippers? For anyone who has experience with these examples, the answer is obvious.

## Simple Cycles

Let’s look at the simple cycle again as the archetypal pattern that describes the movement of energy through a medium, regardless of the medium.  In some contexts, this pattern is quite measurable; in others, it is analogous, such as in the migration pattern of the Arctic Tern.

When we examine the predator-prey cycles, we see they follow the same cyclical archetype of light, electricity, or sound.  Below we show a typical predator pray cycle (taken from a Northern Arizona University online biology class).  On the left is the data over time, and on the right is the “Phase plan”, or the graph of the relationship between the 2 variables (coyotes and rabbits).  This is a naturally occurring cycle, but you’ll notice that the two cycles naturally occur <IMG src='../Images/math/329.svg' style='vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;‘'/> a wavelength apart, which is the maximum difference any two waves can have.  We also see this in electricity, where voltage lags current by <IMG src='../Images/math/329.svg' style='vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;'/> wave, or how electric and magnetic fields in a wave are 90&deg; apart.  Quite literally, the predator is acting like the *voltage*, and the prey is acting like *current*.  In the world of electricity, *resistance*=$\frac{voltage}{current}$, R=$\frac{V}{I}$, and *power=voltage &times; amperage* (*P=V&times;I*).  Does this mean we can find the equivalent to *resistance* in the predator/prey cycle with $\frac{predator}{prey}$? 

If we look at the numbers, they don’t appear to make a lot of sense as $\frac{1000\ coyotes}{10\ rabbits}$=100, or $\frac{10\ coyotes}{1000\ rabbits}$=0.01, which says that the more resistance, the more the coyotes die of starvation, and the less resistance, the more the rabbits die by getting eaten.  However, let’s look at it energetically.  If the rabbits are being eaten, there is a transfer of energy from rabbit to coyote, and the coyote continues to contribute to the chain “downstream”, so to speak.  If there are no rabbits, the coyotes die of starvation, and while the energy is still transferred back into the earth (from decomposed coyotes who died of starvation), the chain’s downstream has been weakened.  In this sense, the value of the *resistance* would represent the *resistance* to the chain’s *sustainability*, as the rabbits are to coyotes, what coyotes are to wolves, and what wolves are to mountain lions.  Ultimately, everything ends up back in the ground, feeding the grass the rabbits eat.  In the coyote/rabbit world, a coyote needs about 275 rabbits a year to survive if all they ate was rabbits.  This would then mean that the baseline *r-value* for a coyote/rabbit *system* is $r=\frac{1}{275}$=0.00363.  Of course, coyotes don’t just eat rabbits, so in practice, *r-values* for all the systems interacting with each other would need to be determined and integrated before these values had any practical meaning.

What about the *power* equivalent with *predator&times;prey*? Certainly, the concept of *power*, which is the rate at which energy is transferred, applies to coyotes eating rabbits, and *current*, which is the amount of energy moving through a system, would apply to the rabbits, at least as far as the coyotes are concerned.  With a little imagination and creativity, you can see how this ecological cycle could be described as an oscillating circuit using concepts of Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> law of motion.

In the image below, the left column shows the *Predator-Prey Cycles*, and beneath that, the cycle of the *system* of coyote/rabbit (combined cycles).  The right column shows the *Parent Archetype* of the *Predator-Pray Cycles*, which is 2 perfect sine waves out of phase by 90&deg; the same pattern we see in electromagnetic energy.  There is another archetype not shown, and it is the archetype of the archetype, or the *Meta Archetype*.  As it has no context, no values apply, so it’s just a flat line, a frequency of 0 Hz, just like nature’s DC current.

We keep bumping into the same universal constants and concepts in humanity’s quest to understand reality and its processes, either through religion, culture, economics, nature, alchemy, or science.
