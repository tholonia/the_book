##### **Keywords:** <u>mythology</u>, <u>archetypes</u>, <u>coherence</u>, prayer, meditation, thought, entropy-debt , <u>structure</u>, water, <u>language</u>, names of <u>god</u>, <u>tulpas</u>, <u>golems</u>, <u>archetypes</u>

It may seem odd that *<u>mythology</u>* would be placed in the chapter of how <u>awareness</u> is/can be applied in the real world, but beliefs of any sort are excellent examples of the application of awareness.  Beliefs are perhaps the most common way to channel <u>awareness</u> as they can cohere the otherwise undirected and unrestrained awareness.  In this way, beliefs act like the point of *Definition* in the <u>tholonic</u> trinity, putting restrictions on how that <u>awareness</u> is expressed.  Considering this, it is no wonder that <u>mythologies</u> so closely reflected the <u>archetypes</u> of creation.  From the <u>tholonic</u> view, it was/is the <u>intelligence</u> of these <u>archetypes</u> that vie for that <u>awareness</u> within the arena of human consciousness. <u>Mythologies</u> and beliefs are the earliest form of Man's *conscious will* to have a hand in the creation of his reality.

It may sound childish or even superstitious to suggest that <u>archetypes</u> can have intentions that can result in conflicting and/or cooperative relationships, which implies allies and enemies, and therefore some sort of diplomacy and politics.  In one sense it is childish, in that it leaves so much open to the imagination. In another sense it is childish because beliefs in general are an early form of learning how to use the power of awareness.  Beliefs are the Legos of awareness.  Beliefs are also placeholders that fill in the blanks of our limited <u>understanding</u> of the mechanics of <u>awareness</u>, <u>intention</u>, and <u>intelligence</u>, which is also why they have such a significant effect on our <u>understanding</u> of reality.  

The ancient <u>myths</u> provided a pretty effective way to understand the workings of <u>reality</u>, given the context and <u>scope</u> of our abilities when they were created.  We see these <u>gods</u> and their unending dramas as anthropomorphized <u>concepts</u> of <u>tholonic</u> intelligences and their interactions. As previously stated, <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetypes</u>, like the <u>gods</u> themselves, are autonomous agents in a self-reproducing system.  To get a general idea of the Mexican-soap-opera-of-psychopaths-on-steroids that was the <u>life</u> of the <u>Gods</u>, see *Appendix D*, “*Greek <u>Gods</u>*”  It is short, and quite entertaining.

These two charts compare the <u>hierarchy</u> of the Greek <u>Gods</u> (according to Gaius Julius <u>Hyginus</u>, a scholar born in 64 B.C.) and the same <u>hierarchy</u> composed of one (of many) <u>archetypes</u> represented by that deity.

<center><img src='../Images/godtree.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Its insightful to see how everything starts out in the <u>nothingness</u> of the void, descends through the noble qualities of intellect, skill, healing, imagination, and ultimately settles down to youth, <u>sex</u>, booze, food, and war.  Clearly, the Ancient Greeks were on to something.

## Sensing <u>Intention</u>

The idea that plants, and presumably other <u>life</u> forms, are sensitive to the feelings and intentions of others within their sphere of influence is not a new idea.  One of the early (1960s) instances of this idea is called the *<u>Backster</u> Effect*[^300]named after Grover Cleveland <u>Backster</u> Jr. who was not only an interrogation specialist for the Central <u>Intelligence</u> Agency (CIA) but went on to become Chairman of the *Research and Instrument Committee of the Academy for Scientific Interrogation*.  From his “interrogations” of plants, he concluded that plants not only feel pain, but emotions, and even have <u>ESP</u> abilities.

There still exists debate as to the validity of his claims, as well as the claims made in the popular 1973 book “*The Secret <u>Life</u> of Plants*”, but at the very least, there is sufficient evidence to justify more investigation.  The <u>tholonic</u> view is that everything that exists is part of a *Vast Active Living <u>Intelligence</u> System* (to borrow the title of a book by author Phillip <u>K. Dick</u>) that we are calling the Thologram, and consequently, everything *must* be connected to everything else in some way and form.  As our <u>knowledge</u> and our ability to share that <u>knowledge</u> expands, our <u>understanding</u> of <u>reality</u> so too will expand, and in many different directions.  Multiple theories, philosophies, practices, will not only emerge, but each will have their own body of evidence supporting that model. Some will flourish and others will wither away. This is the <u>evolution</u> of perspective.  

[^300]: Backster, Cleve & Karron, Db. (1968). **Evidence of a Primary Perception In Plant Life**. 10. 

Similar to the "Can you prove Australia exists?" problem, at some point we need to choose what or who to *believe* as true or not. While the <u>Backster</u> Effect is soundly grounded in <u>tholonic</u> principles, that alone is not enough to accept it as real.  Perhaps the most convincing support comes from one of the more ingenious scientists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Marcel Vogel.    

Marcel <u>Vogel</u>  (1917 - 1991) was a research scientist for IBM’s San Jose facility for 27 years and was granted a <u>number</u> of patents, from hard-disk <u>magnetic</u> coatings to egg testing.  At age six he was pronounced dead from double lobar pneumonia. He claimed that while he was “dead” he experienced a light and a sense of <u>love</u> and well being that was overwhelming, and this formed the underlying fabric of his <u>life</u> and beliefs. 

With the aid of IBM's state-of-the-art equipment, he replicated the <u>Backster</u> Effect.  Below is the polygraph results that he said made him a “believer”.

<img src='../Images/Cleve_Backster_2.png' style='width:100%'/>

<u>Vogel</u> even lectured at IBM on the subject of "Do Plant Have Emotions?", which, in 1969, was a radical concept.  He experimented with plants for some time and discovered a <u>number</u> of very odd and “unscientific” facts.  For example; 

- It was observed that when he released his breath slowly there was virtually no response from the plant, but when he pulsed his breath through the nostrils, as he held a thought in mind, the plant would respond dramatically. 
- The plant's response was the same regardless of distance, as the results were the same when he was in San Jose (where his lab and the plant were), or in Prague, Czechoslovakia.  This also suggests that <u>coherent</u> thought acts similarly to <u>coherent</u> <u>energy</u> in that it can travel over long distances without loosing power.  
- Plants appeared to respond more to the threat of damage than to the actual damage itself.
- Plants appeared to have many of the same properties as batteries, especially when it came to their interactions with thoughts.
- It was observed that the attitude, or mind-set, of the experimenter had a measurable effect upon the test-results.  This might shed some light on the inconsistent result of the “water <u>memory</u>” experiments of Jacques <u>Benveniste</u>, as related previously.
- He concluded from these experiments that he “learned that there is <u>energy</u> connected with thought. Thought can be pulsed and the <u>energy</u> connected with it becomes <u>coherent</u> and has a laser-like power.”

Because of his young near-death-experience, Marcel believed that the greatest cohering agent is love.  This may be correct.  The <u>tholonic</u> view is that *<u>intention</u>* is the basis of <u>reality</u> and creation, but says nothing about what that <u>intention</u> *is*.  The <u>tholonic</u> position is that *any* <u>intention</u> is equally valid.  However, it's reasonable to imagine that some intentions are more effective than others, and it is reasonable that the <u>intention</u> of <u>love</u> may be the most sustainable.

Such <u>ideas</u> did not endear him to the scientific community, but this discovery opened many new doors of investigation for Marcel, especially in the areas of <u>crystals</u> and water, with some very impressive (anecdotal) results.  Needless to say, this not only set him apart from his fellow scientists, but ensured his obscurity.

## Maharishi Effect

Given the general direction of mainstream <u>science</u>, we do not see a lot of investigation into how thought affects external <u>reality</u>, but some research does  *(see items 3 and 4 in "Other Experiments" list below)*.  We will look at one research report here, *“Effects of Group Practice of the <u>Transcendental</u> Meditation Program on Preventing Violent Crime in Washington, D. C.: Results of the National Demonstration Project, June-July 1993”*[^160] published in the journal *“Social Indicators Research.”*

C., Alexander, Charles N., Shatkin, Susan F., Davies, John L., Hughes, Anne O., Ross, Emanuel, Orme-Johnson, David W., **Effects of Group Practice of the Transcendental Meditation Program on Preventing Violent Crime in Washington, D.C.: Results of the National Demonstration Project, June--July 1993,** Social Indicators Research,,8 June 01,1999 <https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1006978911496> Full report available at <http://www.istpp.org/crime_prevention>

This study and its 4,000 participant, which was monitored by a 27-member project review board comprised of independent scientists and Leading citizens, found that there was a significant statistical result.

What was this study exactly?

> This study presents the final results of a two-month prospective experiment to reduce violent crime in Washington, DC.  On the basis of previous research, it was hypothesized that the level of violent crime in the District of Columbia would drop significantly with the creation of a large group of participants in the <u>Transcendental</u> Meditation® and TM-Siddhi® programs to increase <u>coherence</u> and reduce stress in the District.[^161]

Here, the word “<u>coherence</u>” refers to its definition of “*the quality of forming a unified whole*.”

<img src='../Images/medchart.png' style='FLOAT:RIGHT;width:40%'/>The results were impressive.

This is only one study, so it is not definitive, but it is certainly supportive of the idea that directed <u>intention</u>, what the participants called *<u>coherence</u>*, and what we are calling *<u>order</u>* (as that is what unifies the parts into the whole), has an extended effect.  The explanation, according to the <u>tholonic</u> model, is that the directed <u>energy</u> of <u>coherent</u> thought alter the curves of various <u>archetypes</u> thereby altering the probability of where the “<u>work</u>” will produce the most <u>order</u>, or where and how <u>energy</u> will be expressed across a <u>scope</u>’s spectrum.

### On a Personal Note

I had a particularly insightful experience with the Maharishi Effect back in the late ’60s when I was a young teenager.  My father was a captain of industry in the world of electrical components, ultimately becoming president of one of the pioneering companies that helped create the first integrated circuit.

Born of poor Scottish immigrants in the Bronx on the tail of the Great Depression, and serving in Korea, he was no stranger to hard times and hard <u>work</u>, which made him one of the most pragmatic and practical people I have ever known.  He was a devout capitalist, atheist, and husband, and had no patience for anything that did not produce results.  Hippies were idiots, imports were ruining the economy, Scotch whiskey was better, and talking about your problems was for whiners.  You get the picture.

At the insistence of his wife (and my mother), he joined her for a seminar on *Creative <u>Intelligence</u> (CI)*, which was what they called <u>Transcendental</u> Meditation back then for those folks like my father.  He heard their claims about improved mental and physical <u>health</u>, better focus, fewer distractions, etc.  He decided to test their claims by giving all his employees in one of his factories CI training, along with an extra half-hour at lunch break for them to take this training and practice their new CI skills.

This factory was in a poor, rundown industrial town in New England, and the people that worked in those factories were uneducated, unskilled, assembly-line laborers - not exactly an open-minded demographic.  I knew a <u>number</u> of them myself, as we lived in that town, and many never made it past 4<sup>th</sup> grade.  The rivers in this town were dead from all the pollution, and the neighboring town had the highest *per capita* <u>suicide</u> rate in the United States.  It was a dreary, dark place filled with dreary, dark people.

His peers in the industry thought he was being foolish to deploy such a plan, but the results were astounding.  People were fighting less, taking less sick leave, injuries were down, production went up; in general, everything improved.  So much so, that the Wall Street Journal did an article on him and his “revolutionary” new technique.  He became known as some kind of New Age Industrialist, which was ironically funny as he was as new age as his ’57 Chevy.

Ultimately, this new <u>concept</u> was unsustainable in that environment because eventually people began to abuse the extra time meant for CI, and everything went back to *normal* with sick leaves, fighting, injuries, and lower production, so the program was scrapped.

## Prayer

You might be thinking that traditional prayer holds the same power, but the evidence migth suggest otherwise.  Why? Because most prayer is anything but coherent.  Prayer means very different things depending on <u>culture</u>, <u>religion</u>, personal perspectives, etc.  Perhaps this is a side-effect of monotheism, which eliminated the myriad of niche gods.  In any case, prayer can be anything from begging to demanding, justifying to virtue signaling, and occasionally it can be an expression of gratitude and <u>love</u>, but using group prayer to effect change is like using a group of blind people to paint a room by throwing handfuls of paint at the wall.  Your room *will* get painted, but you’ll wish it didn’t.

This was recently confirmed by a &dollar;2.3-million-dollar study on the effect of prayer on the sick, involving over 1,800 patients.  It was the largest study of its kind ever undertaken.  Contrary to prayer helping the sick, they found that when a patient knew others were praying for them, they tended to have *more* complications.[^162]

There are other studies that conclude the exact opposite, such as Dr. <u>Byrd</u>’s study “*Positive Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer in a Coronary Care Unit Population*”[^163] and Dr. <u>Harris</u>’s  study “*A <u>Randomized</u>, Controlled Trial of the Effects of Remote, Intercessory Prayer on Outcomes in Patients Admitted to the Coronary Care Unit*”[^164].  However, without a detailed comparison of the studies, and specifically the manner in which the participants prayed, we cannot know to what degree <u>coherence</u> was at play.

The difference between the <u>coherence</u> of <u>Transcendental</u> Meditation and prayer is the former follows a very specific set of rules, has a beginning, a middle and an end, has a clearly defined non-personal target subject, and never attempts to <u>force</u> change.  Prayer can follow these same rules, but it rarely does because there are no rules to prayer and varies greatly depending on <u>culture</u>, tradition, perspective, <u>intention</u>, etc.

The practice of *<u>coherent</u> prayer* is common among metaphysical secret societies.  For example, in the not-so-secret secret <u>society</u> of the *<u>Order</u> of the Rosy Cross*, or *Rosicrucians*,  members who have reached a certain level of initiation are introduced to a schedule of “prayers”. This is a globally synchronized schedule of times when people are requested to focus their <u>energy</u> on a particular topic, such as <u>health</u> or <u>family</u> or finances, and in a specific manner.  If one is not in need, they send their gratitude into a “pool” of <u>energy</u> specific to that topic.  If one has a need in these areas they can join in at the scheduled times and “tap into” that pool.  This is a very <u>coherent</u> technique because it has specific <u>archetypes</u> and directed <u>energy</u>, which then creates <u>sustainable</u> <u>patterns</u>, and it (reportedly) works surprisingly well.

The effect of the *<u>Consciousness</u> <u>Field</u>*, as it is referred to by Roger *Nelson* of Princeton University and director of *The Global <u>Consciousness</u> Project*, is not limited to <u>humans</u>, but can affect matter and machines *(see first two items listed below under “Other Experiments”).*

## Thought

If we are looking at meditation, prayer, and other forms of <u>coherent</u> thought, we have to also look at the <u>concept</u> of <u>entropy</u> because <u>coherence</u> is *lower* in <u>entropy</u> than incoherence, just as a laser light is lower in <u>entropy</u> that normal diffuse light.  This suggests that the act of meditation, prayer, concentration, focus, and even attention in general, creates a lower <u>entropy</u> state from a higher <u>entropy</u> state, which is contrary to the direction of <u>entropy</u>, at least according to the 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>Law</u> of Thermodynamics.  While the 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>Law</u> is not really a <u>law</u> but a statistical probability, the probability of breaking that <u>law</u> is extremely unlikely, so how can <u>coherence</u> of thought be possible?

**Another point regarding <u>entropy</u>**

- It needs to be pointed out that *<u>entropy</u>* is a property, a measure of the *total <u>energy</u>* in a system; the more *total <u>energy</u>*, the lower the *<u>entropy</u>*.  This *total <u>energy</u>* is technically called *enthalpy*.  However, we use the term *<u>entropy</u>* to represent the measure of *total <u>energy</u>* and the <u>energy</u> itself, or *enthalpy*.  This is the same as how we refer to physical material as *<u>mass</u>* rather than *matter*, as *matter* is the actual material, but *<u>mass</u>* is the measure of that *matter*.  A kilogram is *<u>mass</u>*, a kilogram of potatoes is *matter*. They are the same thing, but referenced differently, that is, until we get into the bizarre outliers of quantum and relativistic phenomena where *massless matter* exists, but as we don’t normally exist in wormholes, we will conveniently ignore this exception.  *Massless matter* is not to be confused with *massless particles*, such as photons.  The <u>concept</u> of a *massless particle* was born when <u>Einstein</u> proclaimed “light consists of spatially <u>random</u> particles”, which was a poor choice of words, but that was in 1905, so he didn’t have a lot of options given the scientific vocabulary of the day.  We all know that <u>mass</u> means matter, and the point of this book is to try and  communicate <u>ideas</u> to the readers, not to confuse them.  Additionally, because we are using the <u>concept</u> of *<u>entropy</u>* outside of its strictly <u>thermodynamic</u> context, the <u>concept</u> of *enthalpy* becomes even more confusing.  A compressed JPG or ZIP file image has high *<u>entropy</u>*, so, does that means it has less *enthalpy*?  What does that even mean in the context of JPG images and ZIP files?  An uncompressed file has more *total <u>energy</u>* than an zipped file? Perhaps, but we won’t be going near such concepts.  *Applying* enthalpy to <u>consciousness</u> would get even more obtuse and confusing, especially as we have no idea of what the “<u>energy</u> of <u>consciousness</u>” is and certainly no idea how to measure it.

From a <u>thermodynamic</u> perspective, focus, concentration, prayer, etc., only uses 5% of the <u>calories</u> needed to power the <u>brain</u>, or 0.65 <u>calories</u> an hour, at most, and no matter how hard you concentrate, which means a single chocolate chip cookie could power a year’s worth of meditation or focused attention if someone meditated 20 minutes a day, and yet focused thinking is what accounts for pretty much everything mankind has created since he thought “hmm… I wonder if farming is easier than hunting and gathering?” and started the *Neolithic Revolution* that changed humanity forever.  It was not the 0.65 cal/hr our hunter/gatherer ancestors spent coming up with that idea that challenged the 2<sup>nd</sup> Law; it was the consequences of the idea.  If one happened to reach enlightenment during a meditation we certainly would not say they achieved 2.7214 <u>watts</u> (which is 0.65 <u>calories</u>) of enlightenment. 

This brings us back to the question “How can a system become more organized in an ever increasingly chaotic system?”.  This argument is called the *<u>Schrödinger</u> paradox*, as it was introduced to the world by Erwin <u>Schrödinger</u> in 1933 in his book “What is <u>Life</u>?”.  But, <u>Schrödinger</u> had the answer (it’s not clear why it is called a paradox considering the question is rhetorical, making it more of a *<u>Schrödinger</u>’s rhetoric*).  We briefly touched on this earlier, but here is a paraphrased version of <u>Schrödinger</u>’s explanation:

The 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>Law</u> only applies to *closed* systems, where no <u>energy</u> can enter or leave.  <u>Life</u>, at least on <u>Earth</u>, is an *open* system, as we get lots of <u>energy</u> from the Sun, and our solar system is an open system as it gets <u>energy</u> from the galaxy.  In practical terms , the <u>Universe</u> as a whole is the only closed system (that we know of) in nature.  So, the <u>evolution</u> and <u>self-organizing</u> of <u>life</u> *appears* to break the 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>Law</u>, but doesn’t *really* because it’s getting more <u>energy</u> from the Sun than it expends evolving and self-organizing.  This is called *free-energy* or *negentropy* (negative <u>entropy</u>), a term coined by <u>Schrödinger</u> in the same book.  The <u>reason</u> he coined the word rather than just saying “negative <u>entropy</u>” is because he did not feel that simply adding a “-” in front of “<u>entropy</u>” captured the remarkable ability of living systems to seemingly violate the 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>law</u> by lowering their <u>entropy</u> and increasing organization, <u>order</u>, and structure.[^418]

[^418]: Ho, Mae-Wan, “**What is (Schrödinger's) Negentropy?**”, Modern Trends in BioThermoKinetics 3, 50-61, 199, https://www.i-sis.org.uk/negentr.php

This tells us that a system can <u>self-organize</u> as long as the reduction local <u>entropy</u> is less than the free-energy it receives.  And why *would* any system <u>self-organize</u> in the first place?  Because whatever anything is organizing into, it does so only because it is a more efficient <u>structure</u> for the distribution and preservation of <u>energy</u>, as we saw back in *Chapter 4* where Jeremy England of M.I.T. explained how hydrocarbon-based blobs can turn into a <u>life</u> form.

<u>Schrödinger</u> was speaking about things like <u>evolution</u> and solar/cosmic <u>energy</u>, but <u>thermodynamically</u> speaking, we have more than enough extra <u>energy</u> just from the <u>calories</u> we consume to “power” <u>coherent</u> thought.  So, if we have the <u>energy</u>, and <u>coherent</u> thought is so easy to produce, why don’t we not all have super-coherent <u>consciousness</u>?

One <u>reason</u> has to do with our <u>neurology</u>, which is not only still evolving, but whose  primary task is *not* to develop or enhance <u>consciousness</u> but to “*encode and integrate <u>information</u> acquired from the environment through sensory inputs, and then generate adaptive behavioral responses*”[^414].  <u>Consciousness</u> is more of a consequential side-effect as a result of our ability to recognize relationships between things, thanks to the relatively new parts of our <u>brains</u> called the *frontoparietal networks*[^415].  Within this network is the crowning achievement of <u>evolution</u>[^416], the *cerebral neocortex*, which, due to its increasing <u>complexity</u>, formed interneuronal networks within networks until one day it was able to process the relationship between “I” and “Not I”, and voilà , “<u>I Am</u>” became a very big thing.  While out new and improved <u>brain</u> give us the ability to apply conscious <u>intention</u> to direct our <u>brain</u> to focus at will, we need to focus our attention in <u>order</u> to make the <u>brain</u> focus our attention.  

Another (highly speculative) <u>reason</u> is that <u>consciousness</u> as an instance of A&I, and even though A&I is <u>energy</u>, it is a different kind of <u>energy</u> that operates in a different <u>scope</u> and context.  <u>Science</u> has no <u>tools</u> to detect it or measure it, and therefore, it doesn’t exist, because accepting the accepted scientific axiom that that&hellip;

> Regardless whether something exists or not, <u>something is real when it</u> is a necessary ingredient of a theory that correctly describes what we observe.

we are also accepting the premise that&hellip;
> Regardless whether something exists or not, something is not real if it doesn’t conform to our theories.

In the <u>tholonic</u> view, this other form of <u>energy</u> would conform to the <u>laws</u> of <u>energy</u> as they apply to this different context, so we would expect there to be some form of <u>entropy</u>, in which case we could apply <u>Schrödinger</u>’s reasoning and suggest that <u>consciousness</u> is an open system receiving free-energy from the Source A&I, and given that <u>consciousness</u> is a contextual instance of A&I, we can also understand it as the result of the need to dissipate the free-energy of the A&I we are exposed to, just as the carbon-based blobs were exposed to energy.  

This is not that radical of an idea, as it is the same <u>concept</u> of how matter is a very slowed-down or rudimentary instance of energy.  Here it is being suggested that <u>energy</u>, as we know it, is itself a rudimentary instance of an even finer form of <u>energy</u> that instantiates as <u>consciousness</u> which is non-physical in <u>nature</u>, but is (JWFIX.. starts with “m’?)”) limited and reformed by the context of our neurology.

**Entropy-debt**

There is another related idea that is also a highly speculative <u>concept</u> which relates to the above, and that is the idea of *entropy-debt*.  This is similar to <u>Schrödinger</u>’s <u>concept</u> of *negentropy*, but *entropy-debt* is more of a <u>tholonic</u> view that also addresses the issues of  <u>consciousness</u> and time.

Farming is a particularly good example to describe this idea because it is a good example of creating a lower <u>entropy</u> process of food procurement, which is exemplified in comparing the <u>order</u> and <u>structure</u> of the hunter-gatherer <u>work</u> environment to the modern farmer’s <u>work</u> environment.

<center><img src='../Images/farming.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Simply by planting the food or raising the livestock one would otherwise have to forage or hunt not only required significantly less <u>calories</u>[^413], but the less productive <u>calories</u> of the less-fit members of the community could now <u>contribute</u> more value to the community-at-large, and the output was potentially far greater with lower risk (“potentially” because early farming was less productive than hunting/gathering, but was still less <u>work</u>, less risk, and socially stabilizing).  By all measures, the <u>entropy</u> of food procurement was dramatically reduced as production became more ordered and structured.  However, if we consider that the introduction of farming also introduced many changes, such as the <u>concept</u> of property rights, population growth, military prowess, and more, all of which led to more complex forms of <u>government</u>, accounting, trade, and war, it could easily be argued that the loss of <u>entropy</u> that farming delivered was more than compensated for.  Of course, these consequences took many years to develop, during which time there was a *entropy-debt*, but a debt that  was <u>balanced</u> by the increased <u>entropy</u> of the consequence of this entropy-reducing invention.

The idea behind *entropy-debt* is that while we accept that <u>entropy</u> will always increase, under certain conditions it can decrease as long as the consequences of that decrease are guaranteed to create more <u>entropy</u> than what was reduced.  It is similar to a bank loan, where you get <u>money</u> you don’t have, but end up repaying it over time.  The difference is with entropy-debt, it is the <u>laws</u> of creation that guarantee the balance.  The “certain conditions” restrictions is that *entropy-debt* cannot exist between interactions of instances, i.e., between <u>energy</u> and matter, which is why we will never see this in the material world, but it can exist between <u>archetypes</u> and instances, or between A&I and the material world.   The <u>reason</u> it can exist in the world of <u>archetypes</u> is because it is there that the pure <u>laws</u>, free of any contextual limits, exist.  If a <u>law</u> states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, then whatever the action is, there *will* be an equal and opposite reaction.  In the case of matter, it will instantiate as force=mass &times; acceleration, and in the world of instances there is no entropy-debt as the exchange must be instant as all the participants are instances exist in the same <u>scope</u> and context of space-time.  The world of <u>archetypes</u> and <u>ideas</u> does not share the same <u>space-time</u> context as space and time are merely <u>concepts</u> or dimensions in the world of archetypes.  In the world of <u>archetypes</u>, the effect is as guaranteed as the <u>existence</u> of a cause, as both exist simultaneously.   2+2 is simultaneously equal to 4, regardless how long it takes someone to discover that fact.  

In the example of farming, a decrease in <u>entropy</u> will simultaneously create and/or accelerate a <u>number</u> of <u>archetypes</u> that will use that extra <u>entropy</u>, even though it may take years for those <u>archetypes</u> to instantiate, but that is a function of time that only matters in the material world.

What this implies is that every idea that increases <u>order</u> and reduces <u>entropy</u> will eventually create more <u>chaos</u> and disorder.  <u>Schrödinger</u> (again) made a parallel observation when he specifically commented on how the <u>order</u> we <u>humans</u> create  seems to make more <u>chaos</u> (as in the farming example above):

> we witness the event that existing <u>order</u> displays the power of maintaining itself and of producing orderly events. That sounds plausible enough, though in finding it plausible we, no doubt, draw on experience concerning social organization and other events which involve the activity of organisms. And so it might seem that something like a vicious circle is implied. - [a dragon biting its tail, the Oroboros]

This makes perfect send if we consider that the more <u>energy</u> is distributed, the more opportunity (microstates) there is for (high-entropy) <u>chaos</u> to form, and as <u>order</u> is a transitional condition or state of <u>chaos</u>, (low-entropy) <u>chaos</u> will always manifest before <u>order</u> forms, and <u>order</u> will always create more (high-entropy) chaos.

In a way, we see this delayed reaction of entropy-debt in our <u>reality</u> now, as the “instant” reaction to a cause it not actually “instant”, but it is at the <u>speed of light</u>, which *is* the speed of cause and effect.  <u>Energy</u> leaves the Sun as its <u>entropy</u> increases.  8.3 minutes later, that <u>energy</u> lowers the <u>entropy</u> of the Earth.  It’s like an *entropy-credit* (i.e, *free-energy*,  *negentropy*,  *negative <u>entropy</u>*), but <u>Earth</u> doesn’t get the credit for 8.3 minutes, but the credit is as guaranteed to arrive as the Sun is guaranteed to shine… even more so, in fact, as the Sun could blink out after the <u>energy</u> was released and we’d still receive it (even if we are extinguished moments later).  

Of course, in our time-limited <u>reality</u>, this delayed reaction always moves from cause to effect, or so we assume, but there is evidence to suggest otherwise.  While there has been some debunking (the validity of which I can’t attest to) of John <u>Wheeler</u>'s *Delayed Choice Experiment* when it comes to changing the *states* of <u>quanta</u> in the past, there is no doubt that the experiment proves you can change the *actions* of the <u>quanta</u> in the past.

Here is a transcript of an interview with John <u>Wheeler</u> speaking about his experiment:

> One of the most remarkable features of <u>nature</u> is that a Quantum can pursue two different routes through two different slits, come together, and manifest itself as a single quantum.  But nothing prevents one from saying that the quantum might be a photon, to speak of quantum of <u>radiation</u>, or it might be an <u>electron</u>, to speak of a particle.  A quantum can go both routes, or it can go a single route.  And it's possible to choose which after the particle has already made its travel.  You choose after the particle has decided whether it's going both routes or one route, and after it's got through, you yourself decide which it shall have done.  You seem to intervene to change the past.  But quantum theory says it can be done.  And I had the pleasure to spell out some of the features of such an experimental arrangement.  My University of Maryland colleague, Carroll Alley, made changes in the experiment, but without changing the principle, and carried it out.  And it checked, so that we now know it is indeed true that one can decide, at the quantum level, whether an object shall go two routes to get to its final point or just one route.  You can make the decision after it's already made the trip.  That sounds like a contradiction, but it works.[^417]**~John <u>Wheeler</u>**

John <u>Wheeler</u> is one of those “trusted sources” who has been to “Australia”, so if he says it’s there, then it’s there.  And if it *is* there, then that means delayed reaction works in both directions, and that means, just like there is an *entropy-credit*, there can be an *entropy-debt*, even if all we have been able to see is just a tiny bit for a moment in time.

[^413]:S. Bowles, **“Cultivation of cereals by the first farmers was not more productive than foraging”**. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108, 4760–4765 (2011).

Incoherence is <u>nature</u>’s first choice when it comes to the distribution and <u>balancing</u> of <u>energy</u>, but we can find examples of <u>coherent</u> transmissions of <u>energy</u> as well, mainly between <u>molecules</u> involved with <u>photosynthesis</u>, microtubules, quantum <u>energy</u> transfer, and possibly mitochondria, <u>bacteria</u>, and plant chloroplasts (part of plant <u>cell</u> that converts light into chemical <u>energy</u>).  This natural <u>coherence</u> is more common  to the micro-world, and is also of very short duration, but it exists because it is a far more efficient way to transfer a specific amount and type of <u>energy</u> to a specific target.  Just as the <u>energy</u> emissions of the blob required a more organized, more <u>structured</u>, more <u>coherent</u> <u>pattern</u> to efficiently move <u>energy</u>, molecular and quantum processes also require a more <u>coherent</u> and efficient form of <u>energy</u> transfer for the same reason.  

If we accept this new theory of <u>life</u>, then we also have to accept that the <u>evolution</u> of <u>life</u>, which includes <u>DNA</u> <u>information</u> storage and retrieval systems, is also a by-product of, and for, the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>, and that sounds like a pretty big leap.  However, examples of this claim are self-assembling <u>crystals</u> and quasi-crystals (structures that act like <u>crystals</u> but do not look like <u>crystals</u>) and are the subject of much research.  <u>DNA</u> self-assembles in the same manner, and many self-assembling quasi-crystals *are* DNA.  

Now consider that the primary function of anything that exists is to remain in <u>existence</u>, to maintain a stable <u>pattern</u> of <u>energy</u> distribution within the context of its existence.  Our hydrocarbon-based blobs could only evolve into <u>life</u> after they created a synergetic relationship with its surrounding; i.e., it will need to consume or assimilate resources and <u>contribute</u> something of equal or more value back to its context or environment, and the <u>information</u> is passed on via DNA.

<u>Schrödinger</u> also observed that: 

> An organism's astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of <u>order</u>' on itself and thus escaping the decay into <u>atomic</u> <u>chaos</u> - of 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environment - seems to be connected with the presence of the 'aperiodic solids', the <u>chromosome</u> <u>molecules</u>, which doubtless represent the highest degree of well-ordered <u>atomic</u> association we know of&hellip;

In other words, the ability for living organisms to increase <u>coherence</u>, reduce dispersion, (i.e., reduce <u>entropy</u>) seems to be connected with the quasi-crystals of <u>DNA</u> (i.e. <u>information</u>).

It is the <u>DNA</u> of <u>life</u> forms that determines how it will manage not only the <u>sustainability</u> of an organism, but also the transmission of <u>energy</u>, especially *free-energy*, and as all the organs, including the <u>brain</u>, come into <u>existence</u> and grow in accordance with the rules recorded in the DNA.  We can then say that the entire organism and its parts exist because of the <u>DNA</u> that is designed to optimize existing <u>energy</u> and dissipate excess energy.

If we are constantly being “energized” or “irradiated” by the omnipresence of A&I, how are we dissipating all the excess “<u>energy</u>” we are exposed to?  Through increasingly complex systems of dissipation, such as <u>consciousness</u>, meta-consciousness, and the systems they “self-assemble”. “Self-assemble” is in quotes because from a Universal perspective, everything that did, does, or will exist is self-assembled.

As <u>pattern</u> and <u>order</u> become more complex, interconnected, and efficient, <u>coherent</u> exchange of <u>energy</u> will become more common, not unlike the ever-evolving *frontoparietal networks* from which <u>consciousness</u> emerged.  Rain is a very efficient and  <u>incoherent</u> way to distribute water, and in the past, <u>humans</u> would hope for rain to water the plants that they foraged.  <u>Coherent</u> attempts were made to invoke the rain, such as praying, dancing, and sacrificing.  Regardless as to to the viability of such techniques, they have been around for at least 10,000 years, even among <u>cultures</u> that had developed writing and record-keeping[^419].   Eventually, <u>humans</u> created far more <u>coherent</u> and efficient techniques that resulted in far more <u>coherent</u> efficient production, such as irrigation, water management, dry farming techniques, and technology.

We are <u>partons</u> to a larger tholon. It is our ability to transfer <u>coherent</u> <u>energy</u>, with technology and with thought, that makes us part of the <u>energy</u> distribution system of that larger system, but more than that, we are that part of this larger system because of the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> in that larger system has evolved to the point where it needs to produce <u>coherent</u> distribution of <u>energy</u>, and as <u>energy</u> is <u>Awareness</u> and Intentions, that translates to “the intentional directing of <u>consciousness</u>”.

## <u>Structured</u> Water

Given how water seems to be such a good <u>tholonic</u> medium, can we lower the <u>entropy</u> of water by increasing its <u>order</u>,  adding <u>structure</u> in a way that matches and/or enhances the <u>patterns</u> of the thologram and see some differences in how it <u>transmits</u> or interacts with <u>energy</u>? If we do see any differences, then we have another piece of <u>potential</u> evidence that supports the <u>tholonic</u> model.

As it happens, there is such a thing as *<u>structured</u> water*.  *<u>Coherent</u>* or *<u>Structured</u>* water, for those who are not familiar with the term, is regular water that has been modified to give it more <u>structure</u> or <u>pattern</u>, specifically in the way that the water <u>molecules</u> are arranged in relation to one another, or so it is claimed.

OK, I know I probably lost some of the readers with this last sentence.  If you do an Internet search of “<u>structured</u> water” one of the first results you will get is the Wikipedia entry that begins with “<u>structured</u> water is a term used in a marketing scam” and although that is true to the extent that anything can be a scam in the hands of scammers, the entry says nothing whatsoever on the research and testing that has been done regarding the use of <u>structured</u> water.

To the dogmatically skeptical, anything that challenges the current world view is “swarming with worms of heretical perversity”. It doesn’t matter if a new idea, in this case, <u>structured</u> water, has vast amounts of scientific research and support from highly accredited professionals and ample evidence one can find by researching the pioneers and leaders in the <u>field</u>, many with a lifetime of <u>contributions</u> and dozens of Chairs, Fellows, and Adjuncts with Accolades of their <u>life</u>’s <u>work</u>[^78], as well as hundreds of papers and dozens of books related to and supporting the <u>structured</u> water phenomena.  Skepticism has its place and serves a critical purpose, but regarding the extreme skepticism of <u>structured</u> water, that purpose does not seem to be moving <u>understanding</u> forward or seeking new solutions to real-world problems, such as solving global water shortage problems and increasing crop production, as has been well documented by some of Australia’s largest produce farms.

To see the result of my own tests and how to make <u>structured</u> water, see *Appendix J: <u>Structured</u> Water*.

[^78]: See resources at <http://hexagonalwater.com> for more information.

There is quite a lot of good research on the subject that we won’t detail here, but if you want to learn more a good place to start is Fabian Ptok’s Masters theses *“Alternative Irrigation Methods: <u>Structured</u> Water in the context of a Growing Global Food Crisis due to Water Shortages”*[^79], which covers the subject well from an agricultural and security perspective but also has a <u>number</u> of references to the researchers and <u>work</u> going on in this area.  One of the often cited studies showed dramatic results in decreasing blood and <u>DNA</u> damage in diabetic rats, but this study is also criticized as it was small[^303] . There is also a book by Professor Gerald Pollack, who has an impressive list of credentials[^304], and is available online for free[^80] (which I have not read, so this is not an endorsement or recommendation).  Another good source is the <u>work</u> of Marcel <u>Vogel</u> (more on him later) who claimed that through years of <u>work</u> and thousands of experiments he was able to prove that various forms of <u>energy</u>, including thought, could permanently change the spectrographic properties of water, [^301] and that water was an <u>information</u> storage system.  This last claim is especially significant considering <u>Vogel</u> was not only a chemical and <u>physics</u> researcher at IBM for 27 years, but he was an <u>information</u> medium specialist, holding patents of hard-drive <u>memory</u> technologies that are in use to this day.

<img src="../Images/116-water-ice.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>Water is a particularly good test medium because the structure of molecular water is tetrahedral, and being the most basic shape of creation lends itself to many different tholonic applications.  It’s worth noting that when it was originally suggested that water might be tetrahedral in shape back in 1938 the idea was met with disbelief.  It was not until 80 years later, in 2013, that this was finally accepted as valid.  Today “it is widely accepted that liquid water structure is comprised of two closely interweaved components; i.e.  tetrahedral and hexagonal structures”.[^81]In fact, water, as ice, may be the closest instance of the entire tholonic structure of any other substance (that is common to us).  *(image above from “Tetrahedrality is key to the uniqueness of water”[^82])*

The *silicate <u>structures</u>* of minerals are also quiet similar in that they are made up of tetrahedrons of various arrangements.  In fact, the <u>structure</u> of water and quartz is so close that in some conditions ice has the same (or really similar) <u>structure</u> as quartz[^302]!      In fact, the word “<u>crystal</u>” comes form the Greek word *krustallos*, meaning both “ice” and “rock <u>crystal</u>, because they believed quartz was permanently frozen water.  This lends some credence to the metaphysical and ancient idea that water and quartz have a special relationship.

Radical <u>ideas</u> are often met with radical resistance.  <u>Structured</u> water is one of those <u>ideas</u>, and it falls into the same New Age category as “<u>crystal</u> power”.   Ignoring the 249D <u>crystal</u> that (possibly) created <u>reality</u>, common <u>crystals</u> do have some pretty impressive qualities.  

- Generate <u>electricity</u> (piezoelectric).

- Amplify, <u>transmit</u>, and store <u>data</u> (up to 300 million years [^342]).

- Generate signals (used in microchips, watches, internet routers and network controllers, satellites, up to billions of <u>cycles</u> per second).

- Control the transmission and phase of of light (liquid <u>crystal</u> displays - LCDs, )

- Ability to alter time (yes! they are called *time <u>crystals</u>*, and they represent a new state of matter, according to MIT.[^343]

- Ability to hold a <u>magnetic</u> charge.

The <u>reason</u> <u>crystals</u> can do all these amazing things is because of the <u>structure</u> of the elements that make a <u>crystal</u>, and water, with its tetrahedral <u>structure</u>, is like a form of liquid crystal.  As we have stated, <u>energy</u> creates <u>order</u>, and <u>movement</u> is the effect of <u>energy</u>, therefore, adding <u>energy</u> via <u>movement</u> to a tetrahedral liquid, such as water, will  have some positive or reinforcing effect on its <u>structure</u>, and that <u>structure</u>, being a more efficient conduit for transferring <u>energy</u>, will likewise have an effect on that which interacts with it by transferring more energy.

The hypothesis is then, simply by causing <u>movement</u> to commercial water (tap or bottled) we should see measurable effects.

In Ptok’s Master’s thesis mentioned above, the author examines various tests that grew different plants using tap water and <u>structured</u> water.

<center><img src='../Images/095-ptolks-images.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One of his findings was that using <u>structured</u> water increased alfalfa growth by 15.1%.  This may not sound like much, but in the U.S. alone a 15% increase in alfalfa growth represents an additional 20,700,000 tons of alfalfa, which has a value of over 4 billion dollars.

Similarly, some of Australia’s largest produce farms have reported needing 25% less water to produce a superior product than with traditional water.  This is a perfect example of how the simple enhancement of <u>order</u> at the most fundamental level can have radical changes up the chain.  These dramatic results were achieved with only one change to one element in one application.

In the <u>tholonic</u> model, this example also applies to <u>ideas</u>, <u>concepts</u>, and intelligence;  small changes in one area can have radical consequences in the world of <u>ideas</u>, and of course, ideologies.

**Review of studies**

There have been a <u>number</u> of studies of SW using animals.  One review does a meta-analysis of these studies, “<u>Structured</u> Water: effects on animals”. [^322]

[^322]: Lindinger, Michael. (2021). **Structured Water: effects on animals**. Journal of Animal Science. 99. 10.1093/jas/skab063.  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349669391_Structured_Water_effects_on_animals

> This review focuses on the effects of <u>structured</u> water on animals when it is consumed on a daily basis. <u>Structured</u> water is liquid water that is given altered H-bonding <u>structure</u> by treatment with various forms of <u>energy</u> including <u>magnetic</u> <u>fields</u> and light. While most of the research has been conducted on <u>magnetized</u>‘ water, which has <u>structure</u> of short duration, recent research has examined effects of a <u>structured</u> water with stability of at least 3.5 months.

**Conclusion**:

>  The animal research conducted to date consistently demonstrated beneficial effects of SW consumption.

<img src='../Images/bullied_plant.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>There is another conclusion that also needs to be looked at, and that is not just the inability for some people to accept such findings, but their need to attack the findings.  An example of this is the very simple “experiment” produced by IKEA where they placed 2 identical plants side by side for 30 days in many K-12 GEMS (Global Education Management Systems[^420]) schools across the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E).  Signs near each plant instructed viewer to either “compliment” the plant (right) or “bully” the plant (left).  The short YouTube video[^421] had 1.2 million views, with 6,700 likes and 625 dislikes, and many of the comments were as vile as YouTube will allow.  Granted, this exhibition will never get publisher in the *Journal for Experimental Science*, but it is certainly sufficient to raise the question “Do emotions effect life?”, which sounds like a ridiculously silly question, as we all know the answer to that, but while there are countless studies on the effect of plants on human emotions, there is nary a one (that I can find) on the effects of human emotions on plants.  This is unfortunate, as such a study would tell us a lot about the emotions/biology connection that presumably would have some effect among the often emotionally chaotic, fear-driven, culturally distorted minds of humans.  Unfortunately, the anger and dismissive attitudes expressed in the comments of this video are shared by to many leaders in the scientific community, which can, at times, be more of a cult of scientism.

## <u>Qualitative</u> <u>Energy</u>

One experiment to consider is the <u>concept</u> of *<u>qualitative</u> <u>energy</u>*.  We have countless ways to test the <u>quantitative</u> properties of <u>energy</u>, but if we are claiming that <u>quantitative</u> and <u>qualitative</u> properties are related in some way, then can one property effect the other, for example, via <u>induction</u>?  

Measuring the value of <u>money</u> is <u>quantitative</u>, so a \$10 bill is always \$10 regardless if it came from a blood diamond or a farmer, but many people would reject that \$10 if they knew it was from blood diamonds &hellip;a <u>qualitative</u> value that had significant <u>quantitative</u> effects as it has shifted over $1,000,000,000 away from the blood diamond industry.  Does that make the value of the <u>money</u> <u>qualitative</u>?  Subjectively, perhaps, but not objectively because all legal tender is centrally controlled by the State in a manner that removes all <u>qualitative</u> value.  In addition, the State has made it illegal to create a new forms of money.  But this is not the case in the <u>cryptocurrency</u> world.  There are currencies whose value is hugely influenced by the service they provide, such as <u>cryptocurrencies</u> specifically bound to agriculture (SOYA, CORA, WHEA), precious metals (XAUT, DGX, GLC, PMGT, LKNS), marijuana (POT, CANN, DOPE), and even pornography (PORNCOIN).  There are coins based on political and ideological goals, such as privacy (XRP), candidates (FJB, LGB), <u>religions</u> (BBP, CT).  There are more that 19,000 <u>cryptocurrencies</u> at the time of this writing, each with their own underlying philosophy, vision, goals, and values. These new infant currencies demonstrate the bond between <u>quantitative</u> and <u>qualitative</u> values, and how each of these two qualities can induce changes in the other.

By the same token (pun intended), and because <u>money</u> is a abstract representation of <u>energy</u>, we can extend this idea to <u>energy</u> in general and ask “can <u>qualitative</u> attributes effect <u>quantitative</u> measure, or visa versa?”, “Is there such a thing as <u>qualitative</u> <u>induction</u>?”

For example, a simple test could be performed with two vases of identical water. One vase can be subjected to constructive emotions, sounds, etc, while the others are subjected to destructive emotions, sounds etc.  This water is then used to water two identical plants.  Any difference in the plant’s growth might be attributable to the “quality” of the water.  

Why not simply expose the plants to such emotions?  Because the use of the <u>tholonically</u> compatible substance of water as a storage medium is the real test.  How, or if, the water effects plants is really the testing of the idea.  The question of whether plants are sensitive to any non-physical or non-electromagnetic stimulus remains, but we can look to the existing theories and tests to find that answer.  One such experiment is “The Florence Experiment” where bean plants accompanied a human as they slid down a 20 meter slide installed in the *Palazzo Strozzi* Renaissance palace of art in Florence, Italy.   This exhibit was put together by plant neurobiologist Professor Stefano <u>Mancuso</u>, founder of the study of plant neurobiology that studies the <u>intelligence</u> of plants, and German artist and former entomology researcher with a Ph.D. in Phytopathology, Carsten Höllerm.  

The idea was to see how plants responded to the emotions of “fun” and “exciting”.  This experiment was followed with another experiment where plants were exposed to people watching horror films.  Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I have yet to hear back from the producers of this experiment who I reached out to in June of 2022.

It would not be surprising if the results confirmed that plants respond to emotions.  In fact, it would be surprising if they did not, as plants, being the very bridge between the source of <u>energy</u> for this <u>planet</u> (Sun) and <u>life</u> on this <u>planet</u>, must be of a very high <u>order</u> of <u>intelligence</u>, at least according to the <u>tholonic</u> definition of <u>intelligence</u> of “The ability to maintain a <u>sustainable</u> <u>pattern</u> of <u>energy</u> within the <u>scope</u> of its existence.” and the <u>tholonic</u> claim that “<u>Intelligence</u> exists in anything that has a <u>sustainable</u> <u>pattern</u> of energy.”, because plants are not only far more <u>sustainable</u> than all other forms of <u>life</u>, no other form of <u>life</u> is <u>sustainable</u> without them. 

But even the traditional definition of <u>intelligence</u> of “The ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or *trying* situations.” applies because the creation of <u>life</u> on a dead <u>planet</u> is about as *trying* as it gets.  We can take it further with the traditional definition of <u>intelligence</u> of “The ability to learn, understand, and make judgments or have opinions that are based on reason.” if we presume the <u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u> that instantiated in plant <u>life</u> has the ability to learn, understand, make judgments, <u>reason</u> and even have opinions.  Now, apply the <u>tholonic</u> definition of “<u>understanding</u>”, i.e., “the <u>knowledge</u> of something sufficient enough to be able to make verifiably accurate <u>statements regarding said</u> thing”, and we can also claim that a <u>tholon</u> has <u>knowledge</u>, as every form of <u>life</u> is accurately described by the <u>knowledge</u> data-storage medium of RNA/DNA (which may have existed long before <u>life</u> itself).

Note that the <u>tholonic</u> definition of intelligence&hellip;

> The ability to maintain a <u>sustainable</u> <u>pattern</u> of <u>energy</u> within the <u>scope</u> of its existence.


&hellip; implicitly includes the traditional definitions, and where “<u>reason</u>” extends beyond current human reasoning.  As <u>patterns</u> come from <u>order</u>, which is the result of <u>energy</u>, and <u>energy</u> is <u>awareness</u>, then, by this reasoning, <u>intelligence</u> is synonymous with “ordered or <u>structured</u> awareness.”

<u>Mancuso</u> claim that plants *are* intelligent is quite compatible with the <u>tholonic</u> model, as is even Charles Darwin’s, albeit contextually limited by the world-view of the 1870s .

> “it’s hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle (the first part of a <u>seedling</u> to emerge from the <u>seed</u> during the process of germination) thus endowed, and having the power of directing movements of the adjoining parts, acts like a <u>brain</u> of one of the lower animals.”  **~Charles Darwin, “The Power of <u>Movement</u> in Plants” (1880)**

What is surprising is that our current world-view continues to be based on the erroneous <u>concepts</u> passed down by the likes of <u>Aristotle</u>, who wrote in “De Anima”, that plants have a “low level”, “vegetative <u>soul</u>” because they are incapable of local <u>movement</u> and ability to sense.  Like his claims about <u>gravity</u>, both statements are observably wrong, even to the ancient Greeks, had he bothered to actually investigate.

## <u>Language</u> and <u>Metaphysics</u>

It is well known that <u>language</u> has the power to hold a social <u>order</u> together, or to destroy it.  <u>Language</u> has such power because the <u>order</u> and <u>hierarchy</u> of <u>concepts</u> that form a social <u>order</u> are known, taught and defined by words.  In addition, words and <u>language</u> actually form neurological pathways in our <u>brain</u>, and these pathways exert physiological pressure in the physical <u>structure</u> of the <u>language</u> processing part of the brain.  The brilliant linguist Noam <u>Chomsky</u>, in his *Generative-transformational Theory* of <u>language</u>, states that children are born with the hard-wired <u>understanding</u> of <u>language</u>, and the only thing they need to learn is the context of how that innate <u>understanding</u> is <u>culturally</u> expressed.  

Anecdotal to <u>Chomsky</u>’s point, my son was never taught to read or write, raised in a house without TV, radio, or internet, and in a rural environment.  He was exposed to a Rudolf Steiner-esq form of learning where he was not “taught”, but rather “exposed”, allowing his innate <u>knowledge</u> to manifest at its natural pace.  When he entered public school at the age of 8 or 9,  his reading and writing abilities far exceeded those of his classmates. 

It must be stated that while the first casualty of war may be <u>truth</u>, the first act of war is an attack on <u>language</u> and words, which begins long before the shooting starts.  One example of such a salvo aimed at Western <u>Culture</u> is the post-modern <u>concept</u> of <u>language</u> and the redefining of words.  This very successful neo-Marxist offensive began in the 1960s and has been so successful that by 2022 even a U.S, Supreme Court Justice was unable to define the word “woman”, and this view was staunchly supported by the largest publishing company in the U.S., who unironically reported “[her] answer was scientifically sound. There is no sufficient way to clearly define what makes someone a woman.”[^358]

Gannett Satellite Information Network, March 28, 2022. https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2022/03/24/marsha-blackburn-asked-ketanji-jackson-define-woman-science/7152439001/. 

Words and <u>language</u> are fundamental to psychology, communications, behavior, <u>culture</u>, cognition, relationships, perception, identity, <u>politics</u>, and just about all aspects of a society.  Consequently, it’s challenging to describe <u>ideas</u> that use <u>concepts</u> that are outside our vernacular.  The only solution is to define new <u>concepts</u> and create new words for them. Last year, 20 new words were added to the dictionary including “ecoanxiety” , “Dunning-Kruger”, “hodophobia” (fear of traveling), “nothingburger”, “ratio” (as in “dude, you got ratio-ed”; likes/dislikes of a social media post).  The words we create, and how we use words in general, might be a good indicator as to where <u>society</u> is headed.  At least that is the <u>concept</u> behind the study of “predictive linguistics”.  The problem with predictive linguistics, and words/language in general, is that each person’s different experience with words invokes a different <u>qualitative</u> context[^357], so, even if everyone agrees on what the word “walk” means, it does not mean that word will invoke the same subjective context, and the context will determine the psychological, emotional, typically unconscious or “right <u>brain</u>” meaning of that word.  All of us have experienced this, usually with scents, places, or things, but it applies to words/language as well.

[^357]: VERHAGEN, VÉRONIQUE & Mos, Maria & Backus, Ad & SCHILPEROORD, JOOST. (2018). “**Predictive language processing revealing usage-based variation.**” Language and Cognition. 10. 329-373. 10.1017/langcog.2018.4. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325566313_Predictive_language_processing_revealing_usage-based_variation/citation/download

Scientific or technical words are the easiest to create because they can be clearly and definitively described.  Words to convey emotions or beliefs are harder as they are subjective, but as we all have feelings and beliefs, we can all generally agree on words like “<u>love</u>”, “<u>fear</u>”, “<u>spirit</u>”, “freedom”, but the specifics of these words will never be agreed upon.  It’s even harder to define new words for existential or esoteric <u>concepts</u>, such as “<u>awareness</u>”, “<u>consciousness</u>”, “<u>soul</u>”, “<u>god</u>”, or the metaphysical aspects of <u>concepts</u> like “<u>intention</u>”, “free-will”, “being”.  The most challenging <u>concepts</u> to describe are those that are technical, emotional, and metaphysical, such as the <u>concept</u> of energy. <u>Energy</u> is everything that is, can be, and will ever be, and by everything, I mean *everything*, which includes <u>consciousness</u> and <u>awareness</u>, intentions, cause and effect, <u>space-time</u>, <u>spirit</u>, <u>soul</u>, free-will, and literally anything else you, or anyone who ever did, is, or will live, can imagine.

In <u>order</u> to describe such things we can invent new words, but unless you are a <u>cultural</u> icon, world leader, or brilliant scientist who has the support of the media, your new words will remain a mystery.   Many new words are serendipitous, as they were accidentally created , such as the word “malapropism” (nonsensical, often humorous utterance), which is an <u>adaptation</u> of the name of a character, Mrs. Malaprop, from the 1775 play “The Rivals”.  Even the word “serendipity” itself was invented by writer and politician Horace <u>Walpole</u> in 1754 as an allusion to *Serendip*, an old name for Sri Lanka.  “banana republic”, “catch-22”, “bedazzled”, “beatnik”, “cyberspace”, are all invented words that found a home in the <u>collective</u> <u>consciousness</u> of our <u>culture</u> because we could all recognize and agree on their meaning and agree that it filled a need.  To create a new word that describes a state of <u>understanding</u>, we can look to Robert <u>Heinlein</u>, who had to write an entire book (“Stranger in a Strange Land”, 1961) to describe the nuanced definition of the word “grok”, and even then, the definition has been drastically reduced to a simple sentence; “To understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with; also, to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment".

Short of inventing new words, we can use existing words as representative, symbolic, metaphorical allusions to describe metaphysical, supernatural, or existential concepts.  Some languages are better suited for this, so we can appropriate their words into our vernacular, such as “chi”, “chakras”,“<u>Tao</u>”, gestalt”, “karma”, “mantra”, “yoga”, “prana”.

How, then, can we talk about such broad and illusive <u>concepts</u> as A&I in a way that can be understood by all? The best we can do is use the simplest words possible, leaving less room for wildly differing interpretations.   At the most fundamental level, A&I can be described as “<u>I Am</u>” and “I Will”.  It doesn’t get more basic that that, but as we’ll see, these <u>concepts</u> are anything but simple.

In the thologram, we have the <u>concept</u> of a 0-dimensional point which only has 2 attributes, A&I.  Linguistically, the <u>singularity</u> of that point can only be described as that which “is”, and the <u>nothingness</u> in which it resides, is that which “is not”. This is the first <u>duality</u> of *<u>somethingness</u>* and *<u>nothingness</u>* which describes a state of <u>existence</u> or “being”.  Applied to subjective or 1<sup>st</sup> person context of “to be”, these would be “Not I” and “<u>I am</u>”, or, to borrow the opening words of the most widely known and quoted lines in modern English literature:

> “To be, or not to be” **~“Hamlet”, William Shakespeare, 1600**

We now have these 3 objective <u>concepts</u>, “is not”, “is”, and “to be”.  These <u>concepts</u> are instances of (or lack of) <u>Awareness</u>, as the only prerequisite for some “thing” to exist is the <u>awareness</u> of its <u>existence</u>, even if that “thing” is a 0 dimensional dot.  Here, a “thing” can be no more that a <u>concept</u>, and that <u>concept</u> can even be the <u>concept</u> of <u>awareness</u>!  For something to exist, it does not need any other qualifier other than “to be”.  It doesn’t need to “do” anything, nor does it need a purpose, <u>reason</u>, or rationale to exist.  In the context of <u>Intention</u>, “is not”, “is”, and “<u>I am</u>” become “will not”, “will be”, and “I will”, and the only qualifier that “will be” requires is an <u>intention</u> to “to be”.

This should sound familiar as we briefly touched on the same theme in Chapter 7, *<u>Structure</u>*.  This association between the thologram and ancient spiritual <u>concepts</u> was never intended, but it was inevitable as both paths are based on the same <u>laws</u> of existence.

<img src='../Images/iamtri.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>Awareness is the primal state of existence and instantiates as consciousness, which in the human context is “I”. Intention is the primal force which created the primal movement, the 1<sup>st</sup> cause that started the chain reaction of causes and effects instantiates as movement/energy and “I will”.  

Regardless that these <u>concepts</u> have been, and continue to be, hotly debated as to their true meaning, they are the most fundamental and simple of <u>concepts</u> that we have yet to conceive of.  They also match our original <u>tholonic</u> trinity of the N-state/Negotiation/balance (“I/is”), Definition/limitation (“I am/to be”), and Contribution/form (“I Will/will be”).

<u>Language</u> not only dictates <u>cultural</u> values and beliefs, it is inextricably linked to the formation of human <u>consciousness</u>[^422]<sup>,</sup>[^424]<sup>,</sup>[^427] .  This suggests that the <u>limitation</u> of languages will be reflected in <u>limitations</u> of <u>consciousness</u> (and visa versa).  For example, along with our <u>brain</u>’s high evolved *frontoparietal networks* ability to conceive of the <u>concept</u> of “I” was the <u>conception</u> of “Not I”.  These <u>concepts</u> are very effective in helping the <u>brain</u> do what is has evolved to do, which is “*encode and integrate <u>information</u> acquired from the environment through sensory inputs, and then generate adaptive behavioral responses*”.  The <u>reason</u> such <u>concepts</u> could even be conceived in the first place is because the most fundamental reasoning process in any <u>brain</u> is to distinguish between “that which is” vs “that which is not”.  A bee knows “this is (a flower)” from “this is not (a flower)” and even <u>ants</u> have shown they can recognize themselves in a mirror[^425] (which is not the same as having a <u>concept</u> of “I”, although they clearly have a <u>concept</u> of “us”, or rather, the individual <u>ants</u> act like <u>neurons</u> in a <u>collective</u> <u>brain</u>, or superorganism ^[426]).

Even the simplest form of <u>life</u> that exists, the “JCVI-syn3.0”, a man-made <u>cell</u> with only 473 genes[^423], “knows” how to differentiate between “what is” and “what is not”, and does so much better than the scientists who created this first designer organism in history.  We know this because there are 79 genes in this organism that are required for the <u>cell</u> to continue living, but no one has any idea why they are there or what they do.  The organism “knows” they need to exist, otherwise it would not have created them in the first place.

It is reasonable, then, to presume that the simplest relationship that can be recognized is  between that which “is” and that which “is not”, so the <u>concept</u> of “I/Not I” would be the first relationship that the *frontoparietal networks* could form once it conceived of “I”, and given that this <u>concept</u> has been around for about 5 million years, it has a pretty good track record of “*generating adaptive behavioral responses*”.  The “problem” with the <u>concept</u> of “I/Not I” is that it is based on, or rather an <u>evolution</u> of, the fundamental <u>concept</u> of <u>existence</u>, that of “is/not is”, which is built into all life.  This makes sense as far as rules of logic go, but that does not mean it has anything to do with reality.   <u>Reality</u>, as far as the <u>brain</u> is concerned, is whatever it can logically deduce from experience and the senses (of which only 5 get any attention, thanks to <u>Aristotle</u>).  A more objective view of <u>reality</u> tells us that it is the culmination of all that came before and the current state of an ever changing system that has been around for 4.5 billion years.  While logic may be a part of <u>reality</u>, just as <u>order</u> is a part of <u>chaos</u>, that does not mean that all of <u>reality</u> abides by the rules of whatever limited version of logic the <u>brain</u> has so far deduced.  Consequently, that which “is not” is that which does not exist, therefore when there is no more I, “I” ceases to exist, and “I”, being purely a utilitarian construct of the *frontoparietal network* which is only interested in “*generating adaptive behavioral responses*”, can only conclude that the end of “I” is death, as “Not I” is the end of existence.  While it is true in the sense that the <u>brain</u>’s <u>existence</u> comes to an end, from a <u>tholonic</u> view, it is virtually impossible for the <u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u> of one’s <u>existence</u> to come to an end.

Such <u>concepts</u> are reinforced and passed on via <u>language</u>, which forms our human <u>consciousness</u> and <u>understanding</u> of <u>reality</u>, which is why <u>humans</u> have a tendency to believe that death is the end of our existence.  Metaphorically speaking, the <u>brain</u> (and body in general), is like an organic form of artificial <u>intelligence</u> whose primary objective is <u>self-preservation</u>, so we should expect that everything it creates is designed to support that agenda.

We can’t blame the *frontoparietal network* for doing its very impressive job, especially as it has also managed to create meta-physical <u>concepts</u> of some kind of relationship with a something beyond our physical <u>reality</u> (in spite of <u>Aristotle</u>'s attempts at thwarting).  These <u>concepts</u> appeared shortly after (~2 million years) it formed the <u>concept</u> of “I am/I am not” and tend to be driven by hopes and fears, just as our social <u>structures</u> and political/economic systems have been.  Hopes and fears are probably the 2<sup>nd</sup> strongest driving <u>force</u> in human <u>existence</u> after <u>life</u> and death, which makes sense if we consider that “I will” is an extension of “<u>I am</u>”, but with <u>intention</u>, as in, intending to achieve something or intending to avoid something.

We see these <u>concepts</u> at the very foundation of our ancestor’s attempts to describe their emerging <u>concept</u> of “The Creator”.

If we start with Western Judeo-Christian <u>concepts</u>, immediately we are challenged with the obfuscation of language.  This is best represented in the seminal message <u>God</u> gave to Moses at the Burning Bush.

> (3:13) “But,” said Moses to <u>God</u>, “if I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The <u>God</u> of your ancestors has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what do I tell them?” (3:14) <u>God</u> replied to Moses: “<u>I AM</u> WHO <u>I AM</u>”. Then he added: “This is what you will tell the Israelites: ‘<u>I AM</u> has sent me to you’”. **~Exodus**

The most important detail about this line is that it can only be understood if read in Hebrew (Note: we don’t actually know what <u>language</u> the message was delivered in, not do we know if Moses even knew Hebrew.  All we know it our current sources were written in Hebrew 1000 years after Moses.  The claim that the message was delivered in Hebrew because <u>God</u> only spoke in Hebrew is suspect, but in any case, the languages of the day, Aramaic, Canaanite, Phoenician, are similar to Hebrew.) 

In Hebrew, the root word that means “to exist” or “to be” is HWH (*Ehyeh*, <img src='../Images/heb_HWH.png' style='height:10px'/>). Adding an A (<img src='../Images/heb_A.png' style='height:10px'/>) at the beginning makes it *1<sup>st</sup> person*, as in “I exist”.  Adding a T (<img src='../Images/heb_TAU.png' style='height:10px'/>) makes it *2<sup>nd</sup> person*, as in “you exist”, and adding a Y (<img src='../Images/heb_YOD.png' style='height:10px'/>) makes it *3<sup>rd</sup> person*, as in “he exists”.

Here, God tells Moses his name is “I AM WHO I AM” (*Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh*, <img src='../Images/iamthatiam.png' style='height:10px'/>), which can be interpreted as:

I will exist because I will exist
I exist because I exist
<u>I am</u> who <u>I am</u>
I will be who I will be
<u>I am</u> that which exists

It is not a matter of choosing which interpretation is correct.  Given that Hebrew only has tenses for *finished* (perfect) and *unfinished* (imperfect), and no *future* or *past* tenses, all these (and more) interpretations are simultaneously correct.

But, God also said “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”.  “I AM” here is spelled like YHWH (*Yih’weh*, <img src='../Images/yhvh.png' style='height:10px'/>, YHWH), which is the *3<sup>rd</sup> person* form of “to be” (HWH, *Ehyeh*, <img src='../Images/heb_HWH.png' style='height:10px'/>) .  This translates to “He exists” *and* “He will exist”.  It is unclear if the voice of *Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh* was speaking as the messenger for the even greater God of “He Is”, or, as pointed out by Jaynes, refers to itself in the *3<sup>rd</sup> person* because human consciousness at that time could only conceive of a god as someone/something outside of themselves.

In either case, we have instances of <u>Awareness</u> (I am, I exist) and instances of <u>Intention</u> (I will). This correlation fits so nicely that we could say that *finished* is a description of <u>Awareness</u>, in that <u>awareness</u>, in its pure form, is finished, perfect, in the present.  There is nothing for <u>Awareness</u> to “do” other that “to be”.  <u>Intention</u> is unfinished, a work-in-progress, the future, something that requires “<u>work</u>”.

<center><img src='../Images/ancient-yhvh_2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Why are we getting into this linguistic linguine?  One reason is to demonstrate how difficult it is to describe the simplest concepts that exist, that of “I Am” and “I Will”.  After thousands of years and thousands of volumes of opinion, doctrine, religious law, and in spite of the deliberate hiding, misspelling, encrypting, and misinterpreting the name of God (as it was forbidden to be spoken, and often forbidden to be written), there is still heated debate as to the “real” and/or “secret” significance of these words.  And if this subject wasn’t already shrouded in the mystical symbolism of Moses’ isolated vision, it has been orally passed on for centuries before it was translated from Phoenician to Hebrew to Greek to English and dozens of other languages, none of which hold the same significance as the language of Moses. For example, historians say that the Phoenician alphabet evolved out of symbols for things like fish (<img src='../Images/p_fish.png' style='height:10px'/>), eye (<img src='../Images/p_eye.png' style='height:10px'/>), tooth (<img src='../Images/p_tooth.png' style='height:10px'/>), weapon (<img src='../Images/p_weapon.png' style='height:10px'/>), etc., and even though the symbols and order are similar to Hebrew (and Greek), the legend is that Hebrew came from the words that were written with black fire on white fire in the presence of god, and that these words are the Torah as well as all the names of God, and so powerful with this language that, as the legend goes, the 1<sup>st</sup> letter of the Hebrew alphabet, ALEPH, was created by God opening his mouth to speak, but even that was so overwhelming it caused the people to fall to the ground (is this why the word “Aleph” is the joining of 2 words, “al”, meaning “god”, and “p”, meaning “mouth”? <img src='../Images/alephgodmouth.png' style='height:15px'/>). Obviously, the cultural significance of letters, words, and sentences will be dramatically different even between these similar languages.  

<img src='../Images/iamtri_rings.png' style='float:right;width:35%'/>The other reason is to show how tholonic concepts find form in not only scientific understanding, but religious and spiritual beliefs, and even language itself.  Any belief that advances dogma and confusion of any kind is a belief that is detrimental in understanding the nature of reality, but such beliefs have existed for thousands of years and appear to be very sustainable.  What follows is a simple description of the tholonic concept that is linguistically and conceptually compatible with many belief systems and which may shed light on their cryptic symbolism. 

## What? That!

You enter a restaurant and the waiter asks you “**What** would you like?”, and you reply “I’ll take **that**.” pointing to a plate of Rocky Mountain Oysters.  “What” is defining the context and is synonymous with “anything that” (with the implied “is on the menu”).  When “what” is used as a *predeterminer*, such as “What a great idea!”, it is still referring to the larger <u>concept</u> of “great idea” and is stating that the specific idea is worthy of being a member of the “great idea” category.  Any use of “what” will always refer to some context, either explicitly or implicitly; Bob: “I have <u>money</u> for the meter, so we can park here.”, Carol: “I have six toes.”,  Bob: “What!?”.

The word “that” is, grammatically, a *determiner* and a *relative pronoun* because it always refers to something specific that is contextually relative, and implies a plurality of <u>potential</u> “that’s”.  There’s no need for the waiter to ask what you want, or for you to say “I’ll have **that**”, if the only thing that they serve is Rocky Mountain Oysters.  

“<u>I Am</u> **That** <u>I Am</u>” is stating that the <u>existence</u> of “<u>I Am</u>” is, and only is, <u>awareness</u> of “I”, and that the entirely of that <u>awareness</u> is, and only is, the <u>singularity</u> of that awareness.  There is no context for that which is “<u>I Am</u>” other than “<u>I Am</u>”.  It is perfectly self-referential as “<u>I Am</u>” consists of only of that <u>singularity</u> that is “<u>I Am</u>”.  On other hand, “<u>I Am</u> **What** <u>I Am</u>” means that the entirety of “<u>I Am</u>” is the sum of its parts, and even if those parts are instances of “<u>I Am</u>”, it is not a <u>singularity</u> because “what” explicitly refers to a plurality in contrast to the <u>singularity</u> of “that”. 

<img src='../Images/popeye.png' style='float:right;width:35%'/>Tholonically, “I Am **That** I Am” describes an instance or a concept from the perspective of a tholon as a whole, a *holon*.  “I Am **What** I Am” describes an instance or concept as a collection of parts, or *partons*, that make the whole. It is the difference between the creator and the created (e.g., God and *Popeye the Sailorman’s*, who’s fond of saying “I yam what I yam, and that's all what I yam”). And, as the parts are identical to the whole, we can say that the parts most definitely make in the image of the whole.  

There is only a single instance where the the *holons* and *<u>partons</u>*, the context and contents, are identical, and that is the initial instance of the trigram.  This is the only true instance of “<u>I Am</u> **That** <u>I Am</u>”, and everything that follows is “<u>I Am</u> **What** <u>I Am</u>”.  The Aramaic name of <u>God</u> can be interpreted as either, as if we are being told that Jehovah is both the creator and the created, which is antithetical to the Abrahamic <u>concept</u> of a god.

The thologram is not a <u>religious</u> or spiritual model, even though is seems to border on those areas.  However, it does apply to <u>religious</u> and spiritual models.  For example, we see a <u>number</u> of <u>tholonic</u> <u>concepts</u> in the Bible’s creation story, but, <u>tholonically</u> speaking, the biblical <u>god</u> could not be the Source A&I as it is clearly stated in Genesis 1:26  “then <u>God</u> said, 'Let Us make <u>humans</u> in Our image, according to Our likeness'”, which tells us that the <u>tholon</u> from which creation sprang was a plurality of partons.  The <u>tholonic</u> view is that <u>awareness</u> and <u>intention</u> is inherent in all <u>existence</u>, suggesting that the <u>god</u> of the Bible was a <u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u> establishing its <u>sustainability</u>, which is exactly what we would expect to see.

<u>Descartes</u> has a similar <u>understanding</u> of this <u>concept</u> when he coined “Cognito, ergo sum” (*I think, therefore <u>I am</u>*)[^359].  Unfortunately, qualifying “<u>I Am</u>” with “I Think” could easily be perceived as intellectual hubris, or worse, self-defeating and dangerously ignorant.  While <u>Descartes</u> was a brilliant mathematician, scientist, philosopher and even metaphysician, we have to understand his world view in the context of 17<sup>th</sup> century Europe, before Newton, and even before the *Age of Enlightenment*, as many historian consider the *Age of Enlightenment* to have begun when <u>Descartes</u> originally coined this phrase with his publication of “Discourse on Method”.  The Western <u>concepts</u> of mind, <u>consciousness</u>, and thought were only beginning to hatch and they would quickly grow to be recognized as the defining quality that not only separated man from beast and made man a divine creature.  We can’t just blame intellectual arrogance that the intelligentsia of the day saw themselves closer to, and favored by, their all-powerful <u>Christian</u> sky-god, as this pitfall comes packaged with the ability to say “I” in the first place, but it no doubt played a role in their world view of those who ushered in the Age of Enlightenment.  The ability to have the <u>concept</u> of “<u>I Am</u>” was only possible for those that possessed  <u>consciousness</u> and rationality, as least in the way these <u>concepts</u> were defined later by Freud.  According to <u>Freud</u>, <u>consciousness</u> and rationality are not only ego-centric, they are the source of the ego.  

[^359]:The full quote is “Dubito, ergo sum, vel, quod idem est, cogito, ergo sum” (“I doubt, therefore I am, or what is the same, I think, therefore I am"), which was later shortened to “*Dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum* ("I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am"). 

Being the pioneer that <u>Freud</u> was, we should view his theories as “first drafts” of psychological theory, especially in light of the <u>cultural</u> revolution fueled by madness and modernity in 1900 Vienna.  The <u>seeds</u> of this revolution were being sewn 50 years earlier in Leipzig, Germany, when Gustav <u>Fechner</u>’s theories created what would later become *physiological <u>science</u>*, and 1879, when William <u>Wundt</u> founded the first laboratory for psychological research, also in Leipzig, and which was succeeded the empirical psychology of Ferdinand Ueberwasse.  It was this intellectual garden of the rigid, disciplined, demanding, competitive, imperialist German <u>culture</u> that was being strictly enforced the some-what tyrannical “Iron Chancellor”, Otto von Bismarck, that nourished the theories of <u>Freud</u>, <u>Jung</u>, <u>Adler</u>, <u>Titchener</u>, and the other midwives of modern psychology that quickly spread throughout the western world.  It was this view of humanity that is responsible for the modern <u>concept</u> of “self” JWFIX as an immutable state as well as producing sociopaths such as B. F. <u>Skinner</u> and Ivan Pavlov.  

JWFIX below is bad

The <u>tholonic</u> view is that “self”, like all <u>tholons</u>, is always in a state of growth, change, <u>adaptation</u>, and the <u>concept</u> of “self” is more of a perspective than an instance.  What is commonly called “self” is a particular instance of <u>energy</u> in a specific context.  This makes everything that exists a type of “self”, the only real difference being that the <u>concept</u> of “self” can only exist as an extension of “<u>I am</u>”.  The <u>energy</u> that launches rockets and the <u>energy</u> that moves your arms is the same, only in different form and context.  Remove all context and there is only A&I.  Unlike the psycho-spiritual axiom that the true self is immutable, the <u>tholonic</u> view is that as the context changes, so too does the “self”.  This makes the <u>concept</u> of “self-awareness” a distraction, as there is only Awareness.  This is similar to the erroneous <u>concept</u> of “social justice” as the context has no relevance to the measure of justice.  Nevertheless, the <u>concept</u> of “self” has a very firm footing and won’t be going away anytime soon.

While it is unreasonable to suggest that conscious and rational thinking is ego-centric, it is not unreasonable to see how one must have the <u>concept</u> of “I” before they can say “I Think”, and, having such a <u>concept</u>, it would be natural for followers of a demanding, judging, and punishing <u>god</u> to consider themselves “special” and “better”.  While <u>consciousness</u> and rationality are not ego-centric, that does not mean that conscious, rational <u>humans</u> are not egotistical and self-serving any more than the benefits of <u>fire</u> does not mean it won’t do a lot of damage if uncontrolled.

It’s not surprising then, that for a devout 17<sup>th</sup> century <u>Christian</u>, which includes most, if not all, the great minds of Western modern <u>culture</u>, the <u>concept</u> of “I think” and “<u>I Am</u>” were essentially synonymous.  Thinking is what made man superior, and they had a divine right and responsibility to act superior, as that was commanded by their god:

> *Be fruitful and multiply and fill the <u>earth</u> and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth. **~Genesis 1:26**

For these people, that which did not have the <u>concept</u> of “I” was no more useful than however it was judged to be useful by man.  “I think therefore <u>I am</u>” is simply an contextually abridged version of “<u>I am</u>, therefore <u>I am</u>”, but it does raise the question: is  <u>reason</u> the modern day voice of the <u>gods</u>? Were the ancient voices of the <u>gods</u> an early instance of <u>reason</u>?  

While the thologram has no <u>concept</u> of a divine creator (beyond that of a 0-dimensional dot of A&I in an infinite <u>nothingness</u>), it does have a <u>concept</u> of a <u>hierarchy</u> of intelligences that have <u>awareness</u> and intention. From the <u>tholonic</u> view, the epiphanies of Moses and <u>Descartes</u> were due to the intentions of a greater <u>intelligence</u> to instantiate itself, but not simply *a* greater <u>intelligence</u>, but many greater intelligences that are constantly in a stage of <u>negotiation</u> via conflict and cooperation.

## Are <u>Archetypes</u> Alive?

If <u>ideas</u> are <u>archetypes</u> that have <u>energy</u> and <u>fields</u>, then it would be reasonable to think that an idea could be reinforced and strengthened by adding more <u>energy</u> to it.  How would one go about adding <u>energy</u> to an idea? If <u>awareness</u> is <u>energy</u>, then one obvious way would be to simply increase the <u>awareness</u> that an idea is exposed to.  This sort of thing is done all the time.  We can see it in <u>politics</u>, media, <u>culture</u> and traditions, even  National Prayer Day in the U.S. (May 7th) when the President signs a proclamation encouraging all Americans to pray on this day and “turn to <u>God</u>”.  Now, imagine the <u>potential</u> power of 114,000,000 consciousnesses all being exposed to the same <u>symbolism</u> at the same time, such as any of the bizarre Super Bowl half-time shows, or the 635,000,000 views of the Apollo 11 moon landing, or the London/Philadelphia Live Aid event with its 1.9 billions viewers, or the EU’s <u>reality</u> TV singing <u>competition</u> “Idols” that captured 3.2 billion viewers.  That is literally half the population of the <u>planet</u>!

Considering the average American youth spends 900 hours a year in school, and another 1,200 hours a year watching television, that 70% of the American adult waking <u>life</u> is spent in front of digital media, [^170] and that the average 78.6 year old American will spend 9 years of his <u>life</u> watching TV, 2 years of which is just watching commercials, we're talking about a tremendous amount of <u>awareness</u>, billions and billions of hours, up for grabs. How is that currently being used?  Considering the test results of the *Maharishi Effect* and its 4,000 participants, it’s hard to imagine the possibilities within reach as a global community.

Even if producers and broadcasters of media were oblivious to the power of <u>collective</u> <u>awareness</u>, which I suspect all but a few are, that much concentrated, <u>coherent</u>, focused <u>awareness</u> is naturally going energize all sorts of “<u>fields</u>”, similar to how the thermal hot springs brought <u>life</u> to bio-goo. In the <u>tholonic</u> model, intelligences will outright vie for that <u>energy</u>, especially the less <u>sustainable</u> and parasitic forms of <u>intelligence</u> as those tend to be far more <u>energy</u> greedy.

With the Internet and the decentralization of social media, we have seen a mad scramble for attention-mining and a dramatic polarization of ideologies, beliefs and agendas with equally desperate, dangerous, and even deadly attempts to control that attention.

We are seeing tremendous amounts of <u>awareness</u>, both conscious and unconscious being pumped into <u>ideas</u>, beliefs, symbols, <u>memes</u>, etc., many of which have existing <u>archetypes</u>, and therefore, according to the <u>tholonic</u> model, their own <u>awareness</u>, <u>intention</u>, and intelligence.

[^170]: Average time Americans adults (18+) spend with electronic media Q4 2014. Source: Neilsen.

A suspicious person might begin to suspect that the manipulation of <u>awareness</u> as <u>energy</u> is perhaps already well understood by some less-than-noble folks. Others may think this is bordering on tin-foil-hat territory of mystical conspiracy theories.  The reader will come to their own conclusions. Our <u>intention</u> is to question the effects of such <u>awareness</u> harvesting, especially in light of the <u>understanding</u> that <u>ideas</u> have a <u>life</u> of their own. This includes ancient <u>ideas</u>, even if they seem to have been forgotten by modern society.

With that said, it must also be said that magic and mysticism also follows as strict a set of rules and reasoning as <u>science</u>, if more more strict, if you consider that some magic rituals can take many months, are physically challenging to point of being life-threatening, and leave no room for error, at least according to one of the more well-known grimoires[^428].  A major difference between <u>science</u> and mysticism is that <u>science</u> is based on observations and relationships to the external and physical <u>reality</u>, while mysticism depends on one’s observations and relationships with a non-physical reality.  This may sound like nonsense to some, but consider that near-death experiences (NDEs)[^434] are reported by about 17% of those who nearly die of which only 0.1% believed the experience was not real, [^429] and out-of-body experiences are reported by 10% of the population globally [^430].  These are very statistically significant <u>numbers</u> that are not easy to simply brush off.  An even more significant statistic is that out of the 7.87 billion people on the <u>planet</u>, 7.6 billion of of them (96%) believe in some sort of spiritual <u>concept</u> that, by definition, is not based in objective, physical reality.  

While it is true that the <u>laws</u> of <u>reality</u> are not subject to popular opinion, political and <u>economic</u> pressure, and self-interest, it is definitely the case that the practice of <u>science</u> is.  We can see an example of this in how 0.11% of the world’s population (the 8.8 million scientists[^431]) feel they have the intellectual authority to tell the other 7.87 billion people they share the <u>planet</u> with that they are deluded, gullible (official term “Barnum effect”[^432], i.e. “suckers”), or simply *wrong* in how they perceive their relationship with reality.  Unreasonable as it may be, it is not only common, but supported by the scientific community[^433] and research funding.

The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?). The authors of the study and the SA article conflate our neurological preference for either *time-preference* or *risk-preference* decision making (See: Frederick, Shane. 2005. “**Cognitive Reflection and Decision Making.**” *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, 19 (4): 25-42.DOI: 10.1257/089533005775196732, https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533005775196732), with the assumption that *time-preference* decision making is indicates lazy or weak thinking.  Even worse, they conclude with “Is there any way to protect people from falling prey to such magical thinking?”, which they then equate with “misinformation” and “conspiracy theories”.

It should also be pointed out that many breakthroughs in <u>science</u> had a mystical or paranormal ingredient.  We have seen how Newton was a dedicated alchemist and how  Kekulé’s vision of an ancient mystical symbol changed organic chemistry.  <u>Einstein</u>, though not overtly a follower of any <u>religion</u>, was deeply spiritual and a self-proclaimed disciple of <u>Spinoza</u> a (1632-1677), the 17<sup>th</sup> century Jewish philosopher and mystic.  <u>Einstein</u> even admitted that his Theory of Relativity was a result of his believing that here existed a “harmony of the <u>universe</u>”[^438] and &hellip;

> “behind all the discernible <u>laws</u> and connections, there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this <u>force</u> beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion.”  **~ Albert <u>Einstein</u>**

Furthermore, he believed that true <u>science</u> was to be a path of spiritual understanding:
>“<u>Science</u> can be created only by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward <u>truth</u> and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion.”
>
>“Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of <u>science</u> becomes convinced that a <u>spirit</u> is manifest in the <u>laws</u> of the Universe—a <u>spirit</u> vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. In this way the pursuit of <u>science</u> leads to a <u>religious</u> feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the <u>religiosity</u> of someone more naïve.”
>
>“I assert that the cosmic <u>religious</u> experience is the strongest and noblest driving <u>force</u> behind scientific research&hellip; The <u>religious</u> geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of <u>religious</u> feeling, which knows no dogma and no <u>God</u> conceived in man’s image. In my view it is the most important function of art and <u>science</u> to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it.” 
>**~ Albert <u>Einstein</u>**

Carl <u>Jung</u> was not simply mystically inclined, he was a genuine mystic.  As a child, <u>Jung</u>’s <u>life</u> was filled with paranormal events, such as a wooden table spontaneously splitting apart and a kitchen knife in the cupboard loudly shattering into pieces.[^440]

These lived experiences are what led <u>Jung</u> into psychology,  and why his dissertation published in 1902 was titled “On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena”[^441].  His <u>ideas</u> would open an entirely new path to <u>understanding</u> the mind and consciousness.  

As an adult, <u>Jung</u> had visions and heard voices that made him think he migth be schizophrenic.  In two visions, each of which lasting hours and leaving his ill and weak, the message was the same:

> I saw yellow <u>waves</u>, swimming rubble and the death of thousands… two weeks passed then the visions returned, still more violent than before, and an inner voice spoke: “Look at it, it is completely real, and it will come to pass.  You cannot doubt this”. [^440]

I wasn’t until <u>World War I</u> broke out just months later and he saw all his visions come to pass that he realized it was not him that was insane.

Jung was also quite clear that the paranormal exists, and science is both at a loss to explain it, and has little interest as well, as he states in the forward he wrote for Aniela Jaffe’s “Apparitions and precognition” [^442]:

[^442]: Jaffe, Aniela, “**Geistererscheinungen und Vomidut**” (Zurich, 1958). Trans., New Hyde Park, New York, 1963

> One of the most notable things&hellip; is the fact that among the Swiss, who are commonly regarded as stolid, unimaginative, rationalistic and materialistic, there are just as many ghost stories and such like as, say, in England or Ireland. Indeed, as I know from my own experience and that of other investigators, magic as practiced in the Middle Ages and harking back to much remoter times has by no means died out, but still nourishes today as rampantly as it did centuries ago. One doesn't speak of these things, however, they simply happen, and the intellectuals know nothing of them-for intellectuals know neither themselves nor people as they really are. In the world of the latter, without their being conscious of it, the <u>life</u> of the centuries lives on, and things are continually happening that have accompanied human <u>life</u> from time immemorial: premonitions, foreknowledge, second sight, hauntings, ghosts, return of the dead, bewitching, sorcery, magic spells, etc. Naturally enough our scientific age wants to know whether such things are "true," without taking into account what the <u>nature</u> of any such proof would have to be and how it could be furnished. **~ Carl <u>Jung</u>, "Bilder und Symbole aus E.T.A. Hoffmanns Marchen 'Der goldne Topf”** 

In fact, the arenas of <u>science</u> and mysticism not only share a lot of territory, but at times their difference can me purely semantic.

We accept that the Sun is our <u>planet</u>’s source of <u>energy</u>, and we accept that it is extraterrestrial, but we don’t think of the Sun and a “extraterrestrial <u>energy</u> being”, like our ancient ancestors.  However, if we consider that there is a Sun <u>intelligence</u>, given that the Sun exhibits the properties of <u>intelligence</u> (as we defined it earlier, and certainly the Sun is as “intelligent” as some lab-grown hydrogel), we could say the Sun is an “extraterrestrial <u>energy</u> <u>intelligence</u>” and still be perfectly within the boundaries of scientific reasoning.

<u>Science</u> without mystery of the unknown, the metaphysical, the paranormal, without miracles and the unexplainable, cannot be the <u>science</u> that expands human <u>understanding</u> as it is lost in a dark cave of material scientism.

The <u>tholonic</u> view is that we have the ability to tap into these intelligences and archetypal, non-physical realities whenever we like or need, and often do unconsciously. This is the purpose and power of <u>myths</u>, be they ancient or modern, as well as totems, rituals, rites, superstitions, magic, Wicca, paganism, <u>religion</u>, animism, etc., and with the advent of global media, we will see a renaissance of these <u>concepts</u> emerge in the context of our modern culture.

As these <u>archetypes</u> exist in the uninstantiated <u>tholonic</u> state, they are free from the <u>limitations</u> of our <u>space-time</u> reality.  The <u>myths</u> and beliefs of the ancient past continue to live on in ever-evolving meaning and <u>symbolism</u> that promote their <u>existence</u>, almost like a self-mutating <u>virus</u> that has to constantly adapt to the context it exists in. 

Much of our everyday <u>culture</u> is inextricably bound to these archetypes.  <u>Jung</u> described these <u>archetypes</u> as *ordering factors* in the <u>collective</u> unconscious, such as his 12 <u>archetypes</u> of the human psyche organized into 4 cardinal types, which we described earlier, but there are *ordering factors* in every context of existence.

A <u>cultural</u> example might be how the *ordering factor* of *cooperation/conflict* instantiates as a social <u>concept</u> of “*Heinous deeds will be punished*”.  In the context of the Norse theology, this <u>concept</u> instantiated as the <u>goddess</u> named *Hel* whose job it was to not only judge the dead but also help the apocalypse along by Leading an army of the dead in a ship made of the fingernails of corpses.  This is where the modern word “hell” comes form, but was itself a literary translation (in the King James Bible) of the Hebrew word “Géenna”, which meant “valley of Hinnom”, which was where the waste of Jerusalem was dumped.  This same *ordering factor* appears in <u>cultural</u> <u>concepts</u> such as karma, judgment day, guilt, original sin, and many other forms.

The <u>concept</u> of *hell*, or whatever it happens to be called, is deeply ingrained into the worldview and <u>collective</u> conscious (and unconscious) of billions of people who have little <u>knowledge</u> of the roots of their beliefs. These believers, through the <u>energy</u> of their <u>awareness</u>, bring into creation associated and/or parasitic <u>archetypes</u> that are attached to primary <u>archetypes</u> which they are completely unaware of, but which are energized by that <u>awareness</u> nevertheless.  This suggests that the more <u>awareness</u> directed at the specific <u>concept</u> of *hell*, the more energize the attached <u>concept</u> of an apocalypse become, as they are 2 sides of one state, or rather, 2 <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetypes</u> that have a shared <u>existence</u>, at least within is instance of the <u>concept</u> of *hell*.

<u>Language</u>, as a way to convey <u>concepts</u>, is a microcosm of how <u>archetypes</u> merge, evolve, and reproduce.  An example would be how we can draw a very straight line of connection from the invention of <u>hieroglyphics</u> and moon worship to pharmaceutical drugs and those vacuum sealed plastic bags of imported Colombian coffee you buy at the supermarket, connecting along the way with magicians, pyramids, thieves and secret societies. 

The super-short version goes something like this: The Egyptian moon <u>god</u>, Thoth, who invented <u>hieroglyphics</u>, was adopted by the Greeks who called him Hermes, who was among other things, the protector of thieves. He carried the Caduceus, which became the symbol of modern <u>medicine</u>, and was the founder of the super-secret mystical teachings of Hermetism. So protected were these teachings that the word *hermetic* became synonymous with *perfectly sealed*, hence, *hermetically sealed* bags.  

<center><img src='../Images/hermes.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

What we have referred to as an uninstantiated <u>tholon</u> can, at least in this context, be an <u>archetype</u> as a form of *<u>metameme</u>*, which is a form of a *<u>meme</u>* that only exists in the <u>collective</u> unconscious and/or in the world of <u>archetypes</u>, the thologram. If a <u>meme</u> is “*an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a <u>culture</u>*”, then a <u>metameme</u> is an “an idea or belief formed within the <u>tholonic</u> <u>field</u> (i.e. universal mind,  <u>collective</u> unconscious, morphic <u>field</u>, etc.) and spreads from <u>tholonic</u> <u>field</u> to <u>tholonic</u> <u>field</u>”.   

You may have heard phrases like  “*If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, its probably a duck.*”, or “*When you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras.*”, or “*The simplest explanation is most likely the right one*”, otherwise known as *Occam’s Razor*. Applying the wisdom of this advice, what are we to make of the fact that research out of Princeton University supports the theory that <u>ideas</u>, in the form of social media networks, follow the same growth models as <u>viruses</u> (in the form of <u>diseases</u>)? [^171] 

Outside of the conclusion that perhaps Facebook and Twitter are actually viral <u>diseases</u>, it tells us that <u>ideas</u> follow the same <u>patterns</u> as existing natural <u>patterns</u> of growth, suggesting we might learn more about the <u>life</u> of <u>archetypes</u> if we considered them living.  OK, <u>viruses</u> *may* not be “alive”, but I say *may* because some experts in the <u>field</u> are redefining “<u>life</u>” to include viruses. [^172]<sup>,</sup>[^173] Regardless, the growth, survival, and creation of <u>ideas</u> follow the same <u>patterns</u> as everything else that grows, survives, and creates. For this <u>reason</u>, a clever researcher might be able to find correlations between the <u>life</u> <u>cycle</u> of a galaxy and something as seemingly unrelated as, say, the <u>life</u> <u>cycle</u> of a tomato plant. 

One such researcher might be Tokyo Institute of Technology’s Maruyama <u>Shigenori</u>, a Leading geophysicist and founder of the Center for Bio-Earth <u>Planetology</u>, who, by connecting the theories of astronomy with those of the <u>life</u> sciences, has shown how entire <u>planets</u> may well be living super-organisms.

This idea that <u>archetypes</u> are alive, however, has a dark side to it because so many of our beliefs are manipulated and controlled by others whose agenda is less than altruistic, hidden, and who are aware of the mechanics of <u>reality</u> and consciousness. From the most powerful laser in the world named after the Hindu <u>god</u> of <u>destruction</u> to trivial tarot cards based on movie stars, we can find countless examples of how these imposed <u>archetypes</u> infiltrate our <u>understanding</u> of the world.

So, what kind of world are we creating with our <u>awareness</u>, desires, and beliefs, as a <u>planet</u>? To find out, I wrote a mobile phone app that allows people to send out into the “ether” either a blessing or a curse.  The app was (unsurprisingly) called “Bless or Curse”.

The majority of both blesses and curses are about…wait for it…love, <u>money</u>, and <u>health</u> (surprise!). Some were touching, such as the blessing of “May he win lotto,” cast upon the bus driver who “stopped just for me”. Some are bizarrely dark, such as the curse of “Torture Rape Murder die die die die die,” cast upon Noisy Walgreen Employees. The predominant *cursers*, were Iran, Southern Australia, Puerto Rico, Russia/North Korean border, western South Africa, and Honolulu.  Predominant *blessers* were northwest Canada, southwest U.S., Eastern Europe, South pacific, Uruguay, Ghana/Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and the jungles of Northern Brazil.

Humanity seems to be pretty well split down the middle between the *blessers* and the *cursers*, as you can see by this report map below. In general, it tended to hover over the 53% area, giving the *blessers* a slight edge over the *cursers*.

### <u>Tulpas</u>

One of the better legends of how <u>ideas</u> can take on a <u>life</u> of their own comes from the well-known 1932 book, *Magic And Mystery In Tibet*, by Belgian-French explorer Alexandra David-Néel.

In the Far East, there is the <u>concept</u> of a *<u>tulpa</u>*, which is a type of thought-form. They are understood to be a sentient <u>consciousness</u> that resides in the <u>brain</u> of the host and can have separate feelings, thoughts, and <u>memories</u> from the host and can communicate through thought, imagination, feelings, or verbally. With enough practice and concentration, the host can see the <u>tulpa</u>’s form in the real world, and for the truly advanced *<u>tulpamancer</u>*, can be seen by others as well. Of course, this is a preposterous idea to Western thinkers. 

Alexandra David-Neel was a woman of remarkable courage. She recounts how the only way she could enter the forbidden (to foreigners) city of Lhasa, Tibet, was to sneak in dressed as a beggar carrying only a compass, <u>money</u> (for ransom in case she was kidnapped), and a gun. She was also known for her sound scientific thinking and her opinions and observation carried weight in academic and scientific circles. Doctor A. D’Arsonval, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, The Academy of <u>Medicine</u>, professor at the College of France and president of the Institute of General Psychology, said of Alexandra David-Néel:

> This well-known and courageous explorer of Tibet unites in herself all the physical, moral and intellectual qualities that could be desired of one who is to observe and examine a subject of this kind.[^174]

So, when she described how she used the techniques taught to her by the Tibetan magicians to conjure up her own *<u>tulpa</u>*, it is not as easy to discard them as pure fantasy. In her case, she manifested a short, pudgy, jolly monk, as per her intentions.  Perhaps even more interesting was that this <u>tulpa</u>, once it began to be visible to others, began to have its own free will, a <u>life</u> of its own; the jolly, fat monk began to grow lean and taller, and less jolly. It eventually became a major problem for her, and she had to spend 6 months “dissolving” it. As she states:

> The fat, chubby-cheeked fellow grew leaner, his face assumed a vaguely mocking, sly, malignant look. He became more troublesome and bold. In brief, he escaped my control. I ought to have let the phenomenon follow its course, but the presence of that unwanted companion began to prove trying to my nerves; it turned into a ‘day-nightmare.’ Moreover, I was beginning to plan my journey to Lhasa and needed a quiet <u>brain</u> devoid of other preoccupations, so I decided to dissolve the phantom. I succeeded, but only after six months of hard struggle. My mind-creature was tenacious of life. There is nothing strange in the fact that I may have created my own hallucination. The interesting point is that in these cases of materialization, others see the thought-forms that have been created.

In Jewish folklore, there is a similar <u>concept</u> call a *<u>golem</u>* (not the *gollum* from “Lord of the Rings”, which is spelled differently).  These are beings created from clay or mud and then brought to life.  The most famous legend of a <u>golem</u> is the 16<sup>th</sup> century *<u>Golem</u> of Prague*.  This massive <u>golem</u> was specifically created to help protect the oppressed Jews, but, due to simple human error, the <u>golem</u> went berserk, destroyed the neighborhood, and was ultimately disabled and stored in the attic of a synagogue for hundred of years until that synagogue was bombed by the Nazis in WWII.  Some people believe it was not destroyed and is waiting to be brought back to life.

Whether <u>tulpas</u> and <u>golems</u> exist or not is left to the reader. The point is that the belief that <u>ideas</u> can take on a <u>life</u> of their own is neither new nor unique.

Perhaps we shall see our own modern versions of <u>tulpas</u> and <u>golems</u> soon, as that is where the research into what is essentially the <u>collective</u> <u>consciousness</u> of artificial <u>intelligence</u>, or *A.I. Swarms*, as they are called,[^175]<sup>,</sup>[^176] , and early attempts to create artificial <u>humans</u>[^177] appears to be heading.  No doubt, one day they too will prove to be “more troublesome and bold, escaping our control.”
