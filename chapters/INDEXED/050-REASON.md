# 5: <u>REASON</u>

###### The ability to understand something is limited by our ability to perceive something.  As our perception changes, so does our <u>understanding</u> change, and with that, the reasoning we apply.

##### **Synopsis:** <u>Reason</u> is a universal <u>archetype</u> with local instances which produce <u>order</u> within limited scopes and contexts, and is therefore limited to that context. Human reasoning is limited to, and changes with, human contexts and abilities, but it is in accord with the instances of <u>reason</u> and <u>structure</u> of the system it exists within.  All <u>movement</u>, or “<u>work</u>”, within these systems, being self-similar and redundant, is limited by the <u>structure</u>, or reasoning, of these systems.  All <u>movement</u> is an act of <u>energy</u> <u>balancing</u> itself, <u>structure</u>, and the inherent reasoning of a systems  <u>structure</u> exists only to facilitate that balance.

##### **Keywords:** <u>energy</u>, <u>effort</u>, <u>reason</u>, <u>resistance</u>, <u>cycles</u>, <u>intention</u>

We arrived at <u>laws</u> through <u>reason</u>, and we <u>humans</u> are rather proud of that claim as we like to believe we invented <u>reason</u>, but we didn’t.  We did discover it, however, so at least we can take credit for being doggedly curious.

*<u>Reason</u>* is what we call our ability to recognize the natural processes that arise from the <u>patterns</u> of creation and is the product of intellectual survival, a skill we evolved to give us fang-less, claw-less, slow, soft and chewy <u>humans</u> a fighting chance in the Darwinian battlefield&hellip; at least that's one theory.

To be fair, there has been a long-standing debate over whether mathematics, and by association, <u>reason</u>, was invented or discovered.  One of the more solid debates is presented by leading astrophysicist <u>Mario Livio</u> in his article “Why <u>Math</u> Works”[^26]

In that article, he refers to those who believe <u>math</u> was discovered as <u>Platonists</u>, due to the fact that <u>Platonic</u> <u>archetypes</u> include <u>math</u> <u>archetypes</u>, as <u>math</u> is a form of an idea.  Livio gets into the idea that <u>math</u> is subject to the same <u>evolutionary</u> forces as <u>species</u> in that <u>math</u> that does not <u>work</u> quickly dies, never again to propagate itself into the mathematical “gene pool”.

The same is true for any idea or theory.  <u>Ideas</u> such as the *<u>phlogiston</u>* theory of <u>fire</u> and <u>Descartes</u>’ theory of the motion of <u>planets</u> are examples of <u>conceptual</u> offspring that were quickly dispatched by the deadly and merciless hand of proof.  It’s a bit different on the social level, where we see failed political and <u>economic</u> ideologies that, although their ruin is inevitable from the start, they continue to pop up, because, in the realms of ideology, proof is often eclipsed by belief, hope, power and <u>mass</u> hysteria.

A sounder argument that <u>reason</u> was discovered is that the systems we have created with our reasoning abilities, from plumbing to artificial <u>intelligence</u> (AI), have come to the same design conclusion as <u>nature</u> when faced with similar challenges, such as water distribution, blood <u>cell</u> design, <u>language</u>, etc.  In the case of <u>AI</u>, armed with our rules of <u>reason</u>, it has significantly out-designed human solutions many times by mimicking nature.  These improved solutions were derived at by observing the situation and applying the <u>laws</u> of <u>reason</u> that we instructed the <u>AI</u> system with, <u>laws</u> that we ourselves derived from observing our reality.  The fact that <u>AI</u> is coming up with solutions that not only exceed ours but are more in harmony with <u>nature</u> is pretty good evidence that the <u>laws</u> of <u>reason</u> are objectively verifiable and existed before <u>humans</u> arrived on the scene.

In any case, both sides can agree, for the most part, that <u>math</u> is the <u>language</u> man invented to describe the existing <u>laws</u> he discovered and likewise, reasoning is the process man invented to describe the unfolding <u>order</u> of <u>existence</u> that he was capable of perceiving.  This is a sufficiently satisfactory answer with regard to <u>math</u> and <u>reason</u>, but reasoning, in general, has a lot more gray area than mathematics.

## The Limits of <u>Reason</u>

<u>Reason</u> has been pretty effective in describing our <u>reality</u>, but it has its limits, at least in the way we use it today.

For example, the traditional <u>Law</u> of Thought[^27] goes something like:

- The **<u>Law</u> of Non-Contradiction** states:

> “Nothing can both exist and not exist at the same time and in the same respect, or no statement is both true and false.”

- The **<u>Law</u> of Excluded Middle** states:

> “Something either exists or does not exist, or every statement is either true or false.”

- The **<u>Law</u> of Identity** states:

> “Everything is the same as itself, or a statement cannot remain the same and change its <u>truth</u> value.”

These <u>laws</u> are much like <u>math</u> and have their own algebraic notation: ∼(p&sdot;∼p), F(x)&sup;F(x), (&forall;x) (x=x),  respectively.

It seems reasonable to assert that these <u>laws</u> existed before we came up with a way to define them, just as processes in <u>nature</u> existed before we understood them.  We certainly did not invent the fact that something cannot “be” and “not be” at the same time.  We discovered that this is a property of our <u>reality</u>, or rather, in the way we perceive our reality.  If we broaden our perceptions to include the <u>reality</u> that something *can be* and *cannot be* at the same time, then our reasoning must adapt.

A hardcore <u>Aristotelian</u> materialist might say “The <u>law</u> of non-contradiction specifically forbids something to be in a state of <u>existence</u> and non-existence.  If something exists, it cannot be otherwise.”, while a <u>Platonist</u> might say something can exist as an <u>archetype</u> but not as a material instance.  A scientist might suggest that something can exist implicitly, but not explicitly, like the ink drop, or can even be in two places at the same time, as we have seen in <u>quantum mechanics</u>, and a Hindu guru might mess everything up by saying “<u>The One from which all emerges</u> is both *Sat* (existing) and *Asat* (non-existing)”.

It would appear that the <u>laws</u> of <u>reason</u> depend on the <u>scope</u> of one’s perspective and what one accepts as axiomatic or true, <u>transcendental</u> or otherwise.  How, then, can these <u>laws</u> be preexisting if they contradict each other? This is sort of like the 2,500 year-old <u>Buddhist</u> parable of the *blind men and the <u>elephant</u>* where one blind man holding the <u>elephant</u>’s tail describes it as a snake, and the other, holding the foot, describes it as a tree, or perhaps like the brilliant sculptures of <u>Mathew Robert Ortis</u>, such as “Revolution Giraffes”, which looks like a giraffe from one angle, but an <u>elephant</u> from another.

<center><img src='../Images/016-eleph-giraf.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The blind men and the viewers of the sculpture are all perceiving a preexisting form that is undebatably “true”, but they can’t seem to agree on what it is.  Each of these fine folks can easily define and defend their worldview.  They are all able to recognize the <u>reality</u> they have accepted as true, supported by the reasoning of that truth.

### Labels and Names

In all cases, before one can proclaim some thing’s <u>existence</u>, that thing has to be named and something about it must be known, or at least presumed.  This claim is not only based in psychology, but <u>neurology</u> as well.  We can’t say something exists if we have no idea what it is we are making that claim about.  We can see this readily in the way languages form <u>ideas</u> and labels which become the foundation of <u>cultural</u> understanding.  In some <u>cultures</u>, such as the <u>Mayans</u>, it is believed that things come into being by first being spoken of and named. 

I can say my dog exists because I know *my* dog, I know *of* <u>dogs</u>, and everyone I know also knows of dogs.  But can I say *<u>phlimquitz</u>* exist, and when you ask me what a *<u>phlimquitz</u>* is, I say “I have no idea”? That would be quite unreasonable, but if I said *<u>phlimquitz</u>* explains the 99.97% correlation between “U.S. Spending on <u>science</u>, space and technology vs. <u>Suicide</u> by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation”, then <u>I am</u> claiming to understand something heretofore unknown and can go about defining and testing the *<u>Phlimquitz</u> Hypothesis*.

#### **Key 36:** We name things according to our observations, and once named, they become <u>conceptual</u> realities.



Here is that correlation, just for fun:[^28]

<center><img src='../Images/018-star-dancer.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This process of <u>understanding</u> is similar to recognizing a <u>pattern</u> in a series of <u>random</u> dots, as in the dancing-woman-in-the-dots example above (right).  In that image I can definitely see a person dancing, and I can easily prove it by connecting the dots.  <u>I am</u> not wrong, but neither is the person who sees an egg sandwich.

This ability to recognize <u>patterns</u> exists in our neurology.  However, predictions either of us makes as to where the next dot will land or in determining the properties and attributes of the dots, based on the <u>understanding</u> of our perceptions, will most likely fail.  Through trial and error, testing, and proofs, we will finally discover that these dots represent no specific pattern.  Once we recognize the <u>concept</u> of <u>randomness</u>, we can name it, define it, and study it.

<u>Humans</u> began grasping this <u>concept</u> of <u>randomness</u> about 3,000 years ago, but named it things like “fate”, “chance”, and “destiny”, and, being unpredictable, was usually associated with some sort of supernatural justice or punishment.  It wasn’t until the 16<sup>th</sup> century that Italian mathematicians began to formalize the <u>concept</u> of what we call <u>randomness</u>, so it’s still quite a young concept.

#### **Key 37:** Our ability to <u>reason</u> is rooted in our ability to see <u>patterns</u>, and connecting these <u>patterns</u> is made possible by our ability to reason.

God(s), angels, spirits, the Djinn, magic, luck, coincidence, mystical forces, kundalini, chi, manna, out-of-body-experiences[^29], etc., are all <u>concepts</u> that many people have a clear <u>understanding</u> of, and as such, they are able to say it exists because they cannot only recognize it but can produce reams of <u>information</u> about it.  To be clear, this is not meant to suggest these observations are, or are not, as valid as any other.  Any system’s validity depends solely on the contextual effectiveness of the reasoning behind it and the ability of that reasoning to produce verifiably accurate statements about it.

It would be hubris to write-off alternative views of <u>reality</u> given every <u>culture</u> in the world has a <u>concept</u> of some sort of paranormal or metaphysical reality.  Some of these <u>cultures</u> have extremely demanding training and lengthy education to tap into it.  Even our western icons, such as <u>Paracelsus</u>, <u>Hippocrates</u>, <u>Plato</u>, Carl <u>Jung</u>, Erwin <u>Schrödinger</u>, and Albert <u>Einstein</u> have referred to it.

For better or worse, it seems that pretty much anything can be a <u>Truth</u> as long as people can recognize it and support it with whatever sort of reasoning they happen to be using, even if that <u>reason</u> appears as madness.  For our purposes, we are only concerned with reasoning that is based on the <u>laws</u> of <u>nature</u>, as they are perceived.  We need only look at history, and some places on the <u>planet</u> today, to see the many versions of <u>truth</u> that have evolved, and how dramatically they differ from each other.

### The <u>Truth</u> about <u>Truth</u>

This raises the Big Question… What is <u>truth</u>?

This is a question we can never answer absolutely.  We can’t speak about what the ultimate <u>truth</u> is because there can never be absolute proof that any one way of looking at something is the “right” way.  All we can speak about is what is the most reasonable <u>understanding</u> given the context of our <u>reality</u> and our perceptions of it.  What, then, is the arbiter of proof as to whether something is “reasonably” true or not, given our current <u>understanding</u> of <u>reality</u>?

One arbiter is, of course, power.  When Friedrich <u>Nietzsche</u> said “There is no <u>truth</u>, only power”, he was half right.  <u>Truth</u> is a journey of discovery, while power is a battle for who gets to navigate that journey.

### <u>Sustainability</u>

Outside of that battlefield of <u>culture</u> and <u>politics</u>, we do have at least one gauge, and that is the measure of sustainability.  <u>Sustainability</u> may be the best test as to the validity of something because its explicit <u>existence</u> alone is proof it exists in accordance with the rules of reality.

Anything that exists can only sustain its <u>existence</u> if it exist within the constraints of its <u>scope</u>, typically defined by its environment and its component parts.  A functional <u>balance</u> must be maintained between all <u>contributing</u> variables in <u>order</u> for the <u>energy</u> within that instance to move in a <u>structured</u> manner that allows <u>order</u> to emerge from chaos.  <u>Energy</u> always seeks to achieve a balance; therefore, <u>sustainability</u> is the measure of the degree that <u>order</u> and <u>balance</u> can be maintained.  Unsustainability will result in <u>chaos</u>, and visa-versa.

#### **Key 38:** <u>Sustainability</u> is the measure of the degree that <u>order</u> and <u>balance</u> can be maintained.

This raises an interesting question: if (high-entropy) <u>chaos</u> is the ultimate state of the <u>Universe</u>, a state where everything is inert, motionless and dead, then it must also be the most <u>sustainable</u> state as it will never change once arrived at.  Oddly, this appears to be true, but this is also an example of the two kinds of *<u>balance</u>*.  The dead state is the state of *<u>balance</u>* (noun) that has no <u>movement</u>, which is the opposite of the action of *<u>balance</u>* (verb), which is a dynamic and interactive process of <u>energy</u> and movement.  This raises another point: if the dead state of high-entropy <u>chaos</u>, which has no <u>order</u>, is the most <u>sustainable</u>, then <u>order</u> itself can only be a temporary state,  This appears to be true, as well as the implication that <u>order</u> can only exist in a state of imbalance.  So, when we talk about sustainability. we’re referring to the <u>sustainability</u> of <u>order</u>, which can only be in the temporary context of *<u>balancing</u>*, and not the context of the *<u>balanced</u>* end state.

All the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> that exists at every level of <u>reality</u> is the result of <u>energy</u> traveling the path of least <u>resistance</u> as it seeks balance. We see examples of this everywhere, such as when we mix acid and alkaline, such as vinegar and baking soda, or the more dramatic (and dangerous) example of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide.  After an extremely violent readjustment phase that releases a lot of <u>energy</u> (heat), it settles down to the very stable, lower energy-demanding products of water and table salt.  Why does this reaction happen in the first place? Because the final combined state of water and salt requires less <u>energy</u> to sustain than the separate solutions, specifically, 57 kilojoules per mole (about 4 teaspoons), which is the amount of <u>energy</u> a person would use to run 500 miles!  The <u>energy</u> that is released is the amount of <u>energy</u> the new solution no longer needs to sustain itself

The <u>Universe</u>, starting with the extremely violent <u>Big Bang</u> and ending (according to at least one popular theory) as a bunch of inert matter, the cosmic equivalent of water and table salt, is essentially the readjustment phase of different states of imbalance coming to terms with one another.  <u>Reality</u> is the reaction of this adjustment, and like the chemical reaction just mentioned, will ultimately <u>balance</u> out and just sit there, doing nothing.

When the great <u>Zen</u> master Shunryu <u>Suzuki</u> said “*<u>Life</u> is like stepping onto a boat which is about to sail out to sea and sink.*” he wasn’t being darkly poetic.  He was explaining how <u>reality</u> works.  The ultimate destination of <u>sustainability</u>, on the cosmic scale, is death.  In our current point in <u>existence</u>, <u>sustainability</u> means keeping the various parts of the “<u>balancing</u> machine” of <u>nature</u> working properly.  In both cases, <u>sustainability</u> means <u>balance</u>, but with two very different results of short-term, or *temporal* <u>balance</u> and long-term, or *supernal* balance.  For our purposes, the <u>sustainability</u> we are referring to is the temporal kind, unless otherwise noted.

#### **Key 39:** <u>Sustainability</u> is a gauge of <u>existence</u>, and therefore <u>life</u> itself, at every level of reality.

<u>Pions</u> exist for about 26 nanoseconds, while the most massive <u>black hole</u> known, approximately 66 billion times larger than our Sun, would require 6x10<sup>99</sup> years to evaporate.  Does this mean that <u>black holes</u> are more “valid”, more “true” than <u>pions</u>? No, because the pion’s <u>existence</u>, short as it is, is inevitable, otherwise the forces that caused it into <u>existence</u> would not have done so, but the validity of a pion, essentially the <u>truth</u> of its explicit <u>existence</u>, is only valid for 26 nanoseconds while the validity of a <u>black hole</u> is forever (as 6x10<sup>99</sup> years may actually be longer than the <u>life</u> span of the <u>Universe</u>).  By this logic, we can say that both <u>pions</u> and <u>black holes</u> are equally true and valid, but one’s *<u>truth</u>* is <u>sustainable</u> for a bit longer.

#### **Key 40:** Something exists because its expression of <u>energy</u> <u>patterns</u> adheres to an <u>order</u> that must be maintained for that thing to continue existing.

### Tree of <u>Sustainability</u>

Let’s take a look at a more integrated example; that of a single <u>cell</u>, the building block of life.  This is high-school <u>biology</u>, but let’s go over it again.

Each of these processes has proven itself to be a more “valid” <u>truth</u> by being more <u>sustainable</u> then any of their alternative processes.

Inside the <u>cell</u> are two meters of <u>tightly wound strands</u> of 4 very specific <u>molecules</u>, held together by sugar phosphates, which make up the <u>DNA</u> of that cell.  These are C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub> ​(adenine), C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O (guanine), C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O (cytosine) and C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>  (thymine).  They are arranged in a very specific <u>order</u> which describes the instructions necessary to build every <u>protein</u> in an organism.

- In a process known as transcription, a molecular machine first unwinds a section of the <u>DNA</u> helix to expose the genetic instructions needed to assemble a specific <u>protein</u> molecule.
- Another machine then copies these instructions to form a molecule known as messenger RNA.
- When transcription is complete, the <u>RNA</u> strand carries the genetic <u>information</u> through the nuclear pore complex, the gatekeeper for traffic in and out of the <u>cell</u> nucleus.
- The messenger <u>RNA</u> strand is directed to a two-part molecular factory called a ribosome.
- After attaching itself securely, the process of translation begins.
- Inside the <u>ribosome</u>, a molecular assembly line builds a specifically sequenced chain of amino acids.
- These <u>amino acids</u> are transported from other parts of the cell.
- They are linked into chains often hundreds of units long.  Their sequential arrangement determines the type of <u>protein</u> manufactured.
- When the chain is finished it is moved from the <u>ribosome</u> to a barrel-shaped machine.
- It is then folded into the precise shape critical to its function.
- After the train is folded into a <u>protein</u> it is then released and shepherded by another molecular machine to the exact location where it is needed.

These processes, and their <u>order</u>, are so specific, so complex, so difficult to explain with current <u>evolutionary</u> models, that <u>Dean Kenyon</u>, a Professor Emeritus of <u>Biology</u> at San Francisco State University who actually taught <u>Evolutionary</u> Theory, switched teams in 1979 and went on to be a key member in the “<u>Intelligent Design</u>” movement.

The important point here is that if any one thing in the list of processes listed above changes, if one <u>atom</u> in the C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>5</sub> molecule was different, or the “gatekeeper” made a bad call or a thousand other possibilities, the <u>cell</u> would either die, mutate, or otherwise become unsustainable, making the larger organism unsustainable.  This is actually what <u>cancer</u> is, the malformed reproduction of <u>cells</u> that reduce organism’s sustainability.  Interestingly, the <u>cancer</u> <u>cell</u> itself can be quite <u>sustainable</u> as an independent <u>cell</u> and only becomes a problem as a community of cells.

For a <u>cell</u> to be <u>sustainable</u>, to continue existing, only one process, made up of numerous detailed steps, all of which must function properly, will result in successful functioning and reproduction.  More importantly, we can’t explain why any one particular option in any step, out of the countless theoretical options available at each step, is the one step that the process “knows” to select.

To put this in even clearer perspective, using twenty different <u>amino acids</u> to create a very small <u>protein</u> (of 150 <u>amino acids</u>), there are 10<sup>77</sup> possible combinations.  In the world of <u>biology</u>, this exponential growth of possibilities is called *<u>combinatorial inflation</u>*.  Remember that term, as we’ll come back to it later on.  How many of these 10<sup>77</sup> possibilities can produce a viable <u>protein</u>? Very few, and of those few only one will <u>work</u>, that being the one that works with the others it must integrate with.  It’s not quite as bad as the likelihood of a million <u>monkeys</u> banging on a million typewriters to eventually produce the entire works of Shakespeare, but considering it would take 2,737,850 million-billion-billion-billion <u>monkey-years to produce</u> the line from Hamlet “RUMOUR.  Open your ears”[^30], how likely is the chance that this 1:10<sup>77</sup> process could happen successfully 10<sup>40</sup> times, which is the <u>number</u> of organisms that have ever existed in the history of the <u>planet</u>? For <u>life</u> to evolve (in the Darwinian sense) as it has over the past 4.5 billion years, this 1:10<sup>77</sup> process would need to happen 7x10<sup>99</sup> times per second, which equates to every living thing on the <u>planet</u> today performing this process 7x10<sup>74</sup> times per second! If the vast majority of the 34 trillion <u>cells</u> that make up your body didn’t all hit the jackpot of creating the *same* viable <u>life</u> for millions, if not billions of times a second, <u>life</u> would have never evolved past the bio-goo stage.  Admittedly, these <u>numbers</u> may be inaccurate due to their speculative <u>nature</u>, but the general idea that <u>evolution</u> as a genetic crapshoot sounds far more unreasonable.

What we call a <u>cell</u> is a <u>collective</u> of components that not only all <u>work</u> together with miraculous precision, but which seems to have an <u>intelligence</u> of its own that understands the requirements of how each component must operate with all the other components in <u>order</u> to preserve and maintain its <u>sustainability</u>, its existence.  Likewise, the components themselves, like the barrel-shaped machine and the transcriptors, are also made of components that have the same intentions and decision-making abilities.

<u>Evolutionists</u> will say that all the other options, at one time in our past, were tried, and failed, leaving only the process that worked.  Intelligent Designers will say that this was “<u>biochemical predeterminism</u>”, i.e.  that the process was pre-programmed, somehow.  Both of these answers are just kicking the can down the road, that “can” being the question of where and how this historical record of what worked and what didn’t <u>work</u> is stored along with the <u>knowledge</u> of a very strict set of rules and conditions that informs the process, as well as how this <u>data</u> is accessed.

Let’s take a look at a couple of macro examples on the social human scale and examine the serious questions it raises about the way we understand it.

### <u>Yagé</u>

This ritual psychoactive drink from the <u>Amazon</u> is also known as *<u>ayahuasca</u>*, *<u>uni</u>*, *nixi pãe*, *<u>caapi</u>*, *<u>camarampi</u>*, and many other names as well.  One of the more fascinating details about <u>yagé</u> is how it is made and how it was discovered in the first place.  The main active ingredient of <u>yagé</u> is N, N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT).  DMT is a powerful hallucinogenic drug that exists in plants (and the human <u>brain</u>) yet has no effect on <u>humans</u> when taken orally because of the enzyme *monoamine oxidase* (MAO) in our blood that prevents it from passing the blood/brain barrier, which is a semipermeable membrane that separates the blood from the cerebrospinal fluid and which blocks many <u>cells</u>, particles, and large <u>molecules</u>, from entering the brain.  This is a very good thing, as there is a lot of stuff floating around in our blood that can really mess with the brain.

In <u>order</u> for the DMT to get to the <u>brain</u>, it has to pass through the blood/brain barrier, and for that to happen there must be something that stops the MAOs from doing their job.  That thing is called a *MAO Inhibitor* (MAOI).  MAOIs are commonly used in pharmaceuticals to help with ailments such as depression and Parkinson’s <u>disease</u> (which, according to Stanford University, are the same two things that tango dancing also helps).

Modern <u>science</u> has known about both of these drugs for a little over 100 years.  Indigenous Amazonian shamans have known about them for about 5,000 years.  Somehow, in a manner beyond the ability of modern Western man to comprehend, these shamans managed to discover that the bark of one particular vine, from over 40,000 <u>species</u> of plants, contained a lot of DMT.  They also, somehow, knew that an <u>MAOI</u> was needed, which they found in another of those 40,000 species.  On top of all this, they had to know to stop eating meat, fish, milk, fruit, bread, and anything fermented for some days before taking the <u>MAOI</u> lest they suffer serious injury and/or death.  Traditional anthropologists would have you believe they discovered this by trial and error, but with just a little thought, it is clear how ridiculous that theory is.

Of the 1,600,000,000 possible pairing combinations of Amazonian plants, only one produces the basis of <u>yagé</u> (it’s actually far more complicated to make <u>yagé</u> than just mixing these two plants), and even then, only when a certain part of the plants are used.  In addition, these 1,600,000,000 possibilities do not consider the variables of proportion or the specifics of preparation.  For that many trial-and-error tests, even if every man, woman, and child in all of modern-day South America partook in the finding, preparing, and experimenting, it would take over 2,000 years, which then raises the question of record-keeping as to what was already tested.  The fact that modern <u>science</u> expects any semi-intelligent person to believe its trial-and-error theory is laughable, but also pretty frightening that so many scientists *do* believe this.

### <u>Curare</u>

For other substances, such as the paralyzing poison *<u>curare</u>* used by South American indigenous people for hunting, the chances are astronomically greater.

<u>Curare</u> is a poison that paralyzes an animal, but soon after being paralyzed the poison is metabolized by the animal, rendering it harmless.  That is obviously a pretty essential requirement, as you can’t be eating the same poison you used to catch the animal.  Just imagining that the locals knew of this requirement and then set out to find such a drug somewhere in the <u>Amazon</u> is difficult for modern anthropologists to accept.

Beyond that, there are 172 different types of this one-in-40000 <u>species</u> in the jungle, and only one of them works, but the real kicker is that the fumes one is exposed to while preparing the <u>curare</u> are fatal! How does modern <u>science</u> imagine this was achieved?

> *Wanadi:* “Trumak! Mojie just died testing that new batch of <u>curare</u>!”
>
> *Trumak:* “Bummer.  And he was so close! Go and try that again, with the same batch… and remember to keep smelling it.  That’s how you know it’s done.”
>
> Wanadi: “OK!”

On the other hand, if one were to ask a shaman how these things were discovered, he would simply say, “The plants told us”. Other <u>cultures</u> who have similar stories might say their ancestors told them, or the crickets, or the bones of a sacred animal, or the cracks in the shell of a tortoise after it has been heated and then dropped into cold water and then compared to the position of the stars, as was the case with the origins of the Chinese *I-Ching.*

## Ancient Mysteries

There's another example, and one that has greater implications than simply refuting the idea that <u>life</u> is the result of trillions of simultaneous fortunate coincidences.  This is shared because it appears to be another example where the theory of an *uber* <u>intelligence</u> gives more answers than the current mainstream scientific theory that boils down to essentially "Just lucky, I guess?", but unfortunately, my limited <u>knowledge</u> of the subject permits me to only raise the question.

Consider the human's 23 pairs of <u>chromosomes</u> <u>versus the 24</u> pairs of our primate ancestors.  How is it that higher primates can have one extra pair of <u>chromosomes</u> than their more “evolved” descendants? Because 4.5 million years ago, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> <u>chromosomes</u> of some primate fused together in such a way to create one <u>chromosome</u> pair that did the job of two.  

I say “evolved” in quotes because it may seem intuitive to think that the more <u>chromosomes</u> a <u>species</u> has, the more “evolved” they are, but were that the case, the <u>Hermit Crab</u>, with 254 <u>chromosome</u> pairs, would be the pinnacle of <u>evolution</u> on this planet.

We are not concerned with the significance of 23 vs. 24 <u>chromosome</u> pairs but with the unlikeliness of <u>fusion</u> being the result of a <u>random</u> mutation.

So, our 2nd <u>chromosome</u> does the same thing as the 2nd and 3rd <u>chromosomes</u> of our ancestors.

Mainstream <u>science</u> refers to this chromosomal abnormality as a *<u>Robertsonian translocation</u>*.  This *translocation* happens in about 1 out of every 1000 babies and is usually associated with genetic disorders and syndromes.  This type of genetic mutation is different from a mutation in the <u>DNA</u> itself or even in the genes that the <u>DNA</u> form.  This mutation exists in the highest <u>structure</u> of genetics, the <u>chromosome</u>, which is why chromosomal mutations are usually fatal, and those that are not fatal tend to manifest as Down syndrome, leukemia, and other less-than-ideal side-effects.  As genetic mutations go, a chromosomal mutation that results in an <u>evolutionary</u> leap is as likely as surviving a fall from 30,000 feet and landing on the winning lottery ticket in downtown Shangri-La.

Still, *<u>Robertsonian translocation</u>* does a terrible job of explaining the minus-one <u>chromosome</u> that resulted in humans.   Typically, a *<u>Robertsonian translocation</u>* is when a part of one <u>chromosome</u> breaks off and gets attached to some part of another <u>chromosome</u>, but our 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>chromosome</u> is not simply a broken part of one <u>chromosome</u> attached to another; rather, it is a perfectly functioning set of merged chromosomes.

To suggest that this <u>fusion</u> was a *<u>Robertsonian translocation</u>*, we'd first have to accept that there was one primate that had this genetic abnormality who was lucky enough to mate with another primate that had this exact same abnormality (because 23-pair and 24-pair primates cannot reproduce), and that these two primates, and only these two primates, were responsible for the entire human race, that is unless we also accept that somewhere else on the <u>planet</u> there was another pair of primates with the exact same mutation that mated. Of course, for this mutation to continue, the children of these two identically mutated proto-humans would have to only reproduce with their siblings... forever.

But let's suspend <u>reason</u> for a moment and pretend that happened and that <u>humans</u> are, in fact, the results of 4.5 million years of mutated inbreeding.

<u>Telomeres</u> are a section of <u>DNA</u> that cap the ends of our <u>chromosomes</u>, similar to tying a knot at the end of a string to keep it from fraying.

Centromeres are segments of <u>DNA</u> located in-between the <u>telomeres</u>, usually near the middle of a <u>chromosome</u> (hence, the name), and they are critical to successful <u>cell</u> division.

So, <u>telomeres</u> are at the tips of a <u>chromosome</u>, and centromeres are in the center, normally.  In the case of the human's fused 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>chromosome</u>, there are 4 <u>telomeres</u>, one at each end, and 2 in the center, which we'd expect if we fused to complete <u>chromosomes</u> together.  Imagine taking 2 pencils, both sharpened at both ends,  and putting them end to end; you'd have 2 tips, one at each and, and 2 tips connected in the center. There are also 2 centromeres, one at each center of each pencil. So now we have a <u>chromosome</u> that has the 'stopping' <u>telomeres</u> in the center as well as two "growing' centromeres.  This should spell <u>DNA</u> disaster, but it doesn't!  Why, because, by the miracle of impossible luck, one of the two centromeres and both central inner <u>telomeres</u> happens to be deactivated.

There actually exists a lively debate between geneticists regarding the origins of the human 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>chromosome</u> and the reasons why/how it proved to be an <u>evolutionary</u> advantage, and therefore why it was able to spread among the gene pool.  Outside of the mainstream arguments, there is also the hypothesis that our 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>chromosome</u> was intentionally engineered by a visiting race that also had 23 <u>chromosomes</u>, and by making a 23-pair ape, these visitors were able to add some of their own genetic traits to the new <u>hybrid</u> they just created.

The question we ask here is not what is "true" or not, but which model provides a better <u>understanding</u>, i.e., which theory has better test-results and predictions, regardless whether it was <u>aliens</u>, natural <u>radiation</u>, or the ingestion of genetically altering edibles.

This same reasoning, I believe, applies to so many of the ancient mysteries that are inexplicable within our current <u>understanding</u>, and not only cosmic mysteries, but technical as well[^306]. The fantastic details and specificity of the Babylonian creation story (the *<u>Enuma Elish</u>*), the <u>Vedic</u> scriptures, the <u>Epic of Gilgamesh</u>, and other compelling evidence from <u>cultures</u> around the world that speak of other intelligences at play, suggest that mankind had access to an <u>intelligence</u> (and/or an <u>intelligence</u> had access to man) beyond what we currently believe was possible.

For Western man, talking to plants, insects, bones, or <u>aliens</u> in this manner is usually followed by pharmaceuticals prescribed by a psychiatrist.  For just about every other indigenous <u>culture</u>, including the indigenous <u>culture</u> that Western civilization grew from, they had some way to tap into this organic database of <u>knowledge</u>, and perhaps more importantly, they accepted that such a thing was not only possible, but necessary.

Just as a <u>cellular</u> transcriptor has the <u>intelligence</u> necessary to manage its <u>sustainability</u>, which is then managed by the <u>intelligence</u> of a <u>cell</u>, and up the chain this continues all the way to a human being (which is just a stop along the journey, as we <u>humans</u> are part of a yet larger system), it is not unreasonable to presume there is an *uber*-intelligence that manages its components of humans.

Our ancestors called this <u>intelligence</u> “the voice of the <u>gods</u>” and about 5,000 years ago we started to create the idea of an all-in-one-version of the gods.  This was a very practical idea and worked very well given the context and <u>scope</u> of our ancestor’s world view.  It gave one name to all things unknown and satisfied their need for a sense of <u>truth</u> and order.  Once named it was left to <u>humans</u> to try and describe that <u>truth</u> and order.

## The Human <u>Brain</u> and <u>Reason</u>

The American Psychologist Julian <u>Jaynes</u> proposed a revolutionary thesis in his book titled “*The Origin of <u>Consciousness</u> in the Breakdown of the <u>Bicameral</u> Mind”* (1976) wherein he explains that during a recent stage in the <u>evolution</u> of not only our ancestor’s <u>brain</u> but the entire nervous system, we, as <u>humans</u>, had the ability to hear voices in our heads instructing us on what we needed to do and needed to know, and these voices of unknown origin were attributed to the “<u>gods</u>”, and therefore became the voice of Truth.

<center><img src='../Images/019-bicameral-brain.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

>“Who then were these <u>gods</u> that pushed men about like robots and sang epics through their lips? They were voices whose speech and directions could be as distinctly heard by the Iliadic heroes as voices are heard by certain epileptic and schizophrenic patients, or just as Joan of Arc heard her voices.  The <u>gods</u> were organizations of the central nervous system and can be regarded as personae in the sense of poignant consistencies through time, amalgams of parental or admonitory images.  The <u>god</u> is a part of the man, and quite consistent with this <u>conception</u> is the fact that the <u>gods</u> never step outside of natural laws.”[^31]

<u>Jaynes</u> claims that a bit before 1000 B.C. (just around the time of the Tower of Babel by Sumerian accounts) the human <u>consciousness</u> was not yet “meta-conscious”, meaning <u>humans</u> were not aware of their awareness.  The <u>bicameral</u> part of <u>Jaynes</u> theory suggests that there were two parts of the <u>brain</u>, the one that managed mundane jobs, habits, rote tasks, etc.  (the self), and another part which, when faced with confusing and/or difficult challenges, took over (the voice of <u>god</u>).

> [For <u>bicameral</u> humans], volition came as a voice that was in the <u>nature</u> of a neurological command, in which the command and the action were not separated, in which to hear was to obey.

*Sidenote: What we call the “<u>ego</u>” today evolved out of that really boring and mundane “self” part of the <u>brain</u>, so it’s probably best not to use it for anything other than mundane tasks.*

According to <u>Jaynes</u>, the transition from bicameralism to <u>consciousness</u> (linguistic meta-cognition) occurred over the period from 1800 B.C. to 800 B.C.  We know this time as the time from when <u>Hammurabi</u> ruled <u>Babylon</u>, and when he wrote down one of the first set of <u>laws</u> known to humanity dealing with challenging and confusing issues such as contracts, wages, liability, inheritance, divorce, paternity, and reproductive behavior, to name a few, to the founding of Rome.  This metamorphosis of <u>consciousness</u> ushered in the golden age of empires and <u>cultures</u> that laid the foundation of Western Civilization in areas of art, literature, theater, <u>government</u>, philosophy, mathematics, and even sports.  (*<u>I am</u> singling out Western <u>culture</u> simply because that is the <u>culture</u> I best understand and which has the most <u>information</u> available, and not because I think other <u>cultures</u> have not developed along their own lines under similar conditions.)*

From the days of Rome and the ancient Greek philosophers to today, our bicameralism has further diminished, which can account for the decreasing incidents of people hearing the <u>gods</u> speak to them.  This may have been a “good” thing, but the problem that arose as a result of the <u>gods</u> abandoning us, forcing us to apply <u>reason</u> to challenging problems when our pleas for guidance were ignored, is that our newly developed <u>tools</u> of <u>reason</u> were prone to reject any <u>ideas</u> that we could not understand, which were many, given we were still new at the whole reasoning thing during some very desperate times.  Our fledgling ability to consciously make sense of things seemed to be working, so it naturally dominated our world view, even if we were, and are, still figuring out how it works.  This was the birth of *human* <u>intelligence</u> (as opposed to universal <u>intelligence</u>).  <u>Lao Tzu</u> refers to this time in our history as:

>  When men lost their <u>understanding</u> of the <u>Tao</u>, <u>intelligence</u> came along, bringing hypocrisy with it.

Still, as <u>Jaynes</u> so eloquently puts it:

> The mind is still haunted with its old unconscious ways; it broods on lost authorities; and the yearning, the deep and hollowing yearning for divine volition and service is with us still.

Hence, religion.

Anything and everything that did not fit into the highly constrained and “reasonable” worldview was pushed farther and farther outside the box of mainstream thought until we arrived at where we are today.  In one way this “inquisition-by-reason”, which served to purge heretical thoughts from the dogma of the cult of <u>reason</u>, was, and is, quite necessary and useful, because in the reformation that has begun, those ancient <u>ideas</u> that can withstand the tests of our deeper <u>understanding</u> of <u>reason</u> will be resurrected in a new form with a broader and more integrated understanding.

The <u>memories</u> of the <u>cell</u>, the voices in our ancestor’s heads, the wisdom of the plants as heard by the shamans, and countless other instances of “divine” or “mystical” <u>knowledge</u>, all beg the same questions: Where does this <u>information</u> come from? Where is it stored? How does one access it?

Perhaps *<u>reason</u>* has evolved to the point where we may be able to answer these questions, reasonably.

## The Path of <u>Reason</u>

The rules and conditions of <u>reality</u> that we have discovered have followed a perfectly reasonable path long before man was able to claim them as such.  Sometimes it takes a while to find them, but eventually, we do, so far.

<center><img src='../Images/020-planet-logs.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

For thousands of years, Man looked at the path of the stars and came up with various stories about why they were where they were.  It wasn’t until <u>Kepler</u> discovered the <u>pattern</u> by plotting the paths on a logarithmic chart that the reasoning became clear.  This became <u>Kepler</u>’s *Third <u>Law</u> of <u>Planetary</u> Motion* that states *“the square of the <u>planet</u>’s orbital period is proportional to the cube of its distance from the Sun”.* In the same manner, we discovered <u>DNA</u> is a helix because of hydrogen bonds, etc., so we can say “Here is a <u>pattern</u> and the rules that created it ”.

This is not to say everything that the gatekeepers of the Church of <u>Reason</u> consider “unreasonable”, such as <u>myths</u>, magic, <u>aliens</u>, hyper-dimensional beings, and numerous other paranormal, metaphysical <u>concepts</u> are, indeed, “unreasonable”. On the contrary, it’s quite unreasonable to presume they have no reasoning behind them as many of these <u>ideas</u> perfectly conform to natural <u>law</u>, albeit within a <u>scope</u> that extends outside our modern boundaries.  Today we see <u>planets</u> as law-abiding balls in space and <u>DNA</u> as spiraling compounds, but our ancestors saw <u>gods</u> that showed them the way, and spiraling serpents of powerful magic.  Who is to say which is more “true”?  

Historical examples of once unreasonable <u>ideas</u> include <u>electricity</u>, flight, wireless communications, space travel, nuclear <u>energy</u> and pretty much the majority of the <u>reality</u> of modern life.  These things were considered nothing less than magic and <u>science</u> fiction until we were able to discover and recognize the rules of how they worked.  Once we discovered Bernoulli’s <u>law</u>[^32] works in harmony with the <u>law</u> of <u>gravity</u>, we mastered the magic art of flying.

#### **Key 41:** <u>Reason</u> is based on the codification of the rules of a <u>reality</u> as we have come to know it.

### The benevolence of <u>self-preservation</u>

If our reasoning is based on the world we observe, then this implies that everything in <u>nature</u>, everything in the <u>Universe</u>, must, therefore, be “reasonable”, at least according to the <u>laws</u> of <u>existence</u>, but sometimes the reasoning we have derived from our limited observations is inaccurate or lacking.

#### **Key 42:** The rules of <u>reason</u> are predetermined based on the rules of our <u>reality</u> that we have recognized, and these rules require that any “<u>reason</u>” that exists must abide by them.

Take, for example, our reasoning behind the <u>evolutionary</u> drive for self-preservation.  We assume it is a somewhat selfish, yet necessary, biological drive passed down through our genes in <u>order</u> to increase the genes chances of reproducing themselves.  This makes sense if we see the world only as a bunch of individual entities competing for resources.

Another way to see <u>self-preservation</u> is from the perspective of the larger organism that is composed of many <u>contributing</u> organisms.

Take the example of a <u>collective</u>, such as a tribe.  If the <u>collective</u> is destroyed, then all its members also suffer from that loss.  The <u>collective</u>, then, has a strong responsibility to the members.  On the other hand, if the members were to become damaged in some way, the <u>collective</u> suffers as well.  So, the <u>collective</u> will both attempt to preserve itself for the sake of its members and preserve the members for the sake of itself.  We don’t think of a <u>collective</u> as an organism, but all organisms are collectives, therefore collectives *can* be organisms.  Now apply this reasoning to an animal.  The animal will  attempt to preserve itself for the sake of its “members”  (organs, limbs, <u>cells</u>, etc.), and preserve its members for the sake of itself.  In the case of a tree, a tree will attempt to protect itself for the sake of its members which it needs to maintain sustainability.  For example, besides bark and thorns, a tree will emit chemicals that attract the enemies of the invading <u>species</u>, which is pretty amazing when you wonder about how it “knows” how to do that.  A leaf will attempt to protect itself with fine hairs, spines or thorns, bitter and even toxic substances.  We tend to think of a tree as a thing that has a trunk, branches and leaves, but it can also be understood as a <u>collective</u> organism made up of other <u>collective</u> organisms, such as trunk, branch and leaf, each taking care of itself and its immediate children.

From the perspective of the parent organism, such as the <u>collective</u>, it is worth losing a member if that means it will benefit the <u>collective</u> and/or the ability of the <u>collective</u> to preserve its members.

One example of this are the <u>cardiac muscle</u> <u>cells</u> that have the <u>self-preservation</u> ability to duck, dart, and dodge foreign substances, but these actions may harm the <u>cells</u> to the point where they can cause a fatal <u>heart</u> attack, all in an attempt to preserve themselves, even though they are killing their parent organism.

Some theorize that they do this because there is a greater chance of the <u>heart</u> surviving if the <u>cells</u> can avoid damage and hold out for the possibility of the <u>heart</u> being resuscitated.  This may be so, but I wonder just how many successful resuscitations have occurred over the past 520 million years (which is how long ago the <u>heart</u> evolved), at least prior to the invention of CPR in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, otherwise how or why would the <u>heart</u> <u>cell</u> “think” resuscitation was even a possibility? A far more reasonable explanation is that the component elements of a person (the <u>cells</u>, in this case) are compelled to preserve *their* component elements (nucleus, chromatins, cytoplasm, organelles, etc.).  Killing the parent organism is not its concern, nor within the <u>scope</u> of its influence as preservation of the members is the concern of the parent organism, which has obviously failed to protect its components in this case.  The sacrificed parent organism of *person*, which exists within the <u>collective</u> (tribe, community, country, etc.) will only lose one (improperly functioning) member.  With a bit of thought, one might question whether modern <u>medicine</u> is doing a disservice to the larger organism we <u>humans</u> serve, whatever that is.  I suppose history will be the judge.

In this particular example of cardiac <u>cells</u>, their <u>self-preservation</u> can be fatal to the <u>collective</u> (of the *person*), but in most cases losing a few <u>cells</u> is not fatal to a person, and by the same token, the *uber* organism that <u>humans</u> are a part of (family, <u>society</u>, <u>government</u>, etc.) only forfeits one human.  This is happening in our own bodies 60 billion times a day, as that is how many of our own <u>cells</u> die, and are created, every day.

#### **Key 43:** The most efficient model for a <u>collective</u> is individual self-preservation.

Seeing <u>self-preservation</u> more as a protecting-the-family-of-component-parts makes much more sense *if* we also see that every organism in the <u>hierarchy</u> of <u>life</u>, from <u>cells</u> to cities, is an individual entity.

Just as an entity will endanger its parent <u>collective</u> in an attempt to preserve its own members, a (healthy) <u>collective</u> will sacrifice a member for the betterment of the whole.

This perspective also explains how a person is able to sacrifice itself for the sake of another, even though they have no genetic connection to the other person, ruling out genetic preference as is the case when a parent sacrifices themselves for their child.  This would also suggest that our most basic drive is not only the survival of the self, but also the survival of something more important than the self, yet still be self-serving.  We see this in cases of honor, country, <u>god</u>, etc., and other examples common in a collective.

You might be thinking that this is a trait unique to <u>humans</u>, but this is not the case.  We see cases of this in single-cell organisms[^33], multi-cellular organisms[^34] (such as slime mold, where, when faced with scant resources, certain <u>cells</u> will <u>sacrifice themselves for</u> the sake of the greater organism.[^35]), <u>virulent</u> <u>parasites</u>[^36], plants[^37], to name a few.  In <u>society</u>, this is clearly exemplified in soldiers willing to die for their country or ideology, as well as countries willing to send their soldiers into war.

How is going to war an act of <u>self-preservation</u>? It is <u>self-preservation</u> of the entity of *tribe*, and it is the <u>self-preservation</u> of the soldier that makes him useful to the tribe, otherwise he would be a useless soldier.   The soldier is willing to fight for his tribe because his own interests and preservation depends on the tribe, just as a leaf depends on the branch.  There is another factor that is obvious in <u>humans</u> and some animals, and may even exist in all forms of <u>life</u>, and that is *<u>love</u>*.  <u>Humans</u> <u>sacrifice themselves for</u> <u>love</u> of <u>family</u>, country, <u>god</u>, regularly.  This would strongly suggest that <u>love</u> trumps genetic survival as the prime candidate for <u>evolution</u>, a factor that should be considered when looking at <u>evolution</u> (but currently is not).  <u>I am</u> not bold enough to speculate as to what the true <u>nature</u> of <u>love</u> is, other than to say it is the cause of at least one significant effect: commitment. It is this commitment that is of primary importance to the <u>sustainability</u> of the child organisms as well as the parent organisms of <u>family</u>, tribe, and, by extension, god.  This raises an interesting philosophical question;  does <u>god</u> need such commitment to be sustained, just as a tribe or a <u>family</u> needs commitment from its members to be <u>sustainable</u>? Clearly, the <u>sustainability</u> of something depends on some type of commitment from that which it depends on.  

This self-sacrificing quality turns out to be fairly common across <u>life</u> in general.  Quoting the paper published in *the International Academy of Ecology and Environmental Sciences*, “Invasive <u>cancer</u> as an empirical example of <u>evolutionary suicide</u>”[^38] :

> In recent years, a large portion of the literature has focused on <u>evolutionary</u> suicide.  “<u>Darwinian extinction</u>” or <u>evolutionary suicide</u> is one of the most important findings in adaptive dynamics [which inevitably bring us to the conclusion] that <u>evolutionary</u> theory falls short of adequately explaining the phenomenon of <u>life</u> in its fullness and complexity.  This is due to the fact that [evolutionary suicide] is not a rare or special case and that it can occur in the most common ecological conditions.

We also see a less dramatic version of this in genomes which will, rather then commit <u>suicide</u>, reduce their own replication rate to help other genomes.[^39]

As unromantic as it sounds, “<u>evolutionary suicide</u>” is a commitment, an act of <u>love</u>, to the greater organism (not exactly Hallmark material).  Still, this perspective is reasonable and does a better job of explaining how, and why, <u>life</u> operates the way it does.  With <u>ideas</u> such as <u>wave</u> functions and the many-worlds theory of quantum <u>physics</u>, the morphic <u>field</u> of <u>biology</u>, the research into hyper-time <u>telepathic</u> communication (for long-distance space travel), self-determining <u>AI</u>, etc., it’s easy to see how what we accept as “reasonable” will dramatically change as we learn how these new processes of <u>reality</u> and <u>life</u> work.

Some may see this as an example of “<u>Intelligent Design</u>”. We prefer the term “<u>Coherent</u> Integration” to represent an integrated self-similar <u>pattern</u> of moving <u>energy</u> that extends far above and below that sliver of the <u>reality</u> spectrum that we are attuned to perceive.

This idea is similar to the theory that was put forth 250 years ago by the man who not only laid the foundation of modern <u>economics</u> but did so specifically with the idea of eliminating poverty and increasing sustainability.  His name was <u>Adam Smith</u>, and he referred to this power of <u>self-preservation</u> in his *<u>Theory of the Invisible Hand</u>*, described in his book *‘An Inquiry into the <u>Nature</u> and Causes of the Wealth of Nations’* published in 1776.

> The natural <u>effort</u> of every individual to better his own conditions, when suffered to exert itself with freedom and security, is so powerful a principle, that it is alone, and without assistance, not only capable of carrying on the <u>society</u> to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting a hundred impertinent obstructions with which the folly of human <u>laws</u> too often encumber its operations.
>
> It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.  **\~Adam Smith, 1776**

Applying this idea to <u>society</u> also suggests that the most <u>sustainable</u> practice for the world at large can be summed up in a phrase that is attributed to international banks, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Buckminster Fuller and more[^40] :

> Think globally, act locally

This is easily practiced by spending your <u>money</u> at local businesses rather than Walmart or <u>Amazon</u>, or simply, to quote Mother Theresa when asked “What can we do to promote world peace?”, “Go home and <u>love</u> your family.”


#### **Key 44:** There is an <u>order</u> to creative processes, and creations themselves are a product of order.

Given all that was just said, it would be hard to ignore the insane <u>elephant</u> in the room that is rampaging out of control.  <u>Governments</u> are global tribes, and in a healthy system, the <u>government</u> supports its members and the members support their government.  In general, this has been the case, and by “in general” I mean to say that there is a slight edge in favor of healthy <u>governments</u> over unhealthy governments.  We know this because we can see the progress made in <u>concepts</u> of justice and human rights from the Code of <u>Hammurabi</u>, to the <u>Magna Carta</u>, to <u>the Enlightenment</u>, which gave us the U.S. Constitution.

> <u>Ideas</u> of justice and human rights possess a long and rich history. They did not originate exclusively in any single geographical region of the world, any single country, any single century, any single manner, or even any single political form of <u>government</u> or legal system. They emerged instead in many ways from many places, societies, <u>religious</u> and secular traditions, <u>cultures</u>, and different means of expression, over thousands of years. Indeed, they took millennia to evolve, since they always depended upon their specific historical context and what was possible in the face of established tradition and often determined <u>resistance</u>, at the time. **~Dr. <u>Paul Gordon</u> Lauren, historian, “The Foundations of Justice and Human Rights in Early Legal Texts and Thought”**

That “slight edge” leaves a lot of space for a lot of really unhealthy <u>governments</u>, as any historian can attest to.  The modern world of global access has given rise to a new type of tribe, the multinational corporation (MC), that does not answer to those that support it, nor does it have the support of its members.  The MC is more parasitic than synergistic, but parasitism has proven to be a very successful strategy.  These MCs can wield power greater than most <u>governments</u>, and even among the largest <u>governments</u> they have tremendous influence.  Relative to <u>governments</u>, they are efficient, fast, smart, and expanding their leviathan of a global network at malignant rates. This is not the place to go into how <u>governments</u> and MCs have formed a sort of global corporatism that seems to be heading toward a kind of digital neofascism.  In any case, this appears to be a very unsustainable system much in the same way industrial agriculture is unsustainable as both systems destroy the interests and degenerate the abilities of its members (people and plants, respectively).  Both systems will ultimately fail or transform into something else, but as we have seen with various forms of divisive ideologies, it may take a long time to fail or change.

## <u>Cycles</u> & <u>Waves</u>

Let’s return to the <u>concept</u> of oscillations.   The <u>concept</u> of *<u>cycles</u>* is similar to that of *oscillations*.  The difference, at least in the context of this book, is that *oscillations* describe more of the <u>quantitative</u> properties such as <u>frequency</u>, <u>wavelength</u>, etc., while *<u>cycles</u>* refer more to the <u>qualitative</u> values, such as the medium and its effects, value, seasons, <u>life</u>, animal migrations, etc.

One of the most fundamental <u>concepts</u> we have in our attempts to understand <u>reality</u> and the <u>Universe</u> is that of *<u>cycles</u>*, and it is one of the earliest <u>concepts</u> <u>humans</u> explored, and for obvious reasons.

> Everything that has been studied has been found to have <u>cycles</u> present&hellip;  We do not need to know what this <u>force</u> or cause is - it is enough to know that it must be something. We then proceed from there to find it. **~Edward. R. <u>Dewey</u>, Founder of “Foundation for the Study of <u>Cycles</u>” in 1941[^337] and chief <u>economic</u> analyst for the Department of Commerce during the Great Depression**.

<img src='../Images/boom-cycle.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>The Big Cycle is, of course, the cycle of the Universe.  There are a lot of different theories about how the Universe came into being, the most popular being that is began with a Big Bang, but we’re not sure how it will end.  The candidates for the Big Finale are the Big Crunch, the Big Freeze, and the Big Rip.  Of these three, only the Big Crunch is cyclic, causing a new Big Bang.  There’s no recovering from the Big Freeze and Big Rip scenarios.  These are one-cycle-only options. The more sustainable option is the Big Crunch as it delivers unending Big Bangs that occur *inside* black  holes, creating new universes, which have black holes, which create Big Bangs.  Systems within systems, just like the reality we live in.  “But what of it’s wrong?” is then the question.  It’s silly to think that in 1000, 10,000 or 100,000 years we won’t have an entirely different view of how/why reality began and/or will end, so whatever we come up with now (or at any time), is more about reality as we *perceive* it, not as it *really* is.  Still, we have some pretty awesome ideas about creation and reality, such as the *Holographic Theory* and the *Simulation Hypothesis*.  Of course, it may be the case that this reality is “only” a simulation, but that does not take away from its cyclic nature for if it is a simulation, whenever it is simulating is obviously cyclic in nature.

### <u>Holographic</u> theory/simulation hypothesis

The essence of this idea has been around for a long time, probably starting with the first ape who accidentally ate the wrong mushrooms and thought “this is all an illusion!”.  It’s more traditional lineage goes back to the “Skeptical hypotheses” of ancient Greece and the “The Butterfly Dream” of 3<sup>rd</sup> century B.C. Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou.  These <u>ideas</u> found more form in the “Cartesian doubt” of René <u>Descartes</u>, finally culminating in Oxford philosopher <u>Nick Bostrom</u>’s “<u>Simulation</u> hypothesis” theory and book *“Are you living in a computer <u>simulation</u>?”* in 2003 (also a documentary[^41]).

There are actually two ideas; the <u>holographic</u> theory, which can be tested[^338], and the <u>simulation</u> hypothesis (which is like the <u>holographic</u> theory for philosophers, so, much more difficult to test), but as a <u>hologram</u> *is* a <u>simulation</u>, and <u>reality</u> as we know it is already <u>holographic</u>, <u>simulation</u> or not, I've taken the liberty to combine them.  

How is this <u>reality</u> <u>holographic</u>?  

- **<u>Hologram</u>**: creates images by channeling light through <u>patterns</u> formed by the division of one light source into two parts; light, and the light that is a reflection of matter.

- **<u>Universe</u>**: creates things by channeling <u>energy</u> through <u>patterns</u> formed by the division of one <u>energy</u> source into two parts; <u>energy</u> and matter.

This theory that we live in a <u>simulation</u> has moved out of the philosopher’s chair and into the <u>science</u> lab where bits of supporting evidence were discovered.  In this scenario, the <u>Big Bang</u> would be the equivalent of a cosmic hacker flipping the “on” switch to their “<u>Reality</u> Framework Server” and posits that <u>reality</u> is a simulated projection.  These projections come from <u>black holes</u> with its *event horizon* (the point from which nothing escapes) acting as a diffraction grid for the <u>energy</u> it is projecting to form a “<u>reality</u>”, just like a hologram.

We think of this world as analog, but it may well be digital, albeit with a level of resolution far beyond our ability to perceive (which would make sense if one were designing a <u>simulation</u>).  This grid is made up of a series of 1s and 0s, each “bit” occupying a square <u>Planck length</u> (1.616×10<sup>−35</sup> m<sup>2</sup>).  To put this in perspective, the <u>number</u> of “bits” on the surface of *V616 Monocerotis*, our nearest <u>black hole</u> “projector” a mere 3,000 light-years away, is around 2.3313x10<sup>88</sup>.  There are only 10<sup>82</sup> <u>atoms</u> in the <u>Universe</u> (we think), so, that is a big number.  This is just from one of the 100 million <u>black hole</u> projectors in our galaxy alone, and we already know of 500 billion galaxies just within our range of observation, so we know of at least 5 x 10<sup>19</sup> “<u>reality</u> projecting CPUs” (for lack of a better term), that are all working in perfect synchronization, theoretically.

Even more mind-bending is the possibility that the <u>reality</u> that is being projected is only “rendered” on-demand, i.e.,  this <u>reality</u> <u>simulation</u> creates <u>wave</u> functions of possibilities that only “collapse” into form when they are observed.  Apparently, creating actual physical <u>reality</u> is a “CPU” intensive task, or perhaps this <u>reality</u> was developed by creators that could only get their hands on a low-end simulator.

Using the word “<u>simulation</u>” is also misleading, for that implies it is an artificial rendition of something that already exists.  It is more like a *bona fide* creation, albeit one that may have been designed around a specific model, or for a specific (yet unknown) purpose.

One thing (most) creation theories have in common is how surprisingly compatible they are with the creation <u>myths</u> of the Judeo-Christian, Islam, Hindu, Zoroastrian, Taoist, <u>Buddhist</u> and even Aboriginal Australian, the world’s oldest civilization[^42], where <u>cycles</u> of creations are implicit in all of them, and explicit in many of them.  We would expect to see this similarity between radically different perspectives, such as modern <u>science</u> and ancient <u>religion</u>, if they were all attempting to understand the same thing.

### What Goes Where?

#### **Key 45:** All dualities stem from the first duality.

If the two primal, <u>conceptual</u> and opposing end-points of the spectrum of our <u>reality</u> are *<u>somethingness</u>* and *<u>nothingness</u>*, that leaves a lot of space for pretty much anything to exist.  <u>Entropy</u> tells us that the probability of where stuff will appear will be naturally distributed along the spectrum in what is called a *<u>Bell curve</u>*, or normal distribution of probability curve.  Regardless of the <u>number</u> of variables at play, the probabilities of where stuff will appear will always tend toward this *normal* distribution.

If we had the ultimate <u>Bell curve</u> between the states of <u>nothingness</u> (high <u>entropy</u> <u>chaos</u>) and <u>somethingness</u> (low <u>entropy</u> <u>chaos</u>), the part of the curve that represents the most <u>sustainable</u> condition of these two states would be in the middle.  This will be the point where there is the least amount of disorder and the highest probability for <u>order</u> as each side will be represented in the most <u>balanced</u>, and therefore <u>sustainable</u>, manner.  This chart below is a general <u>concept</u> of the idea.

<center><img src='../Images/021-supercurve1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We see this sort of distribution everywhere in nature.  In fact, in the world of theoretical <u>biology</u>, this is called *<u>environmental dimensionality</u>* and describes how various biological systems coexist.[^43]  The stuff in the middle, between two poles, represents the most effective expression of <u>energy</u> for whatever <u>scope</u> and context applies.

#### **Key 46:** The most likely and persistence state of anything (including <u>ideas</u>) that exists as a result of other states will be where the most <u>balance</u> exists between those other states.

#### **Key 47:** <u>Order</u> emerges most efficiently in a <u>balanced</u> state.

For example, the human eye sensitivity chart below shows that a particular shade of green (555nm) is the most dominant color because this is the middle of the range of our biological sensitivity to light.  This shows that the most efficient (most energetically ordered) function of our eyes is the perception of the color green.  The general prevailing view of why primates, and many other animals, are so sensitive to green is because they evolved in a world that was very green.  The <u>tholonic</u> view is that while that might be a <u>contributing</u> factor, the primary <u>reason</u> is because green is the most efficient of all colors in the visible spectrum, and the visible spectrum is the most efficient form of electromagnetic radiation.  This is the same <u>reason</u> why <u>photosynthesis</u> and chlorophyll tend to make green things. Other life-forms have other ranges of sensitivity depending on their context or environment, so we expect to see minor variations in eye sensitivity, which is not to be confused with eye “machinery”,  such as the eagle’s built-in telephoto lenses due to a deep fovia, or the mantis shrimp’s ability to auto-adjust its eye’s sensitivity to different wavelengths.  Efficiency is contextual. An excellent example of contextual <u>evolution</u> was found in the Movile Caves in Romania.  These caves were sealed off 5,000,000 years ago, yet within the hostile environment, rich in hydrogen sulfide gas and sulfuric acid, at least 33 new <u>species</u> of <u>life</u> have evolved and flourished feeding off the <u>bacteria</u> that eats rocks and other inorganic material (*chemosynthetic <u>bacteria</u>*).

<center><img src='../Images/specrum-eye-curve.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

*Note: in the chart above the maximum <u>frequency</u> listed, 10<sup>30</sup> <u>cycles</u> per second (cps), comes from the fastest gamma ray ever recorded, and was detected on Sept 16, 2008.  It came from a mega-super-nova some 12 billion light years away, which is to say this mega-super-nova happened 12 billion years ago when the <u>Universe</u> was about 1.5 billion years old.  The <u>gamma rays</u> were moving at 99.9999% of the <u>speed of light</u>, suggesting that 10<sup>30</sup> cps is getting close to the upper limit of the maximum end of the spectrum.*

The oscillations between two states, be they the two states of <u>chaos</u>, or <u>order</u> and disorder, <u>movement</u> and stillness, or any two points that are different yet can form an interaction, is the most basic form of energetic expression in all the orders of creation.  This is one area where <u>metaphysics</u>, spirituality, and <u>science</u> all happily converge: everything exists in a <u>duality</u> of some sort, or at least that is how we can describe everything.

Were this <u>duality</u> to no longer exist in a state of imbalance or difference, the <u>cycles</u> of creations would also cease.  How, then, is a stable state of imbalance always maintained? Remember the example of the two water tanks, one higher than the other? Once all the water has moved to the lower tank, and from the lower tank to down the mountain, the water won’t just sit at its final destination doing nothing,  <u>Nature</u> will move that water quite effectively by using another imbalance in another system that causes water to evaporate due to heat, heat that was created by the process of clouds of hydrogen <u>atoms</u> joining together (fusion) to create new elements and <u>transmitting</u> that <u>energy</u> to <u>Earth</u> via oscillating energy.  These evaporated water <u>molecules</u> join together in the sky and eventually fall back to <u>earth</u> and find their way, via <u>entropy</u>, back into the tanks, thereby ensuring the <u>cycle</u> of energy-seeking-balance process remains operating.  Difference must be maintained for <u>energy</u> to <u>work</u>, and <u>nature</u> ensures that a perpetual state of imbalance exists, allowing  for the <u>balancing</u>, the “<u>work</u>”, to take place across all scopes, all the way down (or up) to the first process of imbalance/balancing (which we’ll detail later).

### <u>Waves</u>

<u>Waves</u> are an expression of cycles. When we look at simple <u>waves</u>, such as light <u>waves</u>, radio <u>waves</u>, sound <u>waves</u>, we see an oscillating <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> over time.

On the <u>atomic</u> level, there are electromagnetic <u>waves</u>, such as light, <u>X-rays</u>, radio <u>waves</u>, etc.  On the material level, we have mechanical <u>waves</u>, such as sound waves.  On the organic level and beyond (planets, <u>life</u>, <u>culture</u>, <u>politics</u>, etc.[^44]) we don’t use the term *<u>waves</u>*, instead, we call them *<u>cycles</u>*, but they represent the same thing as <u>waves</u> but in a different context and scope.

<center><img src='../Images/023-sinewave.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

If we look at a typical <u>wave</u> model, which is one <u>cycle</u> of a quantity of <u>energy</u> moving over a period of time, we say that the time it takes to complete one <u>cycle</u> is the <u>frequency</u>, and the distance it covers in one <u>cycle</u> is the wavelength.  <u>Concepts</u> of *<u>frequency</u>* and *<u>wavelength</u>* are typically terms we use to describe <u>waves</u> of <u>radiation</u> and vibration, such as light and sound, but we *could* say the moon has a <u>wavelength</u> of about 50 million km, with a <u>frequency</u> of 0.00599584916 Hz, or that the migration <u>cycle</u> of the <u>Arctic Tern</u>, a bird that flies back and forth between the Arctic and the Antarctic every year, has a <u>frequency</u> of 1/yr., with a <u>wavelength</u> of 70,000 km (which is how far they travel every year).  We don’t because it’s cumbersome, non-intuitive and a fairly useless manner to express such <u>information</u> in our current paradigm.

As meaningless as these terms are for such cases, it does not take away from the idea that these natural <u>cycles</u> are the expressions of the same <u>law</u> that light <u>waves</u> operate under in the transference of <u>energy</u>, but on a different level of expression, on a higher <u>order</u> of <u>complexity</u>, size and dependency where instead of photons we have birds and planets.

Another example might be the interdependent <u>cycles</u> of cohabiting rabbits and coyotes.  It might sound ridiculous to compare <u>X-rays</u> with prey-predator <u>cycles</u>, but both of them share the most basic function, the transference of <u>energy</u> in an attempt to create <u>balance</u>, just in two very different scopes and contexts.

<center><img src='../Images/024-predcycle.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

### Not Just a <u>Cycle</u>

It may be that there is more to <u>waves</u> than just a simple periodic <u>cycle</u>, at least in the way it interacts with its environment.  For example, when we take a <u>wavelength</u> that is the circumference of the world and map it across the equator, we find what seems like an inordinate <u>number</u> of <u>cultural</u> artifacts that represent incredible advances for the time, stretching over 7,000 years.  More then that, there has been a lot of speculation and research[^45] into why the Great Pyramid and <u>Macchupicchu</u>, or the <u>Nazca Lines</u> and <u>Easter Island</u>, fall within this same line (in image below) to within less than one tenth of one degree of latitude.  Some of the other locations, such as <u>Persepolis</u>, <u>Mohenjo Daro</u>, <u>Petra</u>, <u>Ur</u>, and the temples at <u>Angkor Wat</u>, fall within one degree.  It’s almost as if the inhabitants of <u>Earth</u> unconsciously knew something, and what they knew had something to do with a <u>wavelength</u> the size of the <u>planet</u> they lived on, almost as is <u>Earth</u>’s inhabitants were being moved my this <u>wavelength</u> of <u>Earth</u> similar to how sand is moved on a vibrating surface to form patterns.

<center><img src='../Images/world-sine.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The two most common classes of <u>waves</u> are electromagnetic (subatomic particles) and mechanical (particles, M-waves).  If we were to compare them we would see similarities that we could also identify in <u>cycles</u>, such as those mentioned here, but that is beyond the <u>scope</u> of this book as it would be a book itself.  We <u>can at least compare the properties</u> of the two common classes of waves.

<center><img src='../Images/waves.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Yes, for all you physicists and electrical/mechanical engineers that might be reading this with extreme incredulity, the differences between electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical (M) <u>waves</u> are many.  We would expect <u>energy</u> to express its <u>movement</u> quite differently when operating under the <u>laws</u> of <u>subatomic particles</u> than that of matter, but even so, there will be many analogous parallels between the two.

To put their contexts and scopes in perspective, consider that an <u>electron</u> is 100 million times smaller than an <u>atom</u>, and 20 trillion times smaller than a <u>chromosome</u>, let alone the sizes we are talking about for typical M-wave medium, like things you can hold in your hand.  Compare that to the <u>Milky Way</u> galaxy, which is 167,256,410 times the size of our solar system, and <u>Earth</u> is only 1/38000 the size of that.  The difference between an <u>electron</u> and a beach ball is about the same difference between a beach ball and the entire galaxy.  With that in mind, consider that the ratio of the actual <u>Universe</u> compared to the observable <u>Universe</u> is equivalent to an <u>atom</u> compared to the observable universe.  It’s easy to imagine how a fundamental <u>law</u> might be expressed differently at these different scales.

<center><img src='../Images/025-beachball.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

More important than the differences are the similarities, such as the way <u>energy</u> travels through a medium via waves.  All forms of <u>energy</u> are simply a redirection of <u>energy</u> from one state to another, as <u>energy</u> is neither created nor destroyed.  This is the very first <u>law</u> of <u>thermodynamics</u>, the conservation of energy.  We have identified many forms of energy: sound, chemical, radiant, electrical, <u>atomic</u>, mechanical, elastic, ionization, gravitational, dark (that’s the <u>energy</u> causing the <u>Universe</u> to expand faster than we think it should), so is it unreasonable to imagine still more forms of <u>energy</u>? Are emotions like <u>love</u> or <u>fear</u>, desires, thoughts, or even imagination a redirection of <u>energy</u>? And what form does that <u>energy</u> take? Can we say that we know of every type of medium and every type of <u>cycle</u> and the <u>laws</u> that control them? I don’t think so, but we can begin exploring by applying the fundamental <u>laws</u> of <u>energy</u> and cycles.

We can only recognize <u>energy</u> as one form or another, not as pure <u>energy</u> itself.  An everyday example of this is the fact that you can’t see or detect light until the light <u>energy</u> hits something, like a wall or a dust particle or the optical <u>cell</u> in your eye.  The same is true for electricity.  The real mind-bender here is that the dust particle itself is just <u>energy</u> (as is all <u>mass</u> according to *m=E/c<sup>2</sup>*), so we can only see one form of <u>energy</u> when that <u>energy</u> interacts with another form of energy.  As everything is <u>energy</u> interacting with <u>energy</u>, it is easy to understand why we claim that everything that exists (i.e.  has <u>sustainable</u> <u>patterns</u> of <u>energy</u> and interacts with other forms of <u>energy</u>) must oscillate in some sort of medium, and it would be hard to believe we have discovered every form of medium or expression of <u>energy</u> that exists.

#### **Key 48:** We can only see the interactions of <u>energy</u>, and not the <u>energy</u> itself.

What about <u>energy</u> that does not oscillate? Is there such a thing a a 0 Hz <u>frequency</u> <u>energy</u>?  Yes.  It’s called *direct current* (DC) <u>electricity</u> and it is the most common in nature; lightning, static <u>electricity</u>, bio-luminescence, solar particles, etc., but the <u>electrons</u> that transfer that <u>energy</u> do have <u>frequencies</u>, as both <u>waves</u> and particles.

While it is true that DC has no <u>frequency</u> in its transmission, both the <u>energy</u> being transferred and the <u>electrons</u> that are transferring it are certainly traveling in a <u>cycle</u>, for it they were not being returned to the source and recycled, not only would the current end, the circuit would run out of electrons.  While AC is caused by <u>electrons</u> staying in one place and jiggling back and forth 60 times a second (in the U.S.), passing a charge down the wire close to the speed-of-light, the <u>force</u> of DC is always in the same direction, like a river, and while it is passing the current along at the <u>speed of light</u>, the <u>electrons</u> are also being dragged down the wire at about 3 miles per hour, which is the speed that they return to the source, so that <u>cycle</u> is pretty slow, but it is still a cycle.  

The *<u>alternating current</u>* (AC) form of <u>electricity</u>, as we know it, was invented by the Frenchman *Hippolyte Pixii* in 1832, and popularized by Nicola Tesla.  This of AC is quite rare in <u>nature</u>, although AC does exist, technically, as <u>planet</u>’s <u>magnetic</u> <u>fields</u> do flip. e.g, the <u>Earth</u>'s <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u> has reversed 171 times in the last 71 million years, and the Sun’s <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u> flips every 11 years, so that counts, I suppose.  Nevertheless, the <u>reason</u> we use AC is because humanity needed to create a brand new <u>scope</u> and context of <u>energy</u> that was compatible with and usable by <u>humans</u>, and the most efficient system we created was (naturally) one that uses <u>oscillation</u> for transmission.

Theoretically pure <u>energy</u>, which doesn’t exist in the material world, would either have no <u>frequency</u> at all *or* its <u>frequency</u> would be infinite, meaning it would have a <u>wavelength</u> of 0.  In either case, it’s a philosophical question because the result would be the same; <u>energy</u> that never moved in space-time.  In the opposite case of 0 Hz <u>energy</u>, like what we see in <u>nature</u>, its <u>wavelength</u> is infinite, but the <u>energy</u> still moves in a cycle.  Of course, in actual <u>reality</u>, there is not such thing as 0 Hz.

We do not have words for many things as we have yet to recognize them and therefore can’t describe them, measure them or even identify them.  It is not just reasonable to speculate that in the realm of <u>ideas</u> and <u>archetypes</u> there are also <u>cycles</u> and a medium that are completely new to us, it’s quite unreasonable not to, as they, too, are an expression of energy.

This begs the questions “What *is* <u>energy</u>?” Surely the answer to this question would shed light on to the very purpose and meaning of <u>existence</u>, as everything that is, is energy.  Fortunately, the culmination of thousands of years of research and investigation into the greatest mystery of all time has provided an answer, and here it is!:

> <u>Energy</u> is the ability to perform <u>work</u>

What? You were expecting something a bit more&hellip;profound?  This definition is like defining a cat as “*the ability to reduce mouse population*”.  Both definitions are saying what the subject has the ability to do, but says nothing about what it actually is.  There are many kinds of <u>energy</u>, such as <u>kinetic</u>, <u>potential</u>, <u>thermodynamic</u>, metabolic, etc.. We know how to measure it, that it never changes, and that it can’t be created or destroyed.  <u>Energy</u> is like the proverbial duck; we know how it  looks, how it quacks and how it walks, but we have no idea what a ”duck” is.  This is the “What is <u>phlimquitz</u>” problem.  The answer is not:

>  <u>Phlimquitz</u> is the ability to increase suicides by increasing the federal space technology budget.

As far as <u>science</u> is concerned, <u>energy</u> is simply a value that equates to <u>movement</u>, which is fine for the physical sciences, but not for <u>understanding</u> the mechanics of <u>awareness</u>, which is the point of this book (and which we’ll get to very soon).

We can expand on this bit by pointing out that chaotic system do not synchronize with any other system[^375], so, like the Las Vegas of <u>energy</u>, any <u>work</u> performed in a chaotic system stays in that system (for the most part).  Ordered systems synchronize well, so <u>work</u> can easily be efficiently distributed between systems, allowing for a much wider distribution of energy.  This irony that <u>chaos</u> is facilitated by <u>order</u> was mentioned previously, but is worth repeating: 

> Low <u>entropy</u> <u>chaos</u> creates <u>order</u> to better distribute <u>energy</u> which results in high <u>entropy</u> chaos.  

#### **Key 49:** A high state of <u>order</u> distributes more “<u>work</u>”.

### <u>Work</u>

Refining the <u>concept</u> of “<u>work</u>” may seem like an odd segue at this point, but now that it has been brought up, let’s be clear what this means.

In a physical sense, “<u>work</u>” is anything that can be measured in <u>joules</u> (or <u>calories</u>) because “<u>work</u>” is defined as “using <u>force</u> to move something”…period. That something might be <u>atoms</u>, <u>molecules</u>, muscles, bricks, <u>neurons</u>, or literally anything that *can* move, regardless of why such things are being moved. From a <u>physics</u> perspective, building the <u>Taj Mahal</u> and creating the world’s largest garbage landfill are the same when it comes to the <u>work</u> involved if they both burned the same <u>number</u> of calories. The amount of <u>work</u>, in <u>calories</u>, expended in the full time <u>effort</u> for a full year on solving the quantum theory of <u>gravity</u> is equal to 2 cups of tuna salad or the equivalent of <u>jogging</u> less than 2 blocks a day[^339]

The issue is, “<u>work</u>” is measured only in <u>quantitative</u> values, which cares nothing about the <u>qualitative</u> values of that work. This is fine when trying to optimize a steam engine, but not when applied to the real world where quality is just as important as quantity, if not more so. Where <u>humans</u> are concerned, quality requires intention. One must *intend* to create something beautiful, like the <u>Taj Mahal</u>, as it won’t happen by accident.

let’s see if we can translate our <u>concepts</u> of <u>energy</u> into the realms of <u>effort</u> and intentions. For example, we all understand the <u>concept</u> of *<u>resistance</u>* in our daily lives, which is anything that makes whatever we are attempting to do more difficult (usually measured in time, <u>money</u>, or aggravation). *<u>Volts</u>*, or <u>potential</u>, is also easy to equate, as we are (hopefully) aware of the fact that we can probably lift 100 lbs. but not 500 lbs., as doing so will most definitely “short circuit” your back. The same goes for *current*, which is more like stamina. You can’t lift a 500 lb. stone, but you can probably lift one-hundred 5 lb. stones 100 times. It’s not that far a stretch to relate physical <u>work</u> with electrical <u>work</u>, as in both cases the <u>work</u> can be measure in <u>joules</u>, but in the realm of human will, conscious intentions, these definitions get a bit more abstract as we have no idea how to measure such things.

Lets look at the <u>effort</u> it takes to quit <u>smoking</u>, for example. “<u>Effort</u>”, in this context, captures the <u>concept</u> of <u>work</u> as well as <u>intention</u>, but in a totally different context. It takes a lot of <u>effort</u> to quit <u>smoking</u>, but <u>zero</u> <u>calories</u> and <u>zero</u> additional <u>energy</u>, as we normally define that word. With this definition, the technical meaning of <u>entropy</u> is useless, as there is no scientific instrument that can measure <u>intention</u> or will, but the <u>concept</u> is still valid. <u>Entropy</u> in this context of <u>effort</u> is “the amount of <u>effort</u> not available for use”, or simply “lack of <u>effort</u>”.

The main problem is that any measure of <u>work</u> is subjective.  If you ask me which would I prefer to do, dig a trench for 6 hours or listen to a one hour lecture on *Post-modern Fashion in Appalachia*, I'd be digging before you could say “in Berkeley”.  I’d rather expend an additional 10 million <u>joules</u> shoveling dirt than sitting in a lecture hall feeling tortured.  Here, the “path of least <u>resistance</u>” is, by far, the more <u>energy</u> inefficient, but that’s just me.  Someone else would be tickled pink to attend such a lecture (I assume).  However, if <u>energy</u> must always travel the path of least <u>resistance</u>, then one can only presume that the <u>energy</u> <u>I am</u> conserving by not having to listen to that lecture is greater that the <u>energy</u> <u>I am</u> loosing shoveling dirt, but whatever that <u>energy</u> is, <u>science</u> can’t measure, and what <u>science</u> can’t measure, <u>science</u> ignores.  One way it *could* be measured is to ask what the limit of shoveling is before I choose the lecture.  If I draw the line a 6.5 hours of shoveling, then I must feel the lecture will “cost” no more than the psychological equivalent of 10,000,000 <u>joules</u>, whatever that is (psycho-joules? <u>Calories</u> of aggravation?), but even then, that value could change at any moment, for any, or no reason.

Pressure, difference, <u>order</u>, <u>movement</u>, <u>pattern</u>, are low <u>entropy</u> states, or states that require <u>effort</u> to maintain.  To this category, we can now add the more <u>qualitative</u> <u>concepts</u> of moderation, control, command, discipline, and determination.  Dispersion, disorder, stillness are all high <u>entropy</u> states, or states that require little <u>effort</u>, as do the <u>qualitative</u> states of indecision, apathy, doubt, flexibility, irresolution, and weakness.  <u>Microstates</u>, or the <u>number</u> of possible configurations how <u>energy</u> can move between two (or more) states, remains the same in <u>concept</u>, but as it applies to <u>effort</u> and in the context of that effort.  How many ways can the “system” of *you* expend <u>effort</u> towards when you have the <u>intention</u> to address a specific issue?  For example, how many ways can you quit <u>smoking</u>, learn piano, loose weight, kill mosquitoes, write a poem, etc.  

Take one example, such as losing weight, of which there are at least 29 ways to accomplish[^340].  Some people will choose one way, and others will choose other ways.  This is similar to how the <u>quanta</u> use different paths to distribute themselves among bonds.  In North America, the most popular way to lose weight and the way chosen by 60% of dieters (according to Nielsen Global <u>Health</u> & Wellness Survey), is to change their diet away from fatty and processed foods and more towards natural, fresh foods.  We might then surmise that this microstate is the one that represents the <u>balanced</u> exchange of, or application of, effort.  Obviously, a major difference is that <u>humans</u>, and all living things, can select many <u>microstates</u> at once, unlike a <u>quanta</u> that can only select one, but the probability curve will remain the same if we consider a living thing as having many “<u>quanta</u>” of effort. 

In <u>molecules</u>, the exchange of <u>energy</u> is induced by the natural tendency for <u>energy</u> to <u>balance</u> itself between two different states of <u>energy</u>, such as hot and cold.  Here, the two differing states are “what is” and “what is intended”, regardless of whether that <u>intention</u> resulted from necessity or desire.  The <u>intention</u> acts to <u>balance</u> that difference, as in “<u>I am</u> overweight.  I need to lose weight. I will diet”.  But, as we all know too well, <u>intention</u> without <u>effort</u> is useless (and possibly quiet dangerous if there is any <u>truth</u> to the rumor that the road to hell is paved with good intentions).   <u>Energy</u> causes something to change direction or move, and here it is <u>effort</u> that causes *something* to change direction or move.  Whatever the thing is that is being changed, it is acting as <u>resistance</u>, so we’ll just call it that.   

Notice what we have now.  *<u>Resistance</u>* is acting like *<u>mass</u>* that requires *<u>effort</u>* over *time*, or *<u>force</u>*, to change, and the amount if that *<u>force</u>* is determined by one’s *<u>intention</u>*, or what we would refer to as *<u>force</u> of will*, which is another way to say *<u>intention</u>*.   Metaphorically, the <u>concept</u> of *F=m&times;a* is perfectly captured in this one sentence from a speech given to the graduates of the Lenox Academy in Massachusetts, and which coined the phrase “onward and upward”:

> Fail not for sorrow, falter not for sin, but onward, upward, till the goal ye win. **~Frances Anne Kemble, 1809-93**

This phrase makes it quite clear that *<u>intention</u>* to reach one’s goal must be a consistent *<u>force</u>* greater than the *<u>resistance</u>* of sorrow and sin.

Can we then say, if *F=m&times;a*, then *effort&times;time = resistance&times;intention*?  

Let’s test this.  We’ll use the values of ***f***=force, ***e***=effort, ***t***=time, ***r***=resistance, and ***i***=intention.

Imagine these scenarios where both people must quit <u>smoking</u>?

- A life-long smoker has a strong habit (r=10) with a mild <u>intention</u> (i=2) to smoke. *f=i&times;r* &therefore; 2&times;10=20
- A beginning smoker has a mild habit (r=2)  with a strong <u>intention</u> (i=10) to smoke. *f=i&times;r* &therefore; 10&times;2=20

In either case, the *<u>force</u>* of <u>smoking</u> is 20.  To bring the <u>force</u> to 0 either, *<u>intention</u>* must be reduced to 0 as *<u>resistance</u>* is unchangeable.

The strength of the *<u>resistance</u>* is a result of how long, or much *time*, the *<u>effort</u>* to smoke was applied when measured by *<u>intention</u>*, because $r=\frac{e\times t}{i}$ or $r=\frac{f}{i}$.  For example: 

- A lot of <u>effort</u> applied to <u>smoking</u> (e=10) over a long time (t=100) with weak intentions (i=2) to quit, results in a <u>resistance</u> of 500. $(r=\frac{10\times 100}{2}\therefore\ r=\frac{1000}{2}=500)$

- Mild <u>effort</u> applied to <u>smoking</u> (e=2) over a long time (t=100) with weak intentions (i=2) to quit, results in a <u>resistance</u> of 100.  $(r=\frac{2\times 100}{2}\therefore\ r=\frac{200}{2}=100)$

- A lot of <u>effort</u> applied to <u>smoking</u> (e=10) over a short time time (t=10) with weak intentions (i=2) to quit,  results is a <u>resistance</u> of 50. $(r=\frac{10\times 10}{2}\therefore\ r=\frac{100}{2}=50)$

- Mild <u>effort</u> applied to <u>smoking</u> (e=2) over a short time time (t=10) with weak intentions (i=2) to quit,  results in a <u>resistance</u> of 10. $(r=\frac{2\times 10}{2}\therefore\ r=\frac{20}{2}=10)$

You can see that the long-time heavy smoker has the greatest <u>resistance</u> to overcome while the beginning mild smoker’s <u>resistance</u> to quitting is small, but the long-term mild smoker has twice the <u>resistance</u> as the short-term heavy smoker.

The strength of the *<u>intention</u>* is a result of how long, or much *time*, the *<u>effort</u>* to smoke was applied when measured by *<u>resistance</u>*, because $i=\frac{e\times t}{r}$ or $i=\frac{f}{r}$.  For example: 

- A heavy smoker (e=10) who’s been <u>smoking</u> for a long time (t=100) but doesn’t think it’s that big a problem (r=2) has an <u>intention</u> to smoke of 500  $(i=\frac{10\times 100}{2}\therefore\ i=\frac{1000}{2}=500)$.
- A heavy smoker (e=10) who’s been <u>smoking</u> for a long time (t=100) but thinks it’s a problem (r=10) has an <u>intention</u> to smoke of 100.  $(i=\frac{10\times 100}{10}\therefore\ i=\frac{1000}{10}=100)$.
- A heavy smoker (e=10) who’s been <u>smoking</u> for a long time (t=100) but thinks it’s a very big problem (r=100) has an <u>intention</u> to smoke of 10. $(i=\frac{10\times 100}{100}\therefore\ i=\frac{1000}{100}=1)$.

Was this test “successful”? It correctly predicted who would have the hardest time quitting, the effects of <u>effort</u> over time, and even tells us that <u>smoking</u> a little for a longer time creates a bigger problem than <u>smoking</u> a lot over a little time.  While we can’t apply the statistical <u>data</u> of <u>physics</u> to these <u>concepts</u> of <u>effort</u>, <u>force</u>, <u>resistance</u>, and <u>intention</u>, there certainly seems to be a correlation between the <u>laws</u> of <u>physics</u> and these broader interpretations of the physical attributes.  This is what we would expect to see if we were looking at how fundamental <u>patterns</u> of <u>energy</u> apply to different contexts.

If this correlation has any merit, then we can also say that <u>intention</u> equates to <u>voltage</u>, <u>effort</u> equates to <u>amperage</u> or current, and <u>resistance</u> is resistance.  This correlation is poetically poignant when you consider how high-voltage/low-current circuits are more dangerous than low-voltage/high-current circuits.  You wont feel anything if you touch the terminals of 12 <u>volt</u>  5 amp battery, but touch a 220 <u>volt</u> supply with 0.27 amps and you will be shocked, literally and figuratively, even though they both have the same amount of power. Does this suggest that big intentions with little <u>effort</u> are more dangerous that small intentions with lot of <u>effort</u>?  Is this true? Is attempting to start a new business, get married a 2<sup>nd</sup> time, or climb Mount Everest with little <u>effort</u> more dangerous than 100% commitment to <u>balancing</u> your checkbook (not that anyone actually has a checkbook these days), waxing the floor, or buying a new pair of slippers? Foe anyone who has experience with these examples, the answer is obvious.

## Simple <u>Cycles</u>

Let’s look at the simple <u>cycle</u> again as the archetypal <u>pattern</u> that describes the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> through a medium, regardless of the medium.  In some contexts, this <u>pattern</u> is quite measurable, in others, it is analogous, such as in the migration <u>pattern</u> of the Arctic Tern.

When we examine the predator-prey <u>cycles</u>, we can see they follow the same cyclical <u>archetype</u> of light, or <u>electricity</u>, or sound.  Below we show a typical predator pray <u>cycle</u> (taken from a Northern Arizona University <u>biology</u> online-class).  On the left is the <u>data</u> over time, and on the right is the “Phase plan”, or the graph of the relationship between the two variables (coyotes and rabbits).  This is a naturally occurring <u>cycle</u>, but you'll notice that the two <u>cycles</u> naturally occur <IMG src="../Images/math/329.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> a <u>wavelength</u> apart, which is the maximum difference any two <u>waves</u> can have.  We also see this in <u>electricity</u>, where <u>voltage</u> lags current by <IMG src="../Images/math/329.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> <u>wave</u>, or how electric and <u>magnetic</u> <u>fields</u> in a <u>wave</u> are 90&deg; apart. Quite literally, the predator is acting like the *<u>voltage</u>* and prey are acting like *current*.  In the world of <u>electricity</u>, *<u>resistance</u>*=$\frac{voltage}{current}$, R=$\frac{V}{I}$, and *power=voltage&times;amperage* (*P=V&times;I*). Does this mean we can find the equivalent to *<u>resistance</u>* in the predator/prey <u>cycle</u> with $\frac{predator}{prey}$? 

If we look at the <u>numbers</u>, they don’t appear make a lot of sense as $\frac{1000\ coyotes}{10\ rabbits}$=100, or $\frac{10\ coyotes}{1000\ rabbits}$=0.01, which says that the more <u>resistance</u>, the more the coyotes die of starvation, and the less <u>resistance</u>, the more the rabbits die by getting eaten.  However, if we look at it energetically, if the rabbits are being eaten, there is a transfer of <u>energy</u> from <u>rabbit</u> to <u>coyote</u>, and the <u>coyote</u> continues to <u>contribute</u> to the chain “downstream”, so to speak.  If there are no rabbits, the coyotes die of starvation, and while the <u>energy</u> is still transferred back into the <u>earth</u>, the chain’s downstream has been weakened.  In this sense, the value of the *<u>resistance</u>* would represent the *<u>resistance</u>* to the chain’s *<u>sustainability</u>*, as the rabbits are to coyotes what coyotes are to wolves, and what wolves are to mountain lions.  Ultimately, everything ends up back in the ground, which feeds the grass, which the rabbits eat.  In the coyote/rabbit world, a <u>coyote</u> needs about 275 rabbits a year to survive, if all they ate was rabbits.  This would then mean that the baseline *r-value* for a coyote/rabbit *system* is $r=\frac{1}{275}$=0.00363.  Of course, coyotes don’t just eat rabbits, so in practice, *r-values* for all the systems that interact with each other would need to be determined and integrated before these values had any practical meaning.

What about the *power* equivalent with *predator&times;prey* ? Certainly the <u>concept</u> of *power*, which is the rate at which <u>energy</u> is transferred, applies to coyotes eating rabbits, and *current*, which is the amount of <u>energy</u> moving through a system, would apply to the rabbits, at least as far as the coyotes are concerned. With a little imagination and creativity, this ecological <u>cycle</u> could be described as an oscillating circuit using <u>concepts</u> of Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>Law</u> of Motion.

In the image below, the left column shows the *Predator-Prey <u>Cycles</u>*, and beneath that, the <u>cycle</u> of the *system* of coyote/rabbit (combined <u>cycles</u>).  The right column shows the *Parent <u>Archetype</u>* of the *Predator-Pray <u>Cycles</u>*, which is 2 perfect sine <u>waves</u> out pf phase by 90&deg;, which is the same <u>pattern</u> we see in electromagnetic energy.  There is another <u>archetype</u> not shown, and it is the <u>archetype</u> of the <u>archetype</u>, or the *Meta <u>Archetype</u>*.  As it has no context, there are values that apply, so it’s just a flat line, a <u>frequency</u> of 0 Hz, just like <u>nature</u>’s DC current.

In humanity’s quest to understand <u>reality</u> and its processes, either through <u>religion</u>, <u>culture</u>, <u>economics</u>, <u>nature</u>, <u>alchemy</u> or <u>science</u>, we keep bumping into the same universal constants and concepts.
