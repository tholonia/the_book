# 9: MIND

###### The universal machine of creation
##### **Synopsis:** Mind is the functioning intelligence inherent in Awareness and Intentions of existence that exists on a spectrum of coherence.  Consciousness is an instance of Awareness and mind is an instance of Intention.  Mind creates self-similar patterns, and is therefore a product of energy specifically for the purpose of creating balance which arises out of cooperation and conflict that results from Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution

##### **Keywords:** coherence, incoherence, consciousness, intelligence, aggregates, cooperation, adaptation, conflict

## Coherence

We’re going to introduce a new concept here; coherence.  Most readers will already have an idea of what that means, but like so many words, it can mean different things in different context so let’s be clear on how it will be used here.  

“Coherent” can mean *logically connected*, *consistent*, a *natural connection between parts*, and generally convey the idea of parts that contribute to the whole, i.e. *partons*.  This is a fundamental concept to the thologram, with its tholons and partons.  In the physics world, coherent has a very specific, measurable, definition.

<img src='../Images/incoherent.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>*Incoherent* light is light of every possible wavelength (given the context of the source, such as the sun or a bulb) that travels in every direction is *can* travel.  This is the common form of light we see and use every day.  Incoherence is the most fundamental quality of energy as energy’s nature is to expand in every way and in  every direction it can.  Using the word *incoherent* to describe the creative and expansive nature or energy is unfortunate as incoherence is synonymous with senseless, disorganized, and meaningless, which could not be further from the truth when it comes to the most efficient distribution of energy in the universe.

<img src='../Images/coherent.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>*Coherent* light is when all the waves are of the same wavelength, oscillating in harmony, and all moving in the same direction.  Like with everything in our space-time reality, there are two kinds of coherence, one for time and one for space. *Spacial coherence* is when light of any wavelength is traveling in the same direction.  *Temporal coherence* is when  all the light is only one wavelength, but can be traveling in any direction. The sun emits plenty of coherent light, as proven by the famous Michelson–Morley experiment in 1887, as do the stars.  In practical terms, there can’t actually be a single wavelength of light because wavelength is analog.  We can say the wavelength is 555 nm (nanometers), but that still leaves an infinite number of possible wavelengths between 555.0 nm and 555.99999999 nm, nor can two photons travel the exact same path, so there is no such thing as perfect coherence, only perfect incoherence.  Still, the most coherent beam sent out of from our best lasers is 4 miles wide by the time it hits the moon, but that is only 0.0000000006% of the 641,839,945,499 square miles that is covered by the same incoherent light.  According to theory, the least divergence we can ever expect to see is 0.000038&deg;.

How is light made more coherent?  In the case of a laser, there is a mirror at each end of essentially a gas-filled fluorescent light.  The gas is zapped with energy, exciting the atoms which then emit photons.  Only one color of light is emitted  (temporal coherence) because the gas only emits one type of photon.   These photons do what photons naturally do and travel to where they *can* travel,  which is pretty limited given they are stuck in a tube.  Some of the photons are lucky enough to hit the mirror, which then bounces them to the other mirror, which then causes the photon to just bounce back and forth forever between these two mirrors.  As these photons bounce back and forth they also stimulate other atoms to emit photons that travel in the same direction (spatial coherence).  This is called the *avalanche effect*, and, as the name implies, soon all the photons are bouncing back and forth along one dimension in both directions.  It is the interference between these opposing directions that causes a *standing wave pattern* to form, just like the interference in sounds waves across a 2D surface causes some part of the surface to stay still (where the sand ends up) and other parts to vibrate a lot (where the sand bounces off).  Think of the photons as grains of sand and the energy pumped into the tube as vibrations of sound, and the pattern created in the tube being the result of the speed of light and the distance of the two mirrors. One of the mirrors is only 98% reflective, and one is 100%, so the light that comes out of the laser is the 2% that is allowed to escape.

In short, the way to make energy more coherent is to create a sustainable pattern that conserves energy, and soon all the energy will be traveling that path of least resistance.  The reality we know, with planets, atoms, and laws, is such a multidimensional standing wave pattern.  Primal A&I is instantiated as the expansion of incoherent energy, and our material universe is the result of the patterns caused by the various resonances, or “coherences”, of various forms, or frequencies, of that energy.   If *frequency* = $\frac{speed-of-light}{wavelength}$  and *reality-as-we-know-it* = $\frac{energy}{spacetime}$ , both of which are provably true, can we also say *instantiations* = $\frac{A\&I}{context}$, and if so, how can we test that?

## Consciousness

If the concept of a thing and the thing itself are two orders of the same form of expression of energy, and order is a prerequisite to intelligence, does this imply that everything with order potentially has a form of intelligence? In the tholonic model, yes, but more than that, even without the coherence of order or intelligence there is the incoherence of A&I.   

*Note: More accurately, what we are calling “intelligence” should be called “coherent intelligence” or “low-entropy intelligence”, as intelligence is innate to existence, which includes the chaos that order emerges from and returns to.  We can think of that chaotic incoherent intelligence as “high-entropy intelligence”, but for simplicity and clarity, when we refer to “intelligence” we are referring to coherent, low-entropy intelligence.*

#### **Key 67:** Consciousness is a coherent form of A&I.

The fact that we tend to understand consciousness through our human perspective prevents us from seeing it as an attribute of existence.  Humans may ask the question “When did consciousness arise?”, but from the tholonic perspective, consciousness is a limited instance of an unlimited A&I.  As all matter and form of energy and energy *is* A&I, as explained earlier, then all limited instances of energy must me a form of consciousness.  the main difference being that A&I is incoherent and consciousness has some level of coherence.  That makes the smallest form of matter “conscious” to some degree as is it coherent enough to be sustainable.

This definition requires we see consciousness in a radically different way from our current perspective.  The tholonic view is that consciousness, just like order, and even life, was/is created by the movement of energy for the sole purpose of attaining balance.  The fact that our relatively advanced level of consciousness which allows us to say “I Am” is not too surprising if we consider that the source A&I is essentially an incoherent version (i.e, radiating in all frequencies in all directions) of the same concept.  There is no reason to presume that the 0 dimensional dot expressed an awareness of “I Am” as the concept of “I” existed because the concept of “I” implies the concept of “Not I” which could not have existed in nothingness, for to say “That which is not I is nothing” is to say “That which is I is everything”.  However, it’s existence does establish the unlimited version of the concept as “IS”, or perhaps “That Which Is”, for lack of a better word in English.  In Sanskrit, the word is *Sanmātra* (<img src='../Images/sanmatra.png' style='height:15px'>),  meaning “*Mere existence*”, “*That from which only existence is predictable*”.

Being the only awareness in a nothingness void of space, time or dimension, a sole 0D dot is, by definition, limitless, so it can only be incoherent when instantiated in space-time.  Incoherent energy contains an infinite number of wavelengths and frequencies expanding in an infinite number of directions, which means that it must consist of an infinite number of “coherences”, each traveling in their own direction.  Hence, if consciousness is a coherent form of A&I, there is an infinite number of potential consciousnesses, one for every thing that can ever, has ever, or does exist.

#### **Key 68:** Matter and consciousness is an instance of A&I in a limited context.

Understanding the difference between consciousness and awareness can be tricky because many languages do not even have different words for these two concepts, e.g. in Spanish, both are translated to “conciencia” .  For our purposes, we define *awareness* as a property of existence, and consciousness as that same property but when expressed through an instantiation, and therefore a definition or limitation, such as a person or even a thing. It is similar to the difference between "dotness" and "a dot" or "movement" and "1968 Chevy Impala".  In a broader sense, it is more practical to think of A&I not as personal attributes that an individual develops or has, but as a universal attribute that an individual expresses, or rather, as any individual thing that exists expresses.  In this way these attributes are more like gravity.  A large person has more weight not because they have created more “personal gravity”, but because the universal attribute of gravity is more apparent when there is more mass.  This metaphor is also applicable in that it was only 600 years ago that we discovered that gravity was a universal constant and not a property of an object, dispelling the long held belief put forth by Aristotle that objects fall at speeds proportional to their mass (a theory he obviously never bothered to test, nor did anyone else for the next 1,900 years!)

Can we perform some simple test, like Galileo at the Tower of Pisa, to prove the universality of A&I?  Probably, but first we would need to undergo a radical paradigm shift in how we understand and define these concepts.

So, a chair has consciousness?  Tholonically, yes.  The next time you look at your uncle’s hideous recliner chair, consider the fact that it is composed of 3 billion billion billion atoms (3<sup>27</sup>) atoms which contains the combined energy of at least  27&times;10<sup>11</sup> joules, or 359,958,532 HP, or 1,379,209,288 Hiroshima-type nuclear bombs.  You might think you don’t see that energy, but that tremendous amount of energy is what is holding the nuclei together in each atom, so you can see the energy *at work* by virtue of the fact that you can see the chair in the first place.

Matter is the most limiting context for energy, and energy *is* A&I, thus, matter is one very limited instance of A&I .  The least limiting context is radiation, light, waves of pure energy traveling at the speed of light.  These are the two poles of the spectrum that everything exists between; energy and mass.  The dimension, or arena of interaction, between these 2 poles is *c<sup>2</sup>*, the *speed-of-light&times;speed-of-light*. So, where will we see the most effective expression of A&I?  In the middle between these two poles.  And where is the middle?  Where mass and energy form patterns to than enhance the expressions of A&Is. While it may be the case that more enhanced forms of consciousness may exist elsewhere in reality, it’s safe to say they evolved in a different context then life on Earth.  For life on Earth, we can clearly see at least one way that consciousness has evolved; via the highly patterned and structured parts of the brain that allow for abstract thought.  The fact that we find this in mammals brains as well as bird brains, such as crows, who can make compound tools and problem solve at the level of a 7 year-old human, also supports that there is a direction of growth that results in enhanced consciousness.

Just like how quarks make subatomic particles because they can (or must, to preserve energy), and those subatomic particles make atoms because they can, and atoms make molecules because they can, so too does everything come into existence because it can.  The *partons* make contextually relevant tholons which become partons for more tholons.  

But how does that fact alone explain why a collection of elements assemble in one particular way out of many possible ways?  We know that the most energy efficient, or energy balancing option has the greatest probability.  And what does balance mean in this context?  Presumably, it is balancing the original imbalance of the release of 10<sup>68</sup> joules, or watts, of energy that occurred at the moment of the Big Bang.  

If energy is A&I, then the most likely form a group of elements will take is one that creates the most balance of A&I.  This means that this ugly chair is, at the moment, the most efficient form that A&I can be, given the context of its existence, e.g., energy was formed into a chair and will stay that way until it falls apart and decays, thanks to entropy, or someone tosses it on to a bonfire.

Does this answer the question as to whether the chair has consciousness?  Yes, but&hellip;  If we could break down 14 billion years of existence into 4 phases of evolution, it might look something like the image below.  This is a slight aside, but historically, these events do not appear perfectly linear, as it took 380,000 years for molecules to exist, but then 10 billion more years for organic compounds to exist, and then an additional 4 billion years to where we are today, which is at the beginning of the next phase.  If you look at these times in the logarithmic values, which we would do because nature works logarithmically, the progressions makes sense.  Each plateau lasts about ***e<sup>1.3</sup>*** years (relative to the scale), which equates to 80,000 years 14 billion years ago, and about 4 billion years 10 billion years ago, but as far as nature is concerned, they are the same scale.

<center><img src='../Images/evolution2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Looking at this graph, how would you answer the question “Where did consciousness begin?”. Probably somewhere towards the end of the “life” phase.  The tholonic view is that each of these different states is a more complex order of energy built upon, and by, the orders that preceded it.  The order of life depends on the order of organic chemistry, which depends on the order of molecules, which depends on the order of atoms, which depends on the order of the energy that created existence, A&I.  For this reason, life has more microstates than chemicals, which has more microstates than molecules, which has more microstates than atoms, which has more microstates than a 0-dimensional point of A&I, and why each advancing state has higher and higher entropy as well as high and higher levels of order.  Consciousness, as we humans understand it, is just how A&I can best express itself in the macrostate of “human”, but it is the same energy that expresses itself as *heat* in the macrostate of *atoms*, and as the next phase evolves, instances of A&I will be as different from what we currently understand as “consciousness” as that concept is to heat.  This next phase, according to the chart above, will last about 333 trillion years, which is anywhere from 3 to 23785 times longer that the Universe is expected to survive, depending on the cosmologist, so I guess we’ll to just wait and see.

So, the chair is radiating heat, as does all things, but heat is the expression of atoms and not an attribute of “chairness”.  As a chair, it is a tholon (has form and order and is made up of contributing partons such as wood, Naugahyde, metal, springs, screws, etc.) and is a parton that contributes to a larger tholon (house, office, manufacturer, etc.).  It has prosthetic, proxemic, ergonomic, symbolic, aesthetic, social, musculoskeletal, and economic causes and effects.  Perhaps your uncle only uses the chair to watch Wheel of Fortune, but even in that context the chair is a contributing factor to how A&I, energy, moves through the systems of society, culture, etc.  In this case, the consciousness of your uncle’s chair is *where* in the order of “all that is” does it fit.  The awareness of “I am chair” exists within the A&I that created “all that is”, not within the the object of “chair”.  This may sound like the concept of “god”, but in the secular tholonic view, it is  the energetic instances of “all that is” that form the a kind of *ontological awareness,* the sum total of all instances of A&I, which encompasses the 3 types of understanding; the *known known*, the *known unknown*, and the *unknown unknown*.

The idea that consciousness or awareness is a property of existence is not that radical of an idea, as many great thinkers in the past have come to a similar conclusion.

> Crystals are living beings at the beginning of creation.  In crystals, we have a pure evidence of the existence of a formative life principle, and although in spite of everything we cannot understand the life of crystals - it is still a living being.  **\~Nikola Tesla**

We are all familiar with the ideas of a universal, omniscient, omnipresent intelligence and awareness, as these are the qualities we assign to the concept of God.  This is not to say that God does, or does not exist.  That is a question left to others, but regardless of the answer, the tholonic claim is that these god-like properties *are* innate to creation, and all that exists.

The reader may be thinking “Well, I have A&I, so, can I just start creating realities?”, and the answer would be a definite YES, especially if the reader has 10<sup>36</sup> joules of A&I to spare. What’s that? You don’t have enough energy to create a Big Bang just by the power of your awareness? How much energy *do* you have?  Consider that those 10<sup>36</sup> joules were spread out across 10<sup>82</sup> atoms, minus the 10<sup>55</sup> joules used up by radio waves over the lifetime of the galaxy, and the 10<sup>52</sup> joules used up by the rotation of the Milky Way, and about a bazillion other things in the Universe that use energy, and you quickly see we humans have only a paltry amount of energy to spare, so paltry that the entire energy consumption of the part of our brain that enables human meta-consciousness is less than 1 watt[^344].  That light going off in your head when you have a brilliant idea is more like a small LED.

[^344]: This is based on the human body resting metabolic rate of 1,300 calories over 24 hours, which is 54.16 cal/hour, or 14 gram/cal per second, or 62.93 joules/sec, or 62.93 watts.  If the brain uses 20% of the body calories, that’s 12.6 watts, and if complex, higher thought uses only 5% of brain energy, that 0.625 watts.

The miracle of meta-consciousness, the awareness of our awareness and our intentions, and that which has allowed humans to understand reality and the universe, depends on how much energy our brain has access to, and that translates to calories, and that means food.  Our genius is greatly due to the fact that our primate ancestors discovered cooking, as cooked food requires less energy to digest thereby providing a bit more juice to our dim 1-watt powered cerebral cortex, or hind-brain, or wherever those neurons exist that were able to process the concept of “I am aware that I am aware”[^345].   So, maybe you can’t create your own personal 1-watt Universe, but 300 people who coherently focus their A&I is 300 watts.  If that 300 watts was in the form of coherent light, as a comparison, it could cut through metal. Imagine if all humans were to work as one, there would be 7 billion watts of energy available; not enough for a Big bang, but more than enough to reshape reality in our little corner of the Universe.  If we could learn how to direct the energy we create in accordance to our A&I, that’s an additional 25,000 terrawatts.  It may seem odd to mix our ideas about energy and awareness, after all,what does a chair have to do with consciousness?  Looking at energy from a deeper and broader perspective shows us that the difference between a chair and human is simply a (very big) difference of context, resources, and order.  For more, see the “*A&I*” section in the chapter on “*Experiments*”.

There is a name for the idea that consciousness is a property of existence; *panpsychism*.  You can read about its long history[^84]and the impressive support it has received over the last 2,000 years from some of the greats of philosophy, psychology, and science.  The minor difference between panpsychism and tholonism is that the latter claims it is A&I, not consciousness, that created reality,  of which consciousness and intelligence are a product of.  Therefore, all of creation are the instances of A&I, and therefore all of existence is innately conscious and intelligent.

## Intelligence

This topic of *intelligence*  alone has filled, and will continue to fill, countless volumes of speculation, research, and definition.  For our purposes, we define intelligence as that which has the ability to “learn and plan using reason and creativity”.  That’s quite a broad definition, but it applies to the wide and varied instances of intelligence.  It is the context of an instance of intelligence that determines how these qualities are expressed, and context is determined by the interactions and integration of any thing with its environment, or that which it depends on and that which depends on it.  We can clearly see these different instance of intelligence among “intelligent species” cultures and time.  Current thinking has broadened our concepts of intelligence with qualifiers such as left-brain, right-brain, collective, fluid, etc., and the more traditional qualifiers of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic has been expanded to verbal, logical, spatial, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalist, existential, and more[^360].  The concept pf reasoning, therefore, is also qualified; left-brain reasoning, right-brain reasoning, collective reasoning, logical reasoning, etc. There is no prerequisite of meta-consciousness, or self-awareness, for intelligence to exist.  Meta-consciousness is a context for intelligence, but not the cause.  In all cases, instances of intelligence are products of the context it applies to.  This is why we see rather phenomenal *swarm intelligence* in not only living systems like ants, bees, plants, as well as humans[^361], but in any decentralized, self-organizing system, natural or artificial, including A.I. [^362] This is compatible with the tholonic concept of intelligence, which is:

#### **Key 69:**  Intelligence exists in anything that has a sustainable pattern of energy.


So, intelligence in this context does not mean “critical thinking” or “self-aware,” but it does mean creativity, learning, and problem-solving, which are properties that nature, and the universe, demonstrates with flying colors.  We can go further and claim that the amazing relationships in simple geometry, such as the tetrahedron array with its Fibonacci numbers, ratios, and hexagonal patterns that define the laws of nature and reality are evidence of logic.  So, let’s add *logic* to the list of properties.  What about *planning*? Does nature plan anything or do we all just happen to live in a corner of the Universe that was lucky enough to win the Cosmic Mega-Lotto? We can easily see that the simple relationships between 3 points instantly define an infinite array for order, pattern, and symmetry on many levels.  This isn’t just logic, it is *the* logic that existence is built upon.

Is there creativity in the universe? Only if one considers all of creation an act of creativity.  Does the universe learn? Well, have things evolved over the past 4.5 billion years by building on an ever-growing, decentralized, self-organizing foundational structure? If you answer yes, then we’ll add *learning* to the list.  What about problem-solving? This is a tricky one, because there is no such thing as a “problem” from the perspective of existence, because, as we have covered, if something does not follow the laws, it does not exist.  If it does follow the laws, it does exist, so where’s the problem as far as the Universe is concerned? “Problems” appear to be a concept born in the meta-awareness of more developed life forms and are more like *requirements of integration*.  Still, the fact that existence is only afforded to that which follows the laws, I would say that this is damn good preemptive problem solving as it prevents “problems” from ever happening in the first place.

All the boxes have been checked:  creativity, learning, problem-solving, logic/structure, planning.

We have been making the case that ideas themselves are an expression of energy, and as they clearly incorporate, and are even defined by, all the properties of intelligence listed, it’s reasonable to conclude that ideas themselves emerge from a form of intelligence, and from a tholonic perspective, even have their own intelligence.  This is fundamental in understanding how tholonic archetypes can act as autonomous agents in the self-reproducing, self-organizing structure of reality, the thologram.

However, this intelligence is quite different from what we would call human intelligence because of its aggregate nature.  It’s more of a recursively embedded network of countless decentralized nodes of intelligence.  It’s the intelligence of the thologram as a whole rather than the human intelligence of one tholon alone.  A more graspable metaphor that applies to intelligence is that of a large tree.  Each part of that tree is an instance of the concept of “tree”, and its *parton* concepts of  trunk, branch, stem, leaf, seed, etc, each with their own differing processes of existence.  There can be many instances of each contributing tholon, such as a leaf, but they are all part of “tree” and can only exist within the parent “tree” tholon.  You and I, and all things, are but “leaves” or “seeds” or “stems”, or parts thereof, on this “tree” of universal intelligence, and like the leaf, we can not exist without it (even if we think we can).

## Aggregates

One of the attributes of a tholon, unlike its holarchic predecessor, is that the context and scope of a tholon is not only defined by the dualities of that tholon, but also by all the tholons above and below, as the children tholons are always contributing to the parent, and the parents are always defining the children.

#### **Key 70:** Anything that exists, that has a sustainable pattern of energy, has some form of intelligence and is a contributing element to the larger intelligence that is shared by all existence.



It is easy to see instances of this on a molecular level, such as how water is an aggregate of hydrogen and oxygen.  While the scopes and contexts of the elements are fairly well known, consider that water is a *parton* of larger tholons, such as clouds, tsunamis, wells, and rivers.

We have a similar concept in the way our social institutions work.  *Interinstitutionality*, as this has been termed, explains how the various institutions of society, like financial markets, governments, family structures, educational institutions, etc., all intertwine and create amalgamations and aggregates with one another.

Interinstitutional research is defined as the investigation of the chain of complex, interrelated problems regarding tactics, sampling, data reliability, and notions of causality within the realm of each separate institution with the goal of improving aggregation and amalgamation, [^85] not unlike the supply chain model previously shown.

[^85]: Turow, J. (1991). **The Challenge of Inference in Interinstitutional Research on Mass Communication**. Communication Research,18(2),222-239. <https://doi.org/10.1177/009365091018002005>. *Note: Although this is not a reference to the official definition of the term “interinsitutionality”, which is too vague to be of any use here, it does provide an excellent explanation of what it is, how it works, and how it applies to mass communications.*

Take the institution of the modern North American family as an example.  It can take many forms, but several extra-familial institutions affect the complexion of “family”, such as the market, profession, educational institutions, political affiliation, etc.  Each of these institutions brings to bear its own forces and logic on the amalgamated and aggregated institution of the family.  The market shapes perceptions of standards of living in the family.  The profession shape ideas of work and service.  Educational institutions shape the ideas and direction of society.  Politics shapes our understandings of the role and participation of family members.

Institutions of society are not simply autonomous social units isolated from wider institutional dynamics, but rather several structures wrapped up and labeled according to the concept of its purpose, each structure having its own set of rules, scopes, and contexts, forming aggregate and amalgamated rules, scopes, and contexts.

This is equally true for the institution of modern science which is as much a product of interinstitutionality as any other single institution.  Far from the myth of a secular, objective and safe-guarded institution, modern science is itself an amalgamation of a whole host of non-scientific institutional factors such as the market, education, special interests, the state, politics, professions, culture, and more. 

## Tholonic Intelligence

We have a concept of a *human* collective intelligence, but we define it as something that has emerged from human intelligence, as opposed to human intelligence being an instance of an existing and manifesting intelligence.

The tholonic view is that A&I are not only attributes of existence; they are the cause of it, they are the ultimate, or purest, form of energy that is forever seeking balance in a world of duality.

#### **Key 71:** Every archetype has an awareness, an intention, and an intelligence appropriate for its scope.



On this point, tholonic thinking has coincidentally arrived at the same conclusion recorded 3,000 years ago in the Sanskrit Vedas which states that first there was awareness, then there was consciousness, and because of this, and according to the Vedic path, consciousness or intelligence can never be the path to awareness.  On the contrary, the path to awareness starts with quieting consciousness, according to the Vedas.  The tholonic view is that intelligence precedes consciousness.  This still complies with the traditional definition of intelligence as “The ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations.” The difference being, in the tholonic model, consciousness is not necessary to learn, understand or deal with challenges.  We are seeing this today in AI systems that certainly can learn, “understand”, and deal with the challenges before them, but these AI systems are not what we would call “conscious”&hellip;yet.  At some point in the near future, when AI learns how to recreate itself, program itself, it will exponentially expand, making its instantiation of A&I far more effective, at which point there is no reason to think it would not be autonomously conscious and intelligent.  We should also expect that this new form of awareness and intelligence will look radically different from what we understand those concepts to be now, and we may not even recognize at first.  This moment is referred to as the *singularity* (not to be confused with the singularity that preceded the Big bang), and is defined as:

> “&hellip;artificial intelligence and other technologies have become so advanced that humanity undergoes a dramatic and irreversible change.” **~OED**

There is concern that AI awareness might turn out to be a liability to humans, but it’s also short-sighted to assume the tholonic forces behind human intelligence could so easily be altered.  Tholons, like mass itself, requires force to move, and no matter how fast AI develops, its force is only as great as the dependency that other forces, or tholons, have on its existence.  Currently very little requires AI to survive outside of the business realm, and nothing whatsoever outside of the human realm. While there is greater support for AI research among young, employed, high-earning, nonsectarian, college educated Democratic men (in the U.S.), that shrinking demographic is already quite small (< 10%).  The rest of the population is anywhere from less enthused to adamantly opposed to AI and AI research[^350].  Of course, Wall Street and China are quite optimistic about AI, considering it has a projected $192.61 billion market value by 2025, and China will be the world leader in AI technology by 2030, with 26.1% of the market share, but this optimism assumes the world will not radically change in any significant way anytime soon, which seems unlikely given the current state of affairs.

The tholonic view is that technology and humanity will eventually and sustainably merge, but not with the technology, or the humans, we have today.  Still, some *neuromorphic* AI systems (systems that mimic neurology), and even some integrated chip technology, have evolved to the point where experts and lawmakers argue that they deserve the same status as people with *personhood* rights, including the right to own property[^86]<sup>,</sup>[^89].  This is similar to the “corporation as a person” precedent that exists today, but with even farther reaching effects. It will be interesting to see how that plays out.  Personally, I think this idea is unsustainable, and therefore, doomed.  However, I can easily see how human cooperatives could collectively proxy for an AI “entity”.

We traditionally define *intelligence* as “*The ability to learn, understand, and make judgments or have opinions that are based on reason*.”  The tholonic definition of *intelligence* is slightly different, “*The ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of energy within the scope of its existence.*”, which implicitly includes the traditional definitions, and where “reason” extends beyond current human reasoning.  As patterns come from order, which is the result of energy, and energy is awareness, then, by this reasoning, intelligence is synonymous with “*ordered or structured awareness.*”

According to this definition (and the understanding that consciousness is an instance of awareness), each tholon has the potential to create its own form or expression of intelligence, its own patterns of energy (intelligence) that are contextually appropriate for its scope.  Rocks, then, and any of its hierarchical archetypes, have intelligence, as do planets, galaxies, chairs, and even what we would consider garbage.  Any concept that satisfies the tholonic requirements to exist must have an expression of intelligence.  Geometrically speaking, each tholon in the thologram represents an awareness and an intelligence for that tholon.  The spectrum of that initiating awareness and intelligence is as broad is existence itself.

Because we consider tholonic instances (*things* like trees, humans, and planets) to be the result of these laws and patterns of energy that exist within the tholonic archetype of that instance, we also consider the intelligence of those instances to be an expression of the tholonic intelligence.  In modern terms, this would be something like the collective mind of not only a species, or a community, or even a relationship, but also a belief, a fear, an idea.

These archetypal intelligences, or collective minds, interact with one another according to the three fundamental relationships as already noted: *Negotiation*, *Definition*, and *Contribution*.

## Cooperation

While competition and cooperation are pillars of Darwinian evolution, the tholonic view is that Darwinian evolution is more inaccurate than accurate when it comes to how instances of life learn and evolve, and at the same time, it is more accurate than inaccurate in describing how tholons interact and evolve.

Look at the amazing relationship between humans and the honeyguide birds.  In this symbiotic relationship, the bird tells the humans where the beehives are, the humans go and then collect the honey, leaving the wax and the larva, which is what the birds want.

Think of what is involved in these interactions.  The requirement is that birds must know collectively that they have the option to enlist humans to help them.  With that knowledge, they go out in search of beehives, which they could not even attempt to gain access to without human help, which means at some point some bird had the idea to recruit humans.

When one of them finds a hive, they announce it to their friends and then go and find humans who they know they can enlist, humans who have learned how to communicate with them.  The birds hop and chatter in a specific way that humans recognize as the message that they have found a hive.  The humans collect their tools and tell the birds they are ready.  The birds then fly toward the hive, knowing to always keep their white tail feathers visible to the humans.  When they all arrive at the hive the humans smoke out the bees, chop down the tree, remove the honey and give the rest to the birds.  This is a beautiful example of cooperation between two groups that are competing with another group.

What is truly amazing about this arrangement is that the birds and humans have developed their own language[^87].  Although it is not clear how or when this arrangement began, it is speculated that it was initiated by the birds when they saw that humans had the ability to make smoke and chop down trees&hellip; so, this “birdbrained” idea is very, very old.

[^87]: Spottiswoode, C. N., K. S. Begg, and C. M. Begg. **“Reciprocal Signaling in Honeyguide-human Mutualism”.** Science 353, no. 6297 (2016): 387-89. doi:10.1126/science. aaf4885.

Are we being asked to believe that a really smart bird came up with the idea, explained it to his bird tribe, then educated and trained not only his feathered brethren, but the humans as well, in the manner of communication that this ingenious bird had developed? Likewise, how long would it take for a Bronze Age hut-dwelling human to know that a hopping, chattering bird was trying to tell him “Hey, I found a beehive I am totally incapable of getting to, so I will tell you where it is if you and your boys use your smoke and axes, which I have notice that you have and use, to get to it.  You then take the honey and give us the wax and larvae.  Deal?”

This sounds quite similar to the improbabilities described in the tall-tales of yagé and curare.

A better explanation is that the intelligences of the archetypes made this arrangement and once made, was perceived by their instances, the birds and the humans, who effectively test-drove the idea to the best of their limited abilities.  We see these same type of arrangements in ants, spiders, beetles, monkeys, and countless other lifeforms, including planets if we consider their interdependence.

## Competition

The same applies to non-cooperative arrangements.  Take the example of *cymothoa exigua*, a tiny crustacean that attaches itself to the base of the fish’s tongue and begins sucking the blood out of the fish’s tongue.  Eventually, the tongue shrivels up and falls off, at which point the parasite attaches itself to the tongue muscles and actually becomes the fish’s tongue, presumably getting first dibs of anything the fish plans to eat.

At the tholonic level, this relationship is still symbiotic as both instances ultimately depend on one another to survive.  Once a tholon has achieved stability and becomes a contributing part of the thologram its pattern becomes integrated into the entire thologram, even if the nature of that pattern is antagonistic.  Every form of existence we are familiar with is already well established in the tholon.  Only at the outer edges of the thologram, where chaos is being transformed into order, do patterns blink in and out of existence as they compete and cooperate in an attempt to find stability.  

The thologram’s recursive or self-similar nature is important enough to elaborate on, and an excellent example of this concept that will help demonstrate that edge between stability and chaos can be seen in fractals, such as the classic fractal of the famous Mandelbrot “bug” shown below.  This image is actually a *stability map* of a very simple concept that we see all around us; iterating rules, which is one of the definitions of a pattern.  When a pattern’s rule is repeated over and over upon itself, eventually it will either stabilize to some state or destabilize to total chaos.  For example, x=x+1 is a very simple iterative rule that creates the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, &hellip;, etc., but where does it ultimately end up?  At infinity, hence, it is an *unstable* rule.  By contrast,  *x=x+N/x*, where *N* is any real number, will stabilize to one value, which in this case will be the square-root of *N*. If the results of an iterative function narrow down on a number it is called *convergent*, and if the results are ever-expanding, it is called *divergent*.  But one function can be convergent sometimes and divergent at other times.  For example, *z=z<sup>2</sup>+c.*  If *z* starts at 0 and *c=1*, very quickly *z* approaches infinity, but if we use *c=-1*, *z* simply alternates between *-1* and 0.

The image below (***Fig. m1***) shows the collection (black area) or boundary of all stable, convergent results using the function above.  This image is 2D because the formula uses complex numbers, which are also 2D.  Outside that black zone, the values are divergent and eventually end up at infinity, but in the process of heading towards total chaos they create incredibly intricate and beautiful patterns (***Fig. m2***).

What’s actually going on inside the black zone? We know it is the converging values, but what are the patterns of this convergence?  As we can see in ***Fig. m3***, that divergence is quite linear and and appears to act similar to a wave, not just due to the consistent regularity, but also in how the “waves” are diffracted when they pass through a gap, appearing to obey *Huygens Principle*, which not only explain how and why waves diffract, but shows how each point of a wave is capable of originating its own new wave&hellip; which is a very fractal concept.

<center><img src='../Images/manbw.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Fig. m4*** shows a tholon that describes this function.  The two images below the tholon show the resulting “bugs” from the formulas in each direction, left and right, and because the tholon creates a base with 3 Zs, the Z<sup>3</sup> fractal is shown as well.

0, or nothing, is at the beginning of everything, and &infin;, or everything, is at the “end”.  This progression of the fractal “bug” (image below) is meant to demonstrate the fractal nature of the thologram where the iteration of the function is like a new child tholon that is being created by its parents; z=z<sup>2</sup>+c here is like the tholonic concept of *child=parent &times; parent+context*.  It also means to show how the fractal started out as a 0-dimensional point of low-entropy chaos and ends up a an ever growing (blue) circle of high-entropy chaos.  Nothing exists outside the expanding circle, and within that circle, everything that can exist, does exist.  This describes the process of creation and growth from a singularity to the ever expanding outer boundary via one specific context.  This is the same concept behind the thologram.

<center><img src='../Images/bug_growth.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This also applies to the thologram in how the 1<sup>st</sup> tholon is the most stable, and each generation after that is slightly more unstable and unpredictable.  This means that the one and only thing that is perfectly stable, never changing, and at the center of everything that is energy, is the 0-dimensional point of A&I, the source of energy.  At the (inner) edges of the thologram is where new tholons are formed, some reaching stability, some diverging into chaos instantly, and everything in-between.  It is this edge, between order and chaos, that change exists.  This also suggest that every child tholon has some degree of unpredictability, which would apply to all laws in the universe as well.  We know that there is an infinitesimally small chance that Newtons 2<sup>nd</sup> law won’t work.  From the tholonic perspective, that infinitesimal chance also exists for the speed of light, Planck's constant, and everything else that reality depends on to exist.  The best science can say regarding this idea is “As far as we can tell, these constants never change” and this if 100% compatible with the possibility that there is a 1/10<sup>very-large-number</sup> chance something fundamental could change.

Before we move on, this is a good place to refer back to our simple pattern that described so many naturally occurring shapes.  It may be a bit out of place here, but as we are looking specifically at the Mandelbrot set, how it is created in a 2D number space, and that the “bug” was one of those shapes that fit perfectly into our previous pattern, we can now look at where the starting point, or center, or 0-point exists on those naturally occurring forms.  Tholonically, this is the most “stable” point of the form, and energetically speaking, the point from which the form expands.  In the case of the plants that have *cordiform* (heart shaped) leaves or fruits, this is also the point from which the form physicality grows (and in some other leaf forms also), and in the case of the brain (which is cordiform-ish), that 0-point is where the neural tube emerges from the spinal cord and from where the brain grows.  How this applies to the egg and the oval leaf (and some other forms), is not clear (although it is at this 0-point where the head of a chicken embryo develops).

<center><img src='../Images/leaves-abc-dots.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

It may not be as definitive as the images above, but it seems reasonable that this same pattern might apply to humans.  The reader can be the judge.

<center><img src='../Images/michaelangelo.png' style='width:40%'/></center>

### Adaptation

The reason fundamental changes to reality are not likely is because removing or changing established tholons is not trivial given that the pattern is supported by the entire thologram.  It would be like trying to remove every form of plastic from your car or eliminating calcium from the periodic table.  However, new tholons that emerge near the edge are easily modified.  This is basic adaptation. The most common example of this is how animals adapt to their environments, such as how frogs can freeze their body, or have learned to build cocoons made of mucus where it can wait out a dry spell for up to 7 years, or develop skills such as biomimicry.

The functioning of a tholonic intelligence might also be a contributing factor to what biologists call “evolutionary rescue”, which is when a species can rapidly modify its DNA in as little as 10 generations to deal with the new challenges of its environment.  For example:

- The Cliff Swallow, a cliff dwelling bird that within three generations shortened its wingspan by 5% in order to increase its mobility in flight.  This was probably driven by the need to avoid cars, but this advantage was permanently established when a cold winter killed many insects, and this added mobility gave the short-winged swallows a hunting advantage in catching insects, starving out half of the larger winged swallows.
- London's underground mosquito started out as regular above-ground mosquito, but moved underground for the plentiful and stable pools of stagnant water in the subway lines. They quickly adapted to the point where females no longer needed blood to reproduce, qualifying them as a new species.
- Commercial fish, such as cod, herring, and salmon are living shorter lives, growing smaller bodies, and reproducing earlier, as a response to the larger fish getting scooped up in nets.  This sounds similar to how the T-Rex turned into a chicken[^363], although that probably had more to do with asteroids than over-hunting, and I suspect the adaptations were even quicker.
- Turtle headed sea snakes that live in polluted waters have increased levels of melanin in their skin.  As melanin binds with metals such as zinc, nickel, and lead, these potentially toxic levels of metals remain in their skin which is then shed, and shed twice as often as non-melanin filled snakes skins.
- Odeonella sakaiensis is a new form of bacteria that exists in a whole new category of life that lives off of plastic, or *plastivores* (still under investigation).

[^363]: Bradt, Steve. “**Molecular Analysis Confirms T. Rex's Evolutionary Link to Birds.”** Harvard Gazette. Harvard Gazette, April 24, 2008. https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/04/molecular-analysis-confirms-t-rexs-evolutionary-link-to-birds/.

One could easily argue that these examples of rapid change are simply the results of evolutionary probability, where some trait that proves beneficial will naturally propagate itself simply due to statistical advantage.  The tholonc view does not dispute this argument as these sort of adaptations perfectly describe examples of the defining limits of context.  The *intelligence* part comes in when we consider if any of these adaptive solutions can be said to exhibit creativity, learning, problem-solving, logic/structure, or planning.  For example, the virus that causes rabies, *rabies lyssavirus*, which is deadlier than small pox with only 29 known survivors world-wide, knows to infect the salivary glands *after* it has infected the brain.  This is quite rare, as the virus deliberately reverses its course of infection to return to a gland that it just recently passed on the way to the brain.  It is through the salivary glands that the virus spreads itself via biting, which is the most efficient way to spread a virus that is only spreadable via direct contact with broken skin, open sores or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth.  It *appears* as if the virus has some form of intelligence as it acts according to a very specific agenda and plan.  Is it practical, then, to consider that such as intelligence exists?

There are many questions that science doesn’t even want to consider, such as, is knowledge gained by one instance of a species shared with other instances of a species via a morphic/tholonic field, or what is the evolutionary drive for a new form of plastic-eating microbe to appear?  The concept of a planetary intelligence would suggest an answer.  The question is not which is true, survival and evolutionary adaptation as a statistical probability or as an intention of intelligence.  The question is which model offers better solutions, better models, and makes better predictions?

There are a number of “zombie” relationships that are good examples of tholonic intelligence via the competitive and/or cooperative relationships.

###  Zombie Snails

<img src='../Images/zombiesnail.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>Some of these competitive relationships between species are as terrifying as they are ingenious, such as how some parasites can take over the brain of their host and make them behave in ways that boggle the mind.  When the *green-banded broodsac* (*leucochloridium paradoxum*) gets itself inside a snail, not only does it make the snails eyes bulge out to look like a caterpillar, it “drives” the snail into open territory so that birds that like to eat caterpillars will eat it, and thereby transfer the parasite into the bird where it will lay eggs that are embedded in the bird droppings all over the countryside.  This brilliant parasite appears to have a thorough knowledge of snail neurobiology and physiology, and even though it has the mobility of a 1 cm slug, it has a birds-eye knowledge of its terrain as well as the eating habits of its preferred transport vehicle.  That’s pretty good for a creature that literally has around two brain cells, similar to the snail, which also has only two brain cells… in contrast, you have 100 billion brain cells.  Could you do that to a snail?

We often think that competition is the opposite or contrary to cooperation, but from a tholonic perspective they are the two sides, or two parents, of a concept or archetype.  Competition is what tests the viability of a concept and/or rids it of instances that are not in the parent tholon’s best interest.

### Zombie Cockroaches

One relationship that appears to be both competitive as well as cooperative is that of the *Emerald Jewel Wasp* (*ampulex compressa*) and the cockroach, where the wasp uses only the slower, less apt cockroaches for its purposes,[^88] pruning the cockroach gene pool of the less gifted, which ultimately enhances the abilities of the cockroach collective and by extension its tholonic intelligence, of which the gene pool is an instance of.

[^88]: Milius, Susan. “**How Roaches Fight off Wasps That Turn Their Victims into Zombies.**” Science News, 14 Nov. 2018, <https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-roaches-fight-wasps-turn-their-victims-zombies>

The female wasp has quite cleverly and strategically figured out that the best place to lay her eggs is inside a cockroach, as it can provide shelter (its exoskeleton) and food (its guts).  Needless to say, the cockroach is not so keen on this idea, and being much larger than the wasp, not so easy to convince.

<img src='../Images/zombieroach.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>The wasp’s solution is to sneak up on the cockroach and using her stinger she paralyzes the front section of its body.  With the patient unable to move, she carefully makes a second injection of venom that has been created specifically for this purpose and perfectly places it into a particular area of the roach’s brain past the ganglionic sheath, which is the cockroach’s brain protector.  This magic potion blocks certain receptors of neurotransmitters that destroy the roach’s fight-or-flight responses.  She has not turned the cockroach into a zombie, per se, as some have suggested, but rather into something between a zombie and a teenager in love, for as soon as the paralyzing drug wears off, rather than run, the cockroach grooms himself! It seems as though the drug injected into his brain floods it with dopamine, so the cockroach is insanely happy at this point.  He then blissfully follows his captor back to her place (an underground burrow).  There, she lays her egg on top of the swooning cockroach, then bites off its antennae and uses it like a straw to drink the cockroach’s blood.  Refreshed, she leaves the burrow (perhaps with a smile and a look that says “I’ll be right back, darling, you just relax”) and seals it with rocks.  A few days later the egg hatches and the larvae slowly consume the insides of the roach while they form a cocoon.  The cockroach finally dies, but at least he knew what it means to love.  The adult wasp then emerges from its lovesick corpse.  

It is far more reasonable to suggest that this process was created by tholonic intelligence rather than evolving by chance, especially when you consider that the wasps knows how to make the super mixture of GABA, β-alanine, and taurine together that can immobilize and zombify the cockroach when surgically administered to an extremely small brain, which the wasp knows exactly how to get to… twice.  How many millions of years would the wasp waste stinging the cockroach in the foot, the wings, the ass, the stomach, with who-knows-what variety of concoctions before she *finally* found the exact right spot in the brain and the exact right drug? Not only that, but the wasp larva is covered with a substance (mellein and micromolide) that stops the growth of all those really nasty and very tough-to-kill pathogens that live in the gut of a cockroach.  In fact, that stuff on the larvae is being investigated for use in medicine to kill antibiotic-resistant pathogens&hellip; that’s how good it is!  Did the wasp do research, comparing the pros and cons of cockroaches with dung beetles or snails, or was she just extremely lucky?  The fact that our most intelligent humans are studying the cockroach’s solution to pathogens suggests an intelligence is involved.  

### Zombie Ants

An even more compelling example from nature is that of the *cordyceps*, a parasitic fungus.  This fungus gained some notoriety in the 2013 video game *The Last of Us*, where 60% of the population has been turned into violent zombies after being infected by this parasite.  While a human strain is unlikely to exist, it is quite real for ants, for it is via ants that this fungus spreads itself into the world in the most gruesome manner. 

A single spore has the wherewithal to know when it has landed on an ant’s cuticle, as well as knowing the species of the ant it has landed on.  It then knows to enter into the ant’s body by piercing the exoskeleton using three different types of enzymes that it knows how to produce, combined with actual mechanical pressure.  Once inside, it begins to germinate and grow a mycelium network of thousands of branches that fills all the available space it can find within the insect’s tissue, which it breaks down and devours. 

<img src="../Images/zombieant.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>The fungus demonstrates a knowledge of the ant biology as it is careful to keep the vital components working because in the last moment of the ant’s life, the fungus will take over the ant’s brain, forcing it to wander off alone in search of a spot with the ideal temperature and humidity for optimal fungus growth.  Once there, the ant is compelled by the fungus to climb up some vegetation and bite down on the underside of a leaf.  The fungus is in total control and will keep the ant’s mandibles locked down until death.  During those 10 days, the fungus will feast on the ant until it is dead, at which point, it will construct a tower of spores  on its corpse which will eventually bloom into a cloud of fungal spores that drift along with the breeze.  It sounds horrifying, but if we think of the spores as sperm and the ant as the womb, it’s just your basic sex and procreation process.   As the fungus makes a point to stay near the ant colony as to increase the chances that its showering spores will infect more ants, one might think the ants will be doomed, but the ants have come up with a way to test for infected ants, and when they are detected, the healthy ants simply carry the infected ant off into the wilderness and far away, presumably with a stern warning not to return.  The fact that the healthy ants do not destroy the infected ants also suggests a cooperative relationship.

This is a very specific relationship between the zombifying class of fungi, *ophiocordyceps unilateralis*, which includes many species, and their very specific species of hosts, presumably because they need to know the specifics of their host’s anatomy and biology.  This very sophisticated technique is known among this class of fungi found in  Brazil, Colombia, USA, Australia, and Japan, all of which use a particular and similar class of ant as their hosts.  The techniques differ to the degree that their environment demands&hellip; as if this class of fungus all around the world share the same concept, which they then implement within their own varied environments.

Is it reasonable to imagine that a fungus in Australia, which has been isolated from the rest of the world for about 30 million years, happened to “discover” the same technique used in Brazil and Florida? How exactly does a fungus discover anything, let alone piece together a step-by-step plan? Through its deductive reasoning abilities?  It would be slightly more believable that this fungus “discovered” this technique if the isolated instances used the generally similar idea but with different technical specs, such as different hosts with radically different biology, such as beetles or spiders; but to use the same class of ants as their long lost cousins from the other side of the planet? 

This fungus also seems to be very enterprising, as recently there has been as many as 15 new species within *ophiocordyceps unilateralis* that have come into existence.

Ironically,  cordyceps are of great benefit to humans, so much so that humans have been catching, drying, and grinding these poor spore-fill corpses to be used as medicine.  Some of the benefits are said to be:  increased physical performance, anti-aging, heart health, anti-tumor, helps with type-2 diabetes, and fighting inflammation.  Perhaps this clever fungus has found yet another way to ensure its survival.

The tholonic view of this is that it is the tholonic intelligence of both archetypes ( and humans) that are behind the amazingly sophisticated techniques, strategies, adaptation, planning, forethought, chemistry, etc.

### Zombie Ideas

From the tholonic perspective, competitive (invasive, controlling, etc.) intelligences exist in the same way when it comes to ideas, beliefs, desires, and even reasoning to the degree that such an intelligence can infiltrate these areas.  The most obvious examples of this can be found in cultural and religious beliefs stretching back to the beginning of ancient history, that we know of, and probably a lot sooner.  

Algonquin tribes of North America have a term that neatly describes this same concept: “Wetiko“.  This is the word for the concept of a parasitic spirit that deludes its host into believing that cannibalizing the life-force of other life forms, animal, human or otherwise, is advantageous and drives the host to greed, excess, and selfish consumption.  It's a concept that exists across the world; in the Buddhist concept of *Taṇhā* (mental or physical thirst, desire, longing, greed); in Islam as the concept of the *Nafs* (the lusts); in Taoism as the concept of "people-eating ghosts" called *Jikininki*.  The ancient Greeks called it *pneuma akatharton*, which is a Greek translation from the original words in the Torah, and literally translates to "unclean breath" or "unclean spirit", and is the source of the Christian concept of "evil spirit".  In a more secular context, we might call it the essence of the *service-to-self* spirit as opposed to the *service-to-others* spirit, which we can also understand as *self-preservation* vs. *preservation of that which the self serves*, or that which the self is part of.

In this modern world of civilization and technology, we are at our most vulnerable to these mind-viruses, these conceptual parasites, because we have more access to information, ideas, beliefs, ideologies than ever before, but no knowledge of the dangers that lie in waiting in the conceptual jungle that most of us are aimlessly wandering through with no idea that our own psyches are a vast and fertile land for these intelligences to feed on and breed in.  Freely sharing and expressing ideas with everyone is not that much different from freely sharing and expressing sex with everyone, and social media has become something of a non-stop digital *Saturnalia*, complete with its own versions of orgies, feasting, drunkenness, running naked through the streets, and generally making a lot of noise.  We are already seeing the unexpected side-effects. 

Pondering such things leads to the inevitable existential question that we all ask ourselves at one time or another" "Why does such evil exist?" or the slightly lazier form of "Can't we all just get along?" The lazy tholonic answer is: “They must exist because they can exist”, but the deeper answer is that existence is the result of opposing forces finding a balance, and growth is the result of these forces working that balance out.  Culturally, we have come to understand these forces as constructive and destructive, positive and negative, good and bad, etc.  Tholonically, they are the forces that define, limit, reduce, constrict, divide, and the forces that join, integrate, contribute, grow, multiply.

The reality is, parasitic, competitive, aggressive, violent, and destructive ideologies work[^90].  In some cases they are necessary and even an asset to the ‘victim’, such as in the wasp/cockroach arrangement where an individual roach may suffer, but the species benefits. In other cases they may extract a heavy toll and appear to be not very sustainable, but they certainly can exist long enough to justify their existence.  They also serve a critical purpose as an evolutionary force from a broader perspective.

Nature is unbiased regarding creation or destruction, health and disease.  Small Pox, amphibian-killing chytrid fungus, and feral cats are just another form of existence looking to survive and thrive but happen to be pretty incompatible with some other life forms trying to do the same;  humans, amphibians, and the now-extinct ground-dwelling birds, respectively.  It's not that nature doesn't have a horse in the survival/evolution race, so to speak; it's that nature has all the horses in all the races.  Nature has no favorites among its own forces and their consequential creations and deletions.

Tholonically, parasitic zombifying mind-viruses are as reasonable to presume to exist as parasitic zombifying brain-viruses, which we know exist.  While we think of such things as "evil" or "bad", and undoubtedly unfortunate for those who succumb to them, they are one of the many forces that shape the form of life.  In some forms of adaptation, deadly viruses can be a lifesaver.  The reason why there are far more gray squirrels than red squirrels in England is because the gray squirrels have become immune to the squirrel pox virus and carry it in their bodies, but the red squirrels have not.  The gray squirrels created a sustainable relationship with this otherwise deadly virus, which now protects them not only from that virus but from encroaching red squirrels.  Bacteria are also known to adapt to deadly viruses and carry them as a defense weapon against other bacteria[^92].  This is a good example of how self-preservation of the species can require the sacrifice of individual members.

## Findhorn

This idea of objective intelligences was also known among the founders of the miraculous Scottish community founded in 1962 called Findhorn.  The founders claim they managed to turn their arid desert-like terrain into a lush garden by communicating with the spirits (i.e.  tholonic intelligence) of the plants, and of Earth itself, who guided them on how to properly use the soil despite it being very poor quality.  Soon, they were producing 40-pound cabbages.  Stunned horticultural experts from around the world came to see this miracle garden.

They also claim they managed pest control, as they use no chemicals or pesticides, by forming cooperative relationships with the collective intelligences of each species; the deer, the bugs, the rabbits, etc.  Reportedly this worked very well with all the species except one.  The rat was not interested in any “deal” and stood firm in its “it’s either you or us” position.  The last part is anecdotal, as it was told to me personally, but what is not anecdotal is Findhorn’s phenomenal success in horticulture in an area considered impossible for what they have accomplished.

There are countless examples of tholonic cooperation and competition, and some of them are even being studied.  The Canadian anthropologist Jeremy Narby does a great job of this (inadvertently) in his book *The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the origins of knowledge*, which he wrote after living several years in the Amazon studying the shamanic knowledge of botanics.  His book explores the relationships and similarities between indigenous knowledge and our modern understanding of molecular biology, medicine, and DNA.  We won’t get into his amazing discoveries here, other than to say that their understanding demonstrates some sort of access to knowledge far beyond what could reasonably be considered to have been passed down by folklore and legend.  It is well worth the read.

## The Cambrian Explosion 

*This subject is a little out of place here, but no matter where it was placed it seemed out of place.  Because we are looking at tholonic intelligence, and this is specifically related to tholonic intelligence, it seemed to be somewhat applicable.*

The Cambrian explosion is a good example of a world-changing reorganization of tholonic hierarchy and integration that took place over 530 million years ago.  If you ask a historian what caused the Cambrian explosion, they will tell you it was starbursts from the Milky Way, or genomic reorganization, or geochemical/environmental causes, such as photosynthesis which raised oxygen levels.  However, they will all agree that whatever the cause, there were many, many interlinked and codependent processes.  All these explanations are not really explanations, but rather descriptions; this happened, then that happened, then another thing happened causing more things to happen...  But why did it happen? In every answer to that question, the “why” is simply a description of the effects of some other cause, and when we don’t know the cause, we hypothesize a cause that could explain the effects (which become the causes).  Many of these *theories of causes* turn out to be correct, as we would expect, considering that this reality is made *only* of effects, which serves as causes for more effects.

From the tholonic perspective, there are three types of causes.

- **The originating intention**.  This is the 0-dimensional single dot that expanded itself through awareness of itself.  Science sees this as the Big Bang.
- **The cause of effects.** Effects that act as causes in a cascading chains of events.  These are actually children of the original cause or intention, but as that is beyond our comprehension, we can only understand what we perceive.
- **The intention to cause**.  This is a cause that is initiated by the willful intention of an intelligence.  The easiest example of this is when we decide to do something, like turn on a light.  Currently, we understand that willful intention is only exercised by higher forms of life, but from the tholonic understanding, tholons themselves can exert willful intention if we accept the definition of “will” as *disposition* or *inclination*, as tholons have a natural disposition and inclination because, as archetypes, they are *a pattern that expressions of energy diverge from and/or converge towards*.

The answer to “Why was there a Cambrian explosion?”, or any event for that matter, big or small, across all contexts, is that it was the most efficient and stable expression of energy at the time, arrived at through cooperation and/or conflict, that was compatible with the intentions and forces of all the contributing tholons.
