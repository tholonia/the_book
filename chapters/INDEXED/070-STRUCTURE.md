# 7: STRUCTURE

###### Knowledge and <u>information</u>, like form, have <u>structures</u> that follow the same rules as form.
##### **Synopsis:** Structure is the relationship between elements, so anything that relates to anything has a <u>structure</u>.  This is also true the <u>conceptual</u> <u>structures</u> of <u>data</u>, <u>information</u>, <u>knowledge</u>, and <u>understanding</u>, all of which are limited and defined by <u>order</u>, context and application and all of which are formed by relationships.  Structure is self-similar, therefore it <u>hierarchical</u> in <u>nature</u>.  All instances of a <u>structure</u> share the same fundamental properties of that <u>structure</u>.

Everything up until now was to introduce some of the main <u>concepts</u> that we will be returning to and depending on as we move forward an into the main <u>ideas</u> that lead from the ultimate simplicity of a duality to more complex <u>structures</u> that describe the reality we actually live in.

On a practical level, this <u>complexity</u> is no different than how we deal with the physical world in our every-day lives.  When you hold a brick in your hand you are holding trillions of <u>atomic</u> particles, with countless interactions, fields, <u>energy</u> levels, etc., but you don’t need to know that to build a house of bricks.  When you drop the brick and it falls, you’re not thinking about the <u>nature</u> of time, gravity, and warped space.  Likewise, to manage the “bricks” in the realm of Ideas, you also don’t need to know all of the details, but it is helpful if you have an <u>understanding</u> of how they generally interact with each other so you don’t try and build a “house” made of “bricks” and “oranges”.

That said, let’s touch on one more <u>concept</u> that is fundamental to <u>structure</u> in general.

## How Many Dimensions Are There?

There are two <u>concepts</u> of dimension to consider, *location* and *instance*.  

The location of a thing relates a thing to its environment and assumes that the thing we are measuring, the environment it exists in, and the measurer all share the same reality.  There’s no arguing that material things are 3-dimensional, and that our environment is also 3-dimensional.  Sure, there may be more than 3 dimensions, such as time, but there are at least 3 dimensions that are well established and very persistent.  

The measurement of an instance of something, an object, is absolute, relative to itself.  A 1cm<sup>3</sup> sugar cube (and its measurer) traveling at near the <u>speed of light</u> will still measure 1cm<sup>3</sup> &hellip;to the measurer. To a stationary bystander, that sugar cube will appear to be the size of a Borg Cube mothership, and certainly not 1cm<sup>3</sup>.  This is due to Relativity, but the point being made here is simply that the consistency of our 3D world is due to the fact that we, the <u>planet</u>, and everything in our reality. are all in the same space-time neighborhood.  

Longitude, latitude, and altitude works perfectly well for geographical locations, as does right ascension, declination, and distance for celestial locations.  3D coordinates <u>work</u> because, and only when, all things are generally in the same neighborhood of space-time reality. We ignore the differences in our own neighborhood because they are too small to bother with, but they exist.  If you fall from 100ft in Peru, you will hit the ground 16 milliseconds sooner than if you fall in the Arctic.  Peru has more gravity than the Arctic, and that means time moves slower in Peru, but no one is going to notice or care, just like we don’t care in every second of our <u>life</u> we travel at least 669 km (415 miles/sec) or 2,410,153 km/hr (1,497,600 mile/hr) across various dimensions and scopes if you account for the <u>movement</u> of the Earth, Sun, and <u>Milky Way</u>. The point here is, *location* coordinates can *only* be relative to the local environment. 

The classic explanation of a dimension goes something like *“If something has only one dimension you only need one <u>number</u> to know its exact location”.* In the case of 1-dimension, like in the <u>number</u> line below, if there was a dot on <u>number</u> 6, the dot has a dimension of 6.

<img src='../Images/035-numnberline.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>This is true when, and only when, the position of the measurer and the thing being measured share the same context, as the value of 6 is only relative to that context.  If we wanted to give the absolute position of the dot, we would need to include the coordinates of where in the universe that dot exists, which would require the coordinates of who-knows-how-many larger contexts it was in when it was measured; where on the planet, in the solar system, in the galaxy, in the multiverse, and all of those with the dimension of time, as they are all moving, and even then it would only be relative to the Universe as we know it.  So, even a simple 1-dimensional dot can have a lot of dimensions when measured from a broader context.

It’s as if we have *subjective* dimensions, which are dimensions relative to the thing alone,  and *objective* dimensions, which are the dimensions of the thing relative to all other things (the Universe), which seems ironic as this would equate *subjective* with *absolute*, and *objective* with *relative*.

## Things

<img src='../Images/036-tetrahedron.png' style='float:right;width:15%'/>What can we say about what all *things* have in common? Well, we can say at least the following:

-   All things have 3 dimensions.
-   All things are made of other things (except the “first” thing?).
-   All things are the most efficient form of that specific thing.

This last statement might raise a few eyebrows.  The claim here is not that any particular thing is the most efficient form of its perfect <u>archetype</u>, but rather the most efficient form for that particular thing under the conditions it exists in any particular moment.

If these statements are true, then this would imply that the most primitive thing that can exist, the simplest and most efficient form possible, is the tetrahedron.  It has 3 dimensions, but it is *not* made up of other things because when you remove any one point, it collapses to 2 dimensions, and no *thing* can be 2D.  Therefore, it must be the very first *thing* to come into <u>existence</u>, at least <u>conceptually</u> speaking.

It can be argued that it is the sphere, not the tetrahedron, that holds this title, and this is not incorrect.  From the <u>tholonic</u> perspective, both forms are the same with a minor difference.  Let’s use the simpler example of a triangle and a circle. In one sense, the circle is more fundamental because it can be created with simply one line, while a triangle requires three lines.  However, if we accept that the path of least <u>resistance</u> is represented by the shortest distance between two points (all else being equal), then while a circle is easy to make, is certainly not the most efficient.  While a triangle is a polygon of 3 straight lines, a circle is a polygon of an infinite <u>number</u> of straight lines, each line being infinitely short.  This then defines a circle as an infinite <u>number</u> of triangles.  The <u>reason</u> we consider the circle and the triangle (or tetrahedron and sphere) the same is because the triangle is a *single* instance of the simplest form, and the circle is an *infinite* <u>number</u> of instances of that same form.  The only difference between the two forms is *quantitative*, not *qualitative*.  The circle is the most efficient form that can be produced by the most efficient form of triangle.  Very little in <u>nature</u> and reality can be described with only a single tetrahedron, but everything can be described as multiple tetrahedrons, and a sphere is just that, it is therefore the most efficient form in <u>nature</u>.

As a <u>pattern</u> of <u>order</u>, the tetrahedron (and the resulting sphere it creates) is one of the first, if not *the* first, to appear in <u>nature</u>.  When we stack spheres on top of one another, they form a tetrahedron.  If we stack other shapes, the <u>structure</u> will be altered to the degree the shape is not a sphere, but the tendency for all things that are connected to each other will be to form a tetrahedral <u>structure</u> to the degree the shape of the things connected will allow.  As it is the tendency of all things to become spherical, thanks to gravity in the case of matter, and entropy in the case of liquids, it is then also the tendency for things to form tetrahedral connections.  Tetrahedrons are the first <u>pattern</u> of <u>order</u> and the <u>archetype</u> that represents the path of least <u>resistance</u>.

If the tetrahedron is the first thing that can be created, this would suggest also that every *thing* that exists can be reduced to a collection of tetrahedrons, and that they are the smallest *thing* that can exist (again, <u>conceptually</u> speaking).  This might sound like a radical departure from our current thinking, but it’s not *that* radical a departure as this is exactly what *Emergence Theory: A Theory of Pixelated Spacetime”*[^52] claims as well.

> In our 3D quasicrystalline reality, the tetrahedron is the smallest, indivisible unit.  A 3D pixel of reality, if you will.  Each tetrahedron is the smallest possible 3D shape that can exist in this reality: the length of each of its edges is the <u>Planck length</u> (the shortest possible length known in physics – over 10<sup>35</sup> times smaller than a meter).  These 3D pixels combine with one another according to specific, geometric rules, to populate all of space.  **~ “Emergence Theory Overview”.  Quantum Gravity Research[^53]**

[^53]: "**Emergence Theory Overview.**" Quantum Gravity Research. Accessed August 07, 2020. https://quantumgravityresearch.org/lay-person-overview.

The <u>tholonic</u> model that this book describes suggests that the rules that apply to these 3D pixels that populate all of space extent beyond space to all of reality, including the invisible worlds of <u>ideas</u>, <u>archetypes</u>, and all forms and expressions of <u>energy</u>.

## On the Small Side

Science has been grappling with the idea of tiny particles for some time.  First, we had the grains of sand and dust, then <u>atoms</u>, then <u>electrons</u>, protons, and neutrons, then finally, <u>quarks</u>, which, so far, seem to be the most fundamental layer of matter.  The problem is, <u>quarks</u> are “almost” infinitely small, which creates all sorts of problems because <u>science</u> has a difficult time with <u>infinity</u>.  To solve this, they came up with the idea that reality is not made of really tiny particles, but really tiny vibrating 11-dimensional “superstrings” (and they thought this would be easier?). Unfortunately, for all the evidence they have found to support this theory they might as well have said reality is made up of angels dancing on pinheads.

The <u>quark</u> remains the undefeated champion of tinyness, but “almost” infinitely small is not the same as infinitely small.  How “almost” is it? One 43 billion-billionths of a centimeter (0.43 x 10<sup>-17</sup> meters).  Remember that <u>number</u>, 10<sup>-17</sup>.

## On the Big Side

Jumping to the other end of the scale we have some pretty big things in the universe, the largest we know of being the *Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall.* This is a gravitationally bound galactic supercluster about 10 billion light-years wide.  That is pretty, pretty big.  What could be bigger than that? How about something with 4 dimensions? Would an extra dimension increase the size of something? Well, is a 2&times;2&times;2 cube bigger than a 2&times;2 sheet of paper, and is a 2&times;2&times;2&times;2 hyper-cube bigger that a 2&times;2&times;2 cube? What would a 2&times;2&times;2&times;2 cube look like? In the 3D world, from one perspective it would look like a regular cube, because we can only see 3 of the 4 dimensions, but turn it a little (in 4D space) and the 4D cube will appear as two 3D cubes, or a hexagonal prism, or rhombic dodecahedron, or a cuboid.

Here is what a hyper-cube (4D cube) looks like when it is rotated and projected onto a 2D space, like a shadow (orthographic projection).

<center><img src='../Images/037-hypercubeisos.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

What about something that is 5D, or 6D or 7D? Each one would be bigger by an <u>order</u> of magnitude.  How about something that is 248D? That would be very, very big.  If something was bigger than the Great Wall in 248D how small could it appear in 3D? About the size of a small travel bag!! OK, you’re probably thinking *“248D!? That’s ridiculous!”*

## Crystal Power

So, there’s this magic 248-dimensional <u>crystal</u> (actually, it’s 8 dimensional with 248 not-necessarily-spatial, but not *not*-necessarily-spatial, dimensional symmetries, but as an algebraic expression it is considered to have 248 dimensions&hellip; at least that is what I am told[^320]) called the *E8 <u>crystal</u>*, and this reality of ours is, presumably, the result of a <u>number</u> of 3D refractions of <u>energy</u> created by the various facets of this <u>crystal</u> that are cast upon the 3D canvas of the void that is our universe from the higher dimensions of magic-crystal-land.  As modern as this sounds, this was first proposed in the late 1800s, but it has only been recently that we have the computing power to give it a test drive.  This sounds pretty compatible with the <u>Simulation</u> Hypothesis.  Maybe these two theories should get together for coffee sometime.

[^320]: Interestingly, there is a relatively unknown young man, Matias De Stefano,  who was born in 1987 in a small town outside of Buenos Aries, Argentina, where he still lives, and who claims that not only was he born with full memory of his existence prior to being born, but that his "job" in his pre-incarnate reality was that of an "information specialist" or "librarian" of sorts, collecting, managing and disseminating information from all realities and dimensions.  He claims he has returned to earth to finish a mission he began thousands of years ago but failed to complete. Whether one believes his claims or not, it is hard not to be impressed with his detailed, clear, rational, and somewhat technical explanation regarding the structure and nature of reality.  He is mentioned here because, coincidentally, he explains: *"The 8th dimension is where you can see everything from one spot. The 8th dimension has the information of everything,  of every second over millions of years, from every perspective of the universe".*  For what it's worth, he also says each dimension has its own form of technology, and the 9th dimension is a black hole, *"The place and time where there is no place or time"*, and the last dimension that exists in the physical reality.  Theosophists and anthroposophists call this 8 dimensional reality the *Akashic Records*, which is described as a compendium of all universal events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intentions ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future. Here we have a Magic Crystal that is hypothesized as the source of all creation, past, and future and also happens to also be 8 dimensions.  This is mentioned not to lend or remove any validity to these various models of reality but to show how similar conceptual patterns are expressed via different philosophies and perspectives; scientific, mathematical, metaphysical, or mystical. I also mention him here because his explanation of reality is entirely compatible with the Tholonic model, albeit less technically detailed but more complex, so for those more meta-physically aligned, his perspective may be valuable.

As crazy as this theory sounds, it’s a real thing.  Just do an Internet search for “*emergence theory tetrahedron”* and *“The theory of everything quantum symmetry E8 lattice”* and browse through the million-plus links that discuss it in painful detail, emphasis on the *painful* part, because most of the content is unintelligible to those not intimately familiar with the algebra of differentiable manifolds, quantum gravity and a bunch of other stuff I don’t even know how to reference.  However, that is not important to know for our purposes.

It should be stated that this theory is not accepted by all, and some scientists are definitely in the “swarming with worms of heretical perversity” camp regarding the magic <u>crystal</u> of reality.  I don’t have any opinion about the Emergence Theory (ET) other than it sounds fascinating, mainly because I am not qualified to have an opinion.  The only <u>reason</u> it is being mentioned is because ET supports many of the claims that are made here, which were arrived at with no <u>knowledge</u> of ET.

This E8 lattice (that’s its technical name, also called a *quasicrystal*, but *magic <u>crystal</u>* sounds much cooler) seems to be able to describe all sorts of things: space-time (both types, Minkowski and Kaluza-Klein versions.  Yes, we have two types of space-time, because it’s always better to have options), fermion particles, gravity, subspace, dark matter, <u>quarks</u>, positrons, neutrinos, Fibonacci relationships, and a bunch of other stuff, including “ghost particles” (which are really, really old neutrinos that were created during the <u>Big Bang</u> 15 billion years ago and have no charge, no <u>mass</u> and do not interact with any of the forces that form matter.  Doesn’t that make them simply *<u>concepts</u>* only of something that once existed?).

Obviously, it is impossible to visualize such a <u>crystal</u> as it has countless <u>patterns</u> in the 3D world, but here a few of these ways it can be perceived.

<center><img src='../Images/e8s.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

As you can see, the whole space-time part of the E8 lattice is just a small part of one of the 3D projections of an 8D slice of a 248D super-thing, leading one to wonder what other forms of reality it has the magic power to conjure up.  Not surprisingly, this E8 lattice can be deconstructed to (or perhaps is constructed by) a series of tetrahedrons.[^54]<sup>,</sup>[^56]

A significant aspect of *Emergence Theory* (for us) is their claim that:

> &hellip;all of reality is made of <u>information</u>.  What is <u>information</u>? Information is meaning conveyed by symbols.  Languages and codes are groups of such symbols that convey meaning.  The various possible arrangements of these symbols are governed by rules.[^55]

Just as a fun comparison, check out the following cymatic <u>patterns</u>.  With very little <u>effort</u> we can imagine how reality and the Universe is like a 248D drum filled with <u>energy</u> and vibrating in all <u>frequencies</u>.

<center><img src='../Images/040-cymaticscolor.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The E8 <u>crystal</u> of *quantum symmetry* and *emergence theory* hypothesize that all matter is a projection of countless “pixels” that are really, really small tetrahedrons[^57], each about 1.61 x 10<sup>-35</sup> meters in size.  Remember the size of a <u>quark</u>, 10<sup>-17</sup>? This is a *lot* smaller.

[^57]: Amazing description of how the E8 crystal can be defined as tetrahedrals. <https://quantumgravityresearch.org/portfolio/a-deep-link-between-3d-and-8d>

It might sound like this is mixing apples and multidimensional oranges, using definitions from *emergence theory* on one side of the scale, and definitions from *quantum symmetry* on the other side, but both of these theories integrate <u>quantum mechanics</u>, general and special relativity, the standard model and other mainstream physics theories to form a complete, fundamental picture of a universe unfolding from implicity to explicity.  The main difference between these two models is that the *E8 Crystal* describes the mechanics of creation, while the *emergence theory* attempts to describe the syntax of its operation using the <u>language</u> of geometry.

#### **Key 45:** Geometry and mathematics are the <u>language</u> of <u>archetypes</u>.

Here we have a duality that encompasses the entire spectrum of 3D reality, at least.  On one end, the *alphahedron*, which is the smallest <u>structure</u> theoretically possible, that being the tetrahedron, and on the other end, the *omegahedron*, the most complex <u>structure</u> in <u>existence</u>, which currently seems to be the 248D-ish magic <u>crystal</u>.

## The Structure of Knowledge

Now we can begin to integrate dualities into the <u>holarchy</u>.

#### **Key 46:** Just as <u>subatomic particles</u> are <u>structured</u> <u>energy</u>, <u>atoms</u> are <u>structured</u> particles, and <u>molecules</u> are <u>structured</u> <u>atoms</u>, <u>information</u> is <u>structured</u> <u>data</u>, <u>knowledge</u> is <u>structured</u> <u>information</u>, and <u>ideas</u> are <u>structured</u> <u>knowledge</u>.

#### **Key 47:** The <u>concept</u> of a thing and the thing itself are the same things on two different levels of <u>order</u>.

Both scopes of matter and <u>ideas</u> represent how a form of pure <u>energy</u> in its chaotic state is converted into <u>order</u> using the same <u>laws</u> as they apply to the relevant contexts of their <u>scope</u>.  In one case,  <u>energy</u> is ordered and expressed as matter and in the latter case as <u>concepts</u>.  This is how it relates to holarchies, as holarchies can map not only the naturally occurring <u>hierarchy</u> of the <u>concepts</u> of *reality* (<u>atoms</u>, plants, people, etc.) but also the <u>concept</u> of *<u>concepts</u>* (domains of <u>science</u>, <u>religions</u>, culture, etc.).

<center><img src='../Images/041-holons-to-tree.png' style='width:40%'/></center>

If we applied our <u>ideas</u> regarding duality to the <u>holarchy</u> it would look something like this graph (above): We start with a <u>concept</u> *XY<sub>0</sub>*, followed by its thesis *Y<sub>1</sub> , which creates its antithesis *X<sub>1</sub>* .  Within this duality of *X<sub>n</sub>* and *Y<sub>n</sub>* , or thesis and antithesis, arises the synthesis that acts as the <u>seed</u> for a new <u>concept</u> *XY<sub>1</sub>* .  The <u>holarchy</u> can only accommodate the central column of <u>concepts</u> as it has no model of a <u>concept</u> being born within a duality.

This graph only shows one instance per duality, but there could be many, many instances for each duality, the occurrence of which conform to the <u>Bell curve</u> as defined by the *X<sub>n</sub>* and *Y<sub>n</sub>* limits of each new pair.

Some readers might recognize this graph as looking very similar to the mystical Kabbalah, or the Tree of Life, as it is also called, which has its roots in ancient Sumer.  There was no <u>intention</u> to arrive at such a comparison, but these similarities naturally arise whenever we are using <u>reason</u> to explain how reality works regardless of its <u>understanding</u> being scientific, mystical, or otherwise.  Any system that has <u>order</u> will follow a <u>pattern</u>, and we can see these same <u>patterns</u> over and over again, from the <u>electron</u> to the galaxy, from flowers to computer networking.  Our explanations of how realities <u>work</u>, whether we believe it was created by God in 6 days, or it’s all a very sophisticated <u>holographic</u> projection, will have the same <u>patterns</u> of reasoning, albeit with different back-stories and interpretations of the significance of those <u>patterns</u>.

<center><img src='../Images/042-related-patterns.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

## Knowledge by any other name

We tend to think that ancient <u>ideas</u> were not based in <u>science</u>, at least in the way we describe that word today.  This is partly true, in that we had not yet discovered the <u>laws</u> of <u>nature</u> to the degree, or in the manner, we now have, but we can find incredibly sophisticated reasoning and logic in some ancient <u>ideas</u>.

<img src='../Images/kabalah-iching.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>Take two examples mentioned above, the Taoist I-Ching and the Kabbalah.  Both have a tremendous body of impressive intellectual reasoning, and both are descriptions of the same larger concept of a reality that exists in a duality as seen through the contextual cultural lens of understanding.  While the Kabbalah is a top-down model of creation that describes 10 archetypal states 32 archetypes made up of 10 archetypal states of existence with 22 archetypes of energy that connect these states (and based on the Hebrew alphabet of 22 characters and 10 numbers), the I-Ching is a fractally bifurcated whole of 10 pairs of balanced states and 22 pairs of imbalanced states that describe 32 pairs of archetypal states of the Tao. 

The story of the I-Ching and Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, the co-inventor (along with Newton) of differential and integral calculus, is a fascinating story that exemplifies this <u>cultural</u> lens.  It’s a bit of an aside, but it’s relevant and worth the read.

### Leibniz

When the Jesuits, reputed to be the intellectuals among <u>Christian</u> missionaries, traveled to China, they were so fascinated by the I-Ching that they brought it back to Europe in the late 1600s.  It was here that Leibniz saw the I-Ching and claimed it to be sent to him by God.[^58]

[^58]: **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**. (n.d.). <http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz>**, Leibniz and the I-Ching**. (n.d.). <http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Binary_number#/Leibniz_and_the_I_Ching>

Prior to seeing the I-Ching, Leibniz had been developing (discovering?) a <u>number</u> system since 1679 that he considered sacred and which he described in his 1703 article, *Explication de l'Arithmétique Binaire*.  It was the binary system of 0s and 1s, much like the Yin/Yang of the I-Ching.  It was of no real practical use to anyone at the time, but that was not why he developed it.  Leibniz, a very pious man, thought that if all values could be expressed in terms of only something and nothing, on and off, yes and no, positive and negative, etc., then truly, this would be the <u>language</u> of <u>life</u>, for, as he thought, God the Creator was represented as 1, while the void was represented as 0.

Leibniz's principal <u>work</u> on this topic was his <u>ideas</u> on *monism*, as he called it.  In short, he describes how each substance is *programmed* to act in a predetermined way and is integrated with all other substances according to a preexisting *archetypal* harmony. The most, and only essential substance was the simplest, which he described as  “that which is one, has no parts and is therefore indivisible" and from which all other substances emerged from, i.e. God.

At the same time he was inventing this *divine <u>math</u>* meant to explore the hidden secrets of reality, he was also inventing the first mechanical calculator suitable not only for addition and subtraction but for multiplication as well.  His dream was to make a logical thinking device.[^59]

[^59]: **Gottfried Leibniz**. (n.d.). Retrieved from <http://history-computer.com/Dreamers/Leibniz.html>

Leibniz was creating <u>tools</u> for exoteric and esoteric <u>understanding</u>, both based on the same logic, but within two very different contexts.  Leibniz's sacred <u>math</u> was lost to obscurity, until it was (coincidentally) resuscitated some 300-years later at the pre-dawn of the digital computer.  

To synopsize the entire digital revolution into one paragraph, imagine one of these digital pioneers saying: “I’ve got an idea.  let’s develop a component that will act as a conductor when a certain amount of <u>voltage</u> is passed through it, and an insulator when no <u>voltage</u> is passed through it.  We will call this component a ‘gate’. Because this gate can only respond to one of two states, high or low <u>voltage</u>, yes or no, so to speak, which represents the most basic principles of reasoning, we will call it a ‘logic gate’. Any problem that can be reduced into so many yes-or-no conditions can be calculated by these logic gates.  We can use the <u>numbers</u> 1 and 0 to represent these states as digits.  Because the <u>heart</u> of these <u>electronic</u> machines will be made up of these yes-or-no circuits, we will call them ‘*digital circuits’”*, and the digital computer as we know it today was invented.

If Leibniz was alive today to see his sacred binary <u>math</u> of 1s and 0s being used as the <u>language</u> of his ‘thinking machine’, ushering in the greatest transformation of <u>knowledge</u> ever known to Man, he would recognize it as both a <u>tool</u> of practical use as well as a <u>tool</u> of great esoteric <u>potential</u>, a key to the secret <u>knowledge</u> he was looking for.

### The Source of Ideas

We like to think we come up with <u>ideas</u>, but perhaps this is no truer than a flower “deciding” to change colors when exposed to different light, or a river “deciding” to change course because the wolf population has increased.[^60]

[^60]: Abrantes, R. (2018, November 19). **How Wolves Change Rivers** \| Ethology Institute \| Read and Watch Now. Retrieved from <https://ethology.eu/how-wolves-change-rivers>

Although currently not a mainstream theory, the <u>understanding</u> that Ideas are more like expressions of living intelligences that we have a symbiotic relationship with is currently alive and well, and has been around for thousands of years.  Traditionally, these forms of <u>intelligence</u> and <u>intention</u> were anthropomorphized into deities, angels, demons, spirits, etc., and it was understood that we use them for our purposes, noble and otherwise, and they use us for their purposes, noble or otherwise.  Today we have new evidenced-based hypotheses of this same <u>concept</u> in the forms of <u>panpsychism</u>, morphic fields, <u>collective</u> (un)<u>consciousness</u>, Universal mind, etc.  From this perspective, all forms of <u>life</u> are simply instances of various Ideas and <u>concepts</u> that have instantiated themselves.

One of the fundamental differences in how similar <u>concepts</u> evolve over time is in what and how <u>structure</u> is applied to the idea.  Take, for example, the idea of the biblical creation story vs. reality-as-a-simulation hypothesis.  We can see by their similarity that they are clearly the same <u>concept</u>, but one filtered and defined through the belief <u>structures</u> of Judeo-Christian doctrine and the other through the <u>structured</u> reasoning of modern <u>science</u>.

The above was a somewhat circuitous route to get to this point of looking at <u>knowledge</u> as a form of <u>structured</u> <u>information</u> and how it is not only the basis of <u>reason</u> but the basis of <u>existence</u> as well.  It was stated before that the tetrahedron is the most fundamental <u>concept</u> of form.  We are going a step further here and also claiming that the tetrahedron is also the <u>structure</u> that <u>information</u> takes when it forms <u>knowledge</u>.

How would we begin to test such an idea?  We can start in the same way we would test the idea of a tetrahedron, by deconstructing it into its even more basic component, the triangle, and if we can discover a triad of <u>information</u>, we can form a tetrahedron of <u>knowledge</u>.  We have already seen one fundamental <u>pattern</u> (Newton's 2<sup>nd</sup> Law) that discovers a 4<sup>th</sup> point from any 3 points, so perhaps we can learn something more from just a triangle.

What follows are some examples of how we might identify <u>conceptual</u> trinities in a wide variety of systems of <u>knowledge</u> and/or <u>information</u>.

### Language

In the realm of <u>ideas</u>, the most important <u>tool</u> that man has deployed has been <u>language</u>.  Language transmits the reasoning behind <u>ideas</u>; it is how <u>ideas</u> evolve, how they are destroyed and how they defend themselves, which, according to Dawkins, they do, as he explains in his book “The Selfish Gene”.  As such, we would expect to see <u>language</u> embedded with the same <u>structure</u> as that of <u>ideas</u>, <u>concepts</u>, and forms.

Humans are sort of stuck with the <u>language</u> we have been using for thousands of years, and if we were to (and when we do) invent a new <u>language</u> it would look radically different, but it would probably function similarly because all naturally evolved languages follow a <u>law</u> based on mathematical statistics that also approximate the same <u>laws</u> of <u>science</u>.  This amazing <u>pattern</u> of <u>language</u> was discovered in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and is called Zipf’s Law (which when normalized is called the Riemann Zeta Function) and is fundamental to everything from the diffraction of light to the size of craters on the moon.  This is another topic, but the point here is that <u>language</u> evolves according to, and limited by, the same forces that drive all <u>evolution</u>, growth and change.

This applies to intentionally designed languages as well.  In 1968, Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht, designed a symbolic <u>language</u> called *L-system* that incorporated various symbols that were bound by a set of rules.  He developed this <u>language</u> as a way to model and describe the behavior of plants and a variety of other organisms[^61].  The philosophy and architecture of the <u>language</u> were based on the observed logic of growth, i.e. <u>life</u>.  Not coincidentally, this <u>language</u> describes self-similar systems.  This is the <u>language</u> of the future, but sadly, only for our digital offspring, at least not until we do some major gray matter rewiring upstairs.

<center><img src='../Images/043-l-system-trees.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Granted, <u>L-System</u> <u>language</u> is mainly used as a modeling <u>language</u>, but has an alphabet, grammatical roots, and rules, like human <u>language</u>[^62].  This is brought up to show that organically evolved systems that have survived the challenges of sustainability, such as human <u>language</u>, exhibit similar characteristics to the highly ordered, <u>structured</u>, and <u>hierarchical</u> systems that describe <u>life</u> itself.

[^62]: In that it applies the syntactic features of natural languages. This is mentioned in the book: Prusinkiewicz, Przemyslaw, et al. **The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants**. Springer, 1996. This book is also available online. The relevant chapter is http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch1.pdf. This site in general is an excellent resource for algorithms of nature.

Although human <u>language</u> is surprisingly efficient and operates with the same <u>structure</u> that naturally exists in <u>ideas</u> and <u>concepts</u>, its efficiency is greatly due to our <u>brain</u>’s ability to apply context and instantly run through many interpretations of words and sentence <u>structure</u> until it finds the most contextually applicable interpretation.  This is entropy in action, as each possible interpretation is a microstate that the <u>brain</u> has to instantly field-test.  Take the sentences:

>   I didn’t sleep with your mother.
>
>   I didn’t hit a man with a stick.

Say the first sentence 5 times, each time putting the stress on a different word.  This sentence has the equivalent of 5 <u>microstates</u>, and depending on the context of who/what/where/when/why, the <u>brain</u> will calculate the highest probability of its intended meaning.  Likewise, the second sentence has potentially 16 <u>microstates</u>, as there are 8 different interpretations based on stress, and 2 possible meanings as to whether the man had a stick or a stick was or wasn’t used, to hit him with.  Applying the <u>concept</u> of entropy in this scenario, *finding meaning* in the sentence equates to the *<u>balancing</u> of <u>energy</u>* between two states.  But what is imbalanced that needs <u>balancing</u>?  The imbalance is one of <u>knowledge</u>, as the <u>information</u> provided by each interpretation is quite different, and that <u>information</u> might be important to know.  To get the answers, the <u>brain</u> as a built-in *intention-drive*, which is the <u>neurology</u> that makes one need to, or desire to find answers.  This is not a well-understood process, but it is being studied[^341].  The <u>brain</u>’s built-in intention-drive is wired specifically for the purpose of discerning significance and increasing <u>knowledge</u>, which it has learned is a critical competitive and survival skill.  Even when there is no actual <u>information</u> to discern, the <u>brain</u> can create significance.  I suspect that delusional disorders are somehow related to a hyperactive intention-drive.

[^341]:Kidd, C., & Hayden, B. Y. (2015). **The Psychology and Neuroscience of Curiosity**. *Neuron*, *88*(3), 449–460. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.09.010, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4635443/pdf/nihms722442.pdf

How does this cognitive wiring and processing <u>work</u>?   While the physiological details of the wiring are not known, it’s an educated guess that the intention-drive is a result of, and proportional to, the electrical charge in the ions that create neural signals.  One clue is to look at the processing involved.

Take the following sentence:

> I can’t untie that knot with one hand.

The meanings of words, their <u>order</u>, the context of who is speaking and where they are, along with many other details, come into play to turn that sentence into <u>structured</u> <u>information</u>, or <u>knowledge</u>, in our head.  It is our <u>brain</u>’s <u>language</u> processing ability that converts the often messy <u>structure</u> of words into meaningfulness.  Were <u>language</u> more <u>structured</u> we might say this sentence as:

> Not [I [Able [[[Make [Not [Tied]]] [That knot]] [With One Hand]]]]

Although we don’t speak this way, this is more or less how the <u>brain</u> re-patterns the <u>concepts</u> to discern meaning.

There is such a <u>language</u> which was developed to specifically optimize the transmissions of <u>concepts</u>.  It’s called *Ithkuil*[^63].  In Ithkuil, you can say “On the contrary, I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point”, in the following manner:

<center><img src='../Images/044-ithlang.png' style='width:30%'/></center>

[^63]: Quijada, John. **A Grammar of the Ithkuil Language**. John Quijada, 2011.

Another is *Ygyde*, for example:

<center><img src='../Images/ygyde.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

which translates to “Yesterday evening he did not see a green tree”

I doubt we’ll be adopting these any time soon, but they are still fascinating.  Given what we know about the parallels between <u>language</u>, <u>neurology</u>, and the <u>nature</u> of growth and <u>evolution</u>, such new languages may provide insight into the creation of <u>patterned</u> <u>information</u> systems (which includes reality), especially with regard to our own <u>neurology</u>.

Regardless of the <u>language</u>, they all depend on <u>semantics</u>, which is what makes any <u>language</u> <u>work</u>.  Semantics is also a <u>structure</u> that  the <u>brain</u>’s wiring can most easily process&hellip; which is why <u>language</u> is <u>structured</u> the way it is.

### Semantics

Semantics is the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning, but there are two kinds of meaning, according to the *Theory of Meaning*[^64].  The first kind is the more common <u>definition</u> of <u>semantics</u>.

[^64]: Speaks, Jeff. **“Theories of Meaning”**. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University, 27 June 2019,<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning>

> The description of possible languages or grammars as abstract semantic systems whereby symbols are associated with aspects of the world.  (a more objective view)

An example of this type of objective description might be the following bifurcating graph of a simple sentence.

<center><img src='../Images/symxbar.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

The second kind is more relevant (to us).

> The description of the psychological and sociological facts whereby a particular one of these abstract semantic systems is the one used by a person or population.  (contextual relevance)

The *semantic web* is the term used to apply semantic <u>concepts</u> to digital <u>information</u> in an attempt to define what <u>information</u> “is” in a manner that is <u>structured</u> so that computers can read <u>data</u> and know if it is <u>information</u> and, more importantly, why it is <u>information</u>.  It does this by creating a relationship between two things.

Take the example of the following sentence:

> “Bob is interested in the Mona Lisa.”

To a human, this is <u>information</u> because we know how to parse this sentence into meaning.  That is what learning to speak is all about.  To a computer, however, it is just a meaningless collection of 1s and 0s&hellip;specifically:

~010000100110111101100010001000000110100101110011001000000110100101101110011101000110010101110010011001010111001101110100011001010110010000100000011010010110111000100000011101000110100001100101001000000100110101101111011011100110000100100000010011000110100101110011011000010010111000001010~

If we break this sentence up into three parts and define each part in a way that software can understand, then a computer can attempt to find meaning in it.  For example, we can tell the computer that we have two *things*, “*Bob”* and “*Mona Lisa”*, and one *relationship*, “*is interested in”*.

With these three <u>data</u> points, three “<u>atoms</u>” of <u>data</u>, we have the simplest form of <u>information</u>, an <u>information</u> “molecule”, so to speak.  The “things” are the *objects*, and the “relationship” is the *predicate*.  Together they are called a *triplet*.  We may have some other triplets about Bob, such as, he is a person, he is a friend of Alice, etc., and we can bind these triplets together quite naturally.

<center><img src='../Images/045-046.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Predicates can be just about anything: “lives in”, “has a”, “enjoys”, etc.  Objects, however, are part of a much larger, more <u>structured</u> <u>hierarchies</u>, much like the holarchies described above.  Using predicates and objects we can now *graph* our sentence (above right).

How does a computer know what “*is interested in*” or what a “*person*” is? It doesn’t “know” the way you or I know, but it does know that a *person* is a type of *agent*, has a *<u>family</u> name*, a *first name* and that a person *knows things*.  So, as far as a computer is concerned, a person is just a data-set with a bunch of specific properties and relationships to other data-sets.[^65] These definitions and relationships are defined <u>hierarchically</u> into the “that which is” ontology maps.  

[^65]: Example of a “person” as defined by the semantic web: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Person>

There are thousands of these ontologies of definitions run by corporations, governments, individuals, schools, the military, etc., that cover an incredible array of <u>data</u> in areas of geography, <u>life</u> sciences, linguistics, media, social networking, <u>medicine</u>, catfish, diseases, road-maps, accommodations in Tuscany, etc., and they can all talk to each other by linking *triplets* together*.*[^66]

[^66]: McCrae, J. P. (n.d.). **The Linked Open Data Cloud**. <https://www.lod-cloud.net>

As you can imagine, a computer can create millions of connections between triplets with little <u>effort</u> and in a very short time.  With all these connections, we can ask the computer typical questions like “*How many romantic comedy Hollywood movies are directed by a person who is born in a city that has an average temperature above 15&deg;?*” Of course, social media companies, who have their own ontologies that they aggressively build from their user-base, can ask questions like “*Give me a list of all the boys who are eligible to vote in the next election, and who listen to Seattle grunge bands, are politically left-wing, and have friends and <u>family</u> that are politically progressive.*” More worrying are the queries of the near future, such as “*Tell me all the names of people that are likely to commit a crime in the next week.*” That may sound like paranoia about a dystopian future, but <u>AI</u> systems in China have an 80% success rate in predicting who is a criminal just by looking at them.  At Stanford University they have developed an <u>AI</u> system that has a 91% accuracy rate of determining if someone is gay or straight[^67], and that is just the beginning.

[^67]: Wang, Y., & Kosinski, M. (in press). **“Deep neural networks are more accurate than humans at detecting sexual orientation from facial images”**. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology; Newspaper article on this research: Levin, Sam. **“New AI Can Work out Whether You’re Gay or Straight from a Photograph”.** The Guardian, Guardian News and Media, 7 Sept. 2017, <http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/07/new-artificial-intelligence-can-tell-whether-youre-gay-or-straight-from-a-photograph>

Language is based on rules of <u>nature</u> and can be deconstructed into triplets, and we can see these same rules applied to both the physiology required to support <u>language</u>, and the <u>language</u> itself.  In fact, Stuart Hameroff, the American doctor and professor at the University of Arizona known for his studies relating <u>consciousness</u> and <u>quantum mechanics</u>, has directly mapped the formation of sentences onto the relationships of microtubules via *tubulin proteins*.

<center><img src='../Images/xbar.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

It is also quite fascinating, though not surprising, that this <u>information</u> encoding is the result of the bifurcated tree <u>structure</u> of tubulin proteins interacting with hexagonal <u>structures</u> called *Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent <u>protein</u> kinase II*, or *CaMKII*.  The significance of binary trees and hexagonal <u>structures</u> will become increasingly apparent as we go deeper into the mechanics of <u>awareness</u>.

<center><img src='../Images/CaMKII.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

## Supply Chain

Here is another real-world example of a current project that is being developed with economists, world leaders, and investors, that attempts to model the supply chain in a holistic manner in <u>order</u> to show how environmentally <u>sustainable</u> solutions can be more profitable than unsustainable solutions over the long term, and how small details along the chain can have global consequences.

The project started out with reams of <u>data</u> from every sector of the economy, every mode of transport and delivery, distribution, allocations, etc.  It was little more than a random pile of <u>data</u> in the form of spreadsheets, various databases, government and industry reports.  The researchers sifted through this <u>data</u> looking for <u>patterns</u>, relationships, and dependencies.  What eventually emerged were sets of <u>conceptual</u> “triplets” with their corresponding instances and the relationships and rules that existed between them.  The researchers had no <u>knowledge</u> of holarchies, yet what they developed was quite similar.

Here are some (somewhat simplified) graphs taken from this project that describes the relationship between *resources*, *location*, and *sector* using the instances of *water*, *Argentina*, and *agriculture*.

<center><img src='../Images/047-truevalue.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

When modeling all elements of the supply chain, they ended up with the following visual representation of the model, with each color representing one of the three <u>concepts</u> that define each context or level (image below).  The left image  shows the set of three circles that represent *resources &harr; location &harr; sector* level, with a real-world data-set of *water &harr; Argentina &harr; agriculture*.  Within one of the inner circles, such as *agriculture*, is <u>information</u> about *product &harr; production &harr; transport*, such as *tomatoes &harr; kilos/yr &harr; import/export*.  In the end, they were able to calculate the environmental, economic, and social impact that one potato had at every stage of its journey from a spud on an Argentine farm to the garbage bin at a restaurant in Paris.  It is not a coincidence that this <u>structure</u> is identical to the <u>structure</u> of the neural wiring that connects a *synapse*, or transmission point, to a *dendrite*, a reception point, in the <u>brain</u>.  

<center><img src='../Images/048-truevalue-tris.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

You can clearly see the triplet and holarchic design of this representation of the supply chain in the image above (left).  This would be expected if you considered a supply chain as a large-scale version of a living system.  The image on the right seems to confirm this, or at least suggest that the <u>brain</u> and the central nervous system is an organic living instance of a real-time supply chain of three levels of embedded interdependency.

## Law of Laws

Earlier, we used Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law of Motion as an example to show how one <u>law</u> has many contexts, but Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> is only one of the three <u>laws</u> of *Newton’s <u>laws</u> of Motion*.  These Laws are:

1.  Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external <u>force</u> acts on it.
2.  Force equals <u>mass</u> times acceleration.
3.  For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

These are not simply three isolated <u>laws</u>, but rather three attributes of a greater phenomenon that describes all matter.

<center><img src='../Images/049-laws-of-motion.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

*(Later we show why these <u>laws</u> should be in the <u>order</u> of \#3 first, followed by \#1 and then \#2).*

While Newton discovered these <u>laws</u> of physics in 1666, the principles behind them were well established as least as far back as 1494 when the Venetian magician, mathematician and, monk, Luca Pacioli invented double entry accounting, which is still the most common form of accounting used to this day.

How are they the same principles?

Pacioli’s underlying principle to his accounting system evolved from his metaphysical and <u>cosmological</u> view that everything comes from nothing, and reality is simply an imbalance of that nothing, therefore, the sum of all things must equal nothing.  To apply this to accounting, wherever there is a negative entry there must also be an equal and opposite positive entry. A \$10 reduction in the ”petty cash” account due to the purchase of paperclips automatically creates a \$10 increase in the value of “office supplies” account.  Totaling the sums of all the different accounts must therefore equal 0, otherwise the account is not <u>balanced</u>.

In other words: **For every transaction there is an equal and opposite transaction.**

That works for the *<u>balance</u>* part of the 3 <u>laws</u>, but what of *inertia* and *<u>force</u>*? Is *inertia* equivalent to cash-flow? Is *entropy* equivalent to depreciation or amortization?  Is *<u>force</u>* equivalent to income or revenue?  Playing around with applying Newton’s <u>laws</u> to finance is complicated, given the countless ways value is used and defined, but some of the results look very interesting.

There is no doubt that Newton was quite aware of Pacioli’s <u>work</u>, and given both were students of the mystical and arcane, they probably shared many of the same beliefs, so it is probably safe to say that Pacioli’s <u>ideas</u> had some effect on Newton’s theories.  How much, we can only speculate.

We can see this trinity of <u>concepts</u> in any <u>structured</u> system.  Here are some examples:

## Music

The relationship of music to trigrams is so profound that it deserves a book unto itself, and many have been written, so I will only share that entire theories of music are modeled on the trigram, such as the *Tonnetz* (German for *tone-network*) model, which is a <u>conceptual</u> lattice diagram representing tonal space first described by Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician and engineer, and one of the greatest thinkers of modern history, Leonhard Euler, in 1739.  Modern music theorists take it a step further; that of a 2-dimensional map of trigrams mapped to a spinning torus… wow!  *Note: This model of music is also referenced in chapter 12, “Predeterminism”.*

<center><img src='../Images/tonnetz.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

## Drama

Around 335 B.C., Aristotle described the dramatic <u>structure</u> of a story as having a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Eight hundred years later, the Roman grammarian Aelius Donatus expanded that to a three-part <u>structure</u> of the *protasis (introduction)*, *epitasis (main action)*, and *catastrophe (resolution - which, in those days, was inevitably catastrophic)*.  Finally, German playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag turned the three-part <u>structure</u> into a five-part <u>structure</u> with the *Freytag Pyramid*.

The Freytag Pyramid can easily be defined as a trigram (below right) showing the five-part <u>structure</u> of *incitement*, *rising actions (inflation)*, *climax*, *falling action (deflation)*, and *resolution*.  Leading up to these five parts is *exposition*, which describes the baseline of the story, the characters, set and setting, etc.  After the five parts, there is the *denouement*, or the returning to the baseline of the natural <u>order</u>.  It is easy to see how the Freytag Pyramid is the classic three-part <u>structure</u> of *incitement (beginning)*, *climax (middle)*, and *resolution (end)* with the additional dynamics of *inflation* and *deflation*.  While it is called a five-part <u>structure</u>, there is obviously the sixth part, that of the baseline, the condition before and after the action described by the five parts.

<center><img src='../Images/harrypotter-frietag.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This, like all info-trigrams, is self-similar, with the *ascending* and *descending* elements being more “<u>atomic</u>”, and the trigrams being more “molecular”.  The substance of a story is typically made of many “<u>molecules</u>”. While there may be many types of Freytag contexts, most stories are one of, or a mixture of, the following 6. The image above shows this in an analysis of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", by J. K. Rowling.

- **Ascending**: “Rags to riches” <img src="../Images/story-asc.png" style="height:12pt"/>
- **Descending**: “Riches to rags” <img src="../Images/story-desc.png" style="height:12pt"/>
- **Descending &rarr; Ascending**: “Man in a hole” <img src="../Images/story-desc-asc.png" style="height:12pt"/>
- **Ascending &rarr; Descending**: “Icarus”<img src="../Images/story-asc-desc.png" style="height:12pt"/>
- **Ascending &rarr; Descending &rarr; Ascending**: “Cinderella”<img src="../Images/story-asc-desc-asc.png" style="height:12pt"/>
- **Descending &rarr; Ascending &rarr; Descending**: “Oedipus”<img src="../Images/story-desc-asc-desc.png" style="height:12pt"/>



## Reduction

The overarching idea here is that every model can be described by a self-similar set of three axis.  This is not arbitrary, as we claim that any system can be reduced to, and described by, a collection of *<u>information</u> primitives* (triplets or trigrams).  From these essentially 2-dimensional *<u>information</u> primitives* (in that they can be described with only three points) we can build *<u>knowledge</u> primitives* that are tetrahedral in <u>concept</u>.

Furthermore, we hope to demonstrate that these three axis are essentially three different perspectives of one state.  An example of this is how <u>energy</u> (as <u>electricity</u>) is expressed in the context and <u>scope</u> of <u>subatomic particles</u> as three different properties of <u>volts</u>, ohms, and amps, forming a trigram, which are them capable of describing a 4<sup>th</sup> property of *power*, which then forms a tetrahedron. We go even further and claim that the 3+1 dimensions of our reality (X,Y, Z, + time), is itself the most fundamental expression of this same model.

 We will return to more in-depth examples after some exploration into these <u>concepts</u>.

## Info-atoms

If our premise is that the smallest element of <u>knowledge</u> must conform to the same <u>laws</u> as the smallest elements of form, <u>conceptually</u> speaking, then we need to show how these 2D models, such as the <u>holarchy</u>, fit into a not just a 3D model, but specifically tetrahedral <u>structures</u> that represent “<u>knowledge</u> <u>molecules</u>” with an ordered self-similar <u>hierarchy</u> where each <u>holon</u> is represented as a tetrahedron of <u>information</u>.

Our revised model of <u>hierarchical</u> tetrahedrons will surely look and act differently than a <u>holarchy</u>.  To avoid confusion, we’ll refer to these *tetrahedron <u>holons</u>* as *<u>tholons</u>* (for obvious reasons), and the <u>holarchy</u> of <u>tholons</u> as the *thologram*.

#### **Key 49:** Every <u>tholon</u> is an <u>archetype</u>.

We are working from the premise that everything that exists is a product of a stable <u>pattern</u> existing between different states.  The simplest <u>concept</u> of such a duality is that of *something* and *nothing*. Not much can be said about *nothing*, but as for *something,* we don’t need to imagine something that represents everything at once, which is not only beyond our ability, but as everything has yet to come into <u>existence</u> (or if it has, it has not yet come into our context), it is impossible.  On the contrary, we only need to imagine the simplest form of something, for example, a singular dot.  A simple dot on a blank page is a diagram of the model on which this reality, and all <u>knowledge</u>, is based.  This single dot is often called the *<u>singularity</u>*.  In the <u>cosmological</u> sense, the <u>singularity</u> is 

> The point in which all physical <u>laws</u> are indistinguishable from one another, where space and time are no longer interrelated realities, but merge indistinguishably and cease to have any independent meaning.

These singularities were predicted by Relativity and theoretically have **<u>zero</u> volume** and **infinite density** (and therefore infinite gravity), and was the source of the <u>Big Bang</u>.  It was this crazy idea that lead to the discovery of <u>black holes</u>.  

There is another significance to the <u>concept</u> of <u>singularity</u>, and that is the *technological <u>singularity</u>*.  This is the point in time when technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, i.e., technology has the ability to design and build itself, creating an exponential curve of advancement that results in a super-intelligence.  <u>Ray Kurzweil</u>, <u>Google</u>’s Director of Engineering, predicts this moment will happen in 2045.

For our purposes, we only need to consider that the <u>singularity</u> that created this universe is a 0-dimensional dot. This simplest of <u>concepts</u> can explain the <u>holarchy</u>, tetrahedrons, magic <u>crystals</u>, all the <u>laws</u> of physics and every form of <u>intelligence</u> in <u>existence</u>.  

### Geometry I

The most effective way to describe this process of emergence from a dot to everything in <u>existence</u> is with the <u>language</u> of geometry.

> Philosophy [<u>nature</u>] is written in that great book whichever is before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the <u>language</u> and grasp the symbols in which it is written.  The book is written in mathematical <u>language</u>, and the symbols are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.  **\~<u>Galileo</u> Galilee, 1564-1642**

> It is the glory of geometry that from so few principles, fetched from without, it is able to accomplish so much.  **\~Sir <u>Isaac Newton</u>**

> <u>Tao</u> generates the One.  The One generates the Two.  The Two generates the Three.  The Three generates all things.  **\~<u>Lao Tzu</u>, Dao De Ching**

<center><img src='../Images/050-dot-line-tri.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

We are taught that the progression from point to tetrahedron follows a very clear and simple path of *point → line → trigram → tetrahedron*.

From the <u>tholonic</u> perspective, this is a very incomplete description because it considers any point to be just like any other point, but they are not the same, as each point has very different attributes.  If we ignore those attributes, we are blind to what geometry can show us about so much more than shapes.  Order is the most significant difference between these points, which is described below.

<center><img src='../Images/first-dot.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

*(Unfortunately, if you are reading this on a black and white eBook reader, these color <u>patterns</u> are meaningless. See  [Appendix A, “About This Book”](#Appendix-A:-About-This-Book) to test the gray scale of the primary colors on your e-reader.)*

<img src='../Images/fig-c1.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>We start with a 0-dimensional dot represented by a blue dot in the middle of nothing *(**Fig. c1**)*.  Because it is 0 dimensions and surrounded by nothing, it only exists as a concept.  It has no form, no dimensions, no properties other than that it is a *concept* of a point that exists.  But where does it exist? It can’t be measured, seen, or interacted with in any way, so how can we say it even exists?  We can only say it exists because of the awareness of its existence.  The only difference between a void of nothingness and a void of nothingness with an imaginary point in it is the *idea* of an imaginary point in a void of nothingness.  Without the awareness of its existence, the void of nothingness would simply remain a void of nothingness.  This is our first duality, that of *nothingness* and the concept of *somethingness*, and also the first condition of imbalance.

<img src='../Images/fig-cx02.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>This next step requires some philosophical conjecture because we have to ask why/how does a 2<sup>nd</sup> (green), dot appear (***Fig. c2***).

If we accept the premise that everything that is created has the attributes of, and <u>limitations</u> of, whatever created it, then, the answer is clear and simple.  As this lone imaginary dot in the middle of infinite <u>nothingness</u> only exists as an <u>awareness</u> of the <u>concept</u> of a point in the middle of infinite <u>nothingness</u>, the one attribute this point *can* have is <u>awareness</u>, as that is what it was created from.  And what was this <u>awareness</u>?  We can only presume that it was the most fundamental form of <u>awareness</u>, that being the <u>awareness</u> of existing (which is not the same as the meta-awareness of being aware that one is aware).  Additionally, being the only <u>awareness</u> that exists, it is virtually *unlimited  <u>awareness</u>*, and possibly *infinite <u>awareness</u>* as well if we consider “infinite” to mean the totality of all.

There is one more, far less obvious attribute to consider as well, and that is *<u>intention</u>*, because the <u>awareness</u> that conceived of a point in <u>nothingness</u> had to have the <u>intention</u> to conceive of it.  So, our point in the middle of infinite <u>nothingness</u> has two attributes; Awareness and Intention.  The <u>nature</u> of that <u>intention</u> is addressed further on.

#### **Key 50:**  Awareness and Intention (A&I) is the source of <u>existence</u>.

We see this same concept, that of creation being the result of A&I, in the spiritual texts of every major belief system.  For example, in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic lore[^356], when God spoke to Moses, God was quite specific about its name and not only told Moses its name was “I Am (Who/Which/That) I Am” (<img src='../Images/iamthatiam.png' style='height:10px'/>) but also informed Moses that the voice he was hearing was but a messenger of “I AM” (<img src='../Images/iam.png' style='height:10px'/>), a messenger of the most fundamental form of Awareness.  

[^356]: Genesis 3.14 “And God said to Moses, ‘Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh,” *(‘Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh’ Meaning of Heb. uncertain; variously translated: “I Am That I Am”; “I Am Who I Am”; “I Will Be What I Will Be”; etc.)* ‘Thus shall you say to the Israelites, ‘Ehyeh’ *(‘Ehyeh’ meaning “I Am” or “I Will Be.”)* “sent me to you.’”, <img src='../Images/quote.png' style='height:15px'/>

Buddhists appear to have cut out the middle-man (or perhaps “middle-god”) as they do not have the <u>concept</u> of a divine being, but they do have the <u>concept</u> of a primal <u>awareness</u>, as suggested in the <u>Buddhist</u> proverb: *A person asked Buddha: Are you a God? Buddha's reply was No. Are you an Angel? No. Then what are you? I am awake.*  

We can also see the <u>concepts</u> of A&I in the context of physics.  Take the example of <u>energy</u>, <u>mass</u>, and light, as we briefly addressed earlier.  Light has no <u>mass</u>, and without <u>movement</u>, it also has no <u>energy</u> and only exists as the <u>concept</u> of a 0-dimensionless point.  Without <u>movement</u> there would be nothing to measure nor would it interact with anything.  This <u>conceptual</u> point, a result of *<u>awareness</u>*, only has properties when it moves (speed, <u>frequency</u>, amplitude), and this <u>movement</u> is an expression of *<u>intention</u>*, making light (or any form of <u>radiation</u>) a primal expression of A&I.  It also suggests that <u>awareness</u> may be the purest form of <u>energy</u>, but it is <u>intention</u> that makes it manifest through <u>movement</u>.  Awareness and Intention, being the only two properties of this non-existent dot, always exist as two aspects of the primal dot, and therefore always exist together, similar to an electromagnetic field in how the magnetic field can only exist if there is <u>movement</u> of charges (<u>intention</u>), while the electric field surrounds the charge whether moving or stationary (<u>awareness</u>).

This may sound like we’re teetering on the edge of mysticism, but this is not our goal.  We simply are following the most reasonable path that our ability to understand our reality allows.  The fact that it suggests that all of <u>existence</u> is a form of A&I is not mysticism, it is a hypothesis of reality.  Science is slowly beginning to consider that there might be a relationship between <u>awareness</u> and reality, but the <u>tholonic</u> position is that <u>awareness</u> is not only the fabric of reality, but that the <u>intention</u> of that <u>awareness</u> is the <u>energy</u> that drives all of creation and the only <u>energy</u> in <u>existence</u>.  Just as the term “electrical current” implies a magnetic component, the word “<u>awareness</u>”, as we use it here, implies an *<u>intention</u>* component, as Awareness and Intention always coexist.  There is no Awareness without Intention, nor Intention without Awareness.

<img src='../Images/awareness-triad-2.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>We have seen how mass is a form of energy, and how they both follow the same rules applicable to their context.  Because of this, we can speculate that mass and energy are two different instances of the same archetype of pure energy but instantiated within two different scopes or contexts.  We will take one step further and say that awareness itself is an instance of that same archetype but in an even “finer” context, i.e.  before there was mass, there was energy, and before there was energy there was A&I.  Were this the case, it would shed light on why and how awareness and intention is an integral part of reality, which could provide answers to the quantum mystery of how and why awareness itself is required for reality to exist.  We accept that reality is a result of the interaction between the 2 states of mass and energy, but what if there are 3 states; energy, mass, radiation, and awareness?  

It would be very convenient if <u>awareness</u>/<u>intention</u> was somehow mapable to one of the missing formulas in our hexagonal model of Newton’s 2nd, because then we could see that <u>mass</u>, <u>energy</u>, and <u>force</u> were connected to <u>awareness</u>/<u>intention</u>, suggesting that nothing can come into <u>existence</u> without <u>awareness</u>/<u>intention</u>.  We might then also be able to calculate the *field* and *<u>force</u>* of <u>awareness</u>.  To be clear, I am not claiming this is the case, just that it would be convenient if it was.

So, our first dot has the two attributes of A&I, and the <u>limitation</u> of 0-dimensions.  This dot, then, is itself a form of <u>awareness</u> and <u>intention</u>, and being so, there is now an <u>awareness</u> of *dotness*, not *its dotness*, just *dotness*, as that is all there is to be aware of, but it is an <u>awareness</u> of *dotness* with <u>intention</u>.  Just as the first dot is the effect of intentional <u>awareness</u>, that same intentional <u>awareness</u> in the newly created (blue) dot will be the cause of a new effect, a new <u>conceptual</u> (green) dot.  Perhaps this is what <u>Nietzsche</u> was referring to when he wrote in “Beyond Good and Evil”:

> And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.

The new dot, and all dots that will ever come into being, have the same qualities of <u>awareness</u> and <u>intention</u>, as that is what created it, so as soon as the first dot was created, a never-ending cause-effect chain reaction of dots creating dots was initiated, like a kind of <u>conceptual</u> <u>Big Bang</u>. With these first 2 <u>conceptual</u>, 0-dimensional dots, the first relationship was created&hellip; the line.

There are now 2 states of *dotness*, *this* A&I and *that* A&I.  This is the birth of the <u>concepts</u> “I” vs. “Other than I”, and “Me” vs. “You”.  Where before there could only exist unlimited A&I as there was nothing other than *dotness*, now there is A&I that is limited by, and defined by, A&I.  This results in 2 types of <u>awareness</u>; the *subjective*, which is the A&I of one’s <u>existence</u>, and which is infinite by <u>nature</u>, and the *objective*, the A&I of another’s <u>existence</u>, which is finite by <u>nature</u>. The <u>existence</u> of 2 dots creates the 2 instances of A&I, that which is infinite, and that which is finite.  Both of these states exist in each dot, so now there are 2 instances in 2 dots.  In this way, 1 dot creates 4 perspectives (remember this, as it will soon be a very significant detail).

<img src='../Images/fig-cx03.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>With the existence of another A&I, each dot now has a center of *its* A&I, with the *other* dot defining the limits of its A&I.  Where before there could only exist unlimited A&I as there was nothing other than *dotness*, now there is A&I that is limited by, and defined by, A&I.  Where these 2 instances of A&I meet, where *subjective* meets *objective*, where the *infinite* meets the *finite*, creates a pair of new (red) dots (***Fig. c3***), 2 new instances of A&I, each created from the merging of these polar opposites. 

At this stage we have all 3 types of dots; blue, green and red.  Each of these dots came into being due to a unique cause and each had a unique effect.

- <img src='../Images/dot-blue.png' style='width:0.23in'/> The 1<sup>st</sup> blue dot represents the initial or parent 0-dimensional dot that has no ability to create dimension and exists only as a concept of awareness.  This is the awareness that exists before self-awareness, as self-awareness can only exist when there is something other than itself to be aware of.  Self-awareness requires an “other” awareness, a duality of awareness.  This is the dot that defines the simplest form of existence as pure A&I. It is equivalent to the number 0 as it is the concept of nothing.

- <img src='../Images/dot-green.png' style='width:0.23in'/> The 2<sup>nd</sup> green dot represents the first-generation dot created by the blue dot.  This dot can add 1 dimension to 0-dimensions and defines separation and division, creating the conditions of subjective and objective, and consequently the idea of self-awareness as a result of a state of awareness/intention with respect to another state of awareness/intention. This is equivalent to the number 1, and by extension, all real numbers.

- <img src='../Images/dot-red.png' style='width:0.23in'/> The 3<sup>rd</sup> red dot represents where the blue dot and the green dot interact.  The 3<sup>rd</sup> dot is always created as a pair, one for each of the opposite states of blue dot-green dot interactions.  This dot can add 1 dimension to an existing 1-dimensional space and defines the concept of *scope* and *area* as a result of the *union*.  This is equivalent to 2-dimensional numbers, or complex numbers, such as <IMG src="../Images/math/337.svg" style="vertical-align:middle;height:10pt"/> .  Why is it related to imaginary numbers?  Because we have two real numbers, 0 and 1, that create two versions of a 3<sup>rd</sup> number, as represented by the 2 red dots. This 3<sup>rd</sup> number therefore needs two values to be fully expressed, which is also the case with any real number multiplied by an imaginary number, as in *2&times;√-1=**2i***,  (This might also be an argument why the blue dot’s value should be *i* rather than 0,  making the 3rd dot value *1&times;√-1=**1i***).

Our ever-expanding <u>conceptual</u> model, however, is imprisoned in the 2D world forever because even though it can make an infinite <u>number</u> of dots in the 2D plane, it cannot make a new dot that expands itself into the 3D plane.  Why can’t the same process that was used to create 2D from 1D be used to create 3D from 2D, by just creating another dot with another dimension?

The <u>reason</u> is as follows: There can only be 3 types of dots in the 2D world because that is the minimum <u>number</u> of dots required to define an area.  If we added a new 4<sup>th</sup> type of dot that was also constrained to the 2D world, whatever area it creates could be defined using 3 dots just as well, so, this 4<sup>th</sup> dot adds no new or unique <u>information</u> and is useless.  We need a completely new type of dot that is compatible with all 3 types of dots.

Not surprisingly, the trigrams have already given us the answer with the following two clues.  The 1<sup>st</sup> clue is that the creation of one trigram implies the creation of three additional trigrams, each one connected to each side of the center trigram.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> clue is that for each of these new trigrams another dot is created.  These 3 additional dots at the outer tip of the new trigrams are each of a different color.  As every trigram must be composed of 3 unique dots (R, G, and B), and as a new type of dot capable of creating a 3D tetrahedron from the trigrams would automatically create 3 new trigrams, whatever dot type this new dot is, it would have to act as a red dot to the blue-green pair of the original trigram, a blue dot to the green-red pair, and a green dot to the red-blue pair.

The RGB dot <img src='../Images/052-rgbdot.png' style='width:0.23in'/> , or what we’ll refer to as the *white dot* <img src='../Images/053-whitedot.png' style='width:0.233in'/>, represents the combination of all three primary dots.  This dot can add 1 dimension to 2-dimensions and defines volume as a result of the union of the 3 unique trigrams that extend from the center trigram.  Such a dot is created when the 3 outer trigrams fold until their points meet.  The folding occurs naturally because it represents the most balanced and efficient interaction between a set of four unique dots (R, G, B, W), and as energy will always travel the path of least resistance, thanks to entropy, folding would naturally occur as would the creation of a new dot.

<img src='../Images/fig-rgbwtatra-2.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/fig-rgbwtatra.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/>We now have a tetrahedron.



*Note: This same <u>concept</u> is also explained in a mathematical manner in the chapter “How Creation Works” in the book “The Tholonic I-Ching”, which examines the I-Ching from a <u>tholonic</u> perspective.*

*Technical note: The colors RGB were chosen to best demonstrate how the dots interact, and these colors are used to represent the properties of these dots throughout the book.  However, the more informative approach would be to have the 1<sup>st</sup> dot as blue, the 2<sup>nd</sup> dot as red, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> dot as yellow.  This is because the intersection of the blue and green radii combine to create yellow.  The practical problem with that is with each generation, new and unique colors are created, and I suspect that using this model would result in all colors being generated.  While this may be an excellent example of using colors as a visual representation, it fails miserably to show basic <u>patterns</u>, and attempts to do just that were a nightmare to manage.*

## Holons to Tholons

Let’s back up and apply some of the semantic <u>concepts</u> to the <u>holarchy</u> as it will shed more light on the <u>nature</u> of <u>information</u> and how a <u>holarchy</u> forms a network of trinities in the way these <u>holons</u> interact with one another.

We begin with a simple trigram.

According to the creators of the <u>holarchy</u> model, each <u>holon</u> has three functions:

-   **Contributes** (to the context it exists within)
-   **Negotiates** (with other peer contexts)
-   **Defines** (that which it provides context for, its creations)

These attributes hold up quite well when compared to our real-world example of a supply chain, as there is a <u>contributing</u> supply, a demanding market for that supply, and the <u>negotiations</u>, cooperation, and <u>competition</u> that connect the two.

Here is where we turn a <u>holon</u> into a <u>tholon</u>&hellip; by rearranging the <u>order</u>, while keeping all the relationships the same, and them presenting that <u>order</u> in a different format.

<center><img src='../Images/054-holonrel1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This is much more that a cosmetic change, for by changing the focus and the <u>pattern</u> we can see a lot more <u>information</u>.  For example, we naturally want to imagine how to connect these three attributes.  If we create connecting lines (demonstrated below) that are the colors of the point that create them, we get one perspective, and if we use colors that are the colors opposite the line, we get another perspective.  The more <u>tholonic</u> choice is to use the complementary colors, for a <u>number</u> of reasons, but the main <u>reason</u> is because this options creates complimentary or pairs, or pairs of opposites, and <u>nature</u>, reality, and <u>existence</u> are all based on opposing forces. 

<center><img src='../Images/054-holonrel2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

There is still a piece missing.  If we apply the holarchic model to the <u>archetype</u> <u>concepts</u> of *town*, *state*, and *country*,  the model shows the interactions between *state*/*country* and *town*/*state*, but shows no direction connection between *town*/*country*.  The <u>tholonic</u> model *does* show a direct connection (yellow line), however, if the <u>concept</u> of *state* is stable, then a new *state* will naturally appear across this connection simply because it can, and if it *can*, it *must*.  For example, the three towns (i.e. colonies) that existed near the Delaware Bay in the newly declared United States of America eventually became the State of Delaware, and the first state in the United States.

The <u>tholonic</u> model therefore creates a new instance of *state*, which means there are now two instances of *state*.  It may seem redundant to have two instances of *state*, but in fact, they are not the same.  The originating  <u>concept</u> of *state* is that of any social <u>structure</u> that exists between *country* and *town*, but a *state* that exists between *town* and *country* is specific to that *town* and *country*.  For example, the abstract <u>concepts</u> of *town*, *state*, and *country* may instantiate as *Woodstock, New York, USA*, or *Navarro, Buenos Aires, Argentina*, two radically different instances of the same *town/state/country* <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetype</u>.  But this is not the most important difference between these two *states*.  As described earlier, the blue/*Negotiated* point is the only point from which children can emerge, therefore, a new <u>negotiated</u> point must exist for there to be any instances.  That point, in this example, is the <u>negotiated</u> <u>balance</u> between *town* and *country*.  Specifically, a *state* is *Defined* (limited, constrained) by its *country* and *Contributes* (allows for creation of) its *towns*.  So, this new point of *state* between *town* and *country* would be a instance of the <u>concept</u> of a *state*, for example, the *state* of *California*.  Now, *California* is itself a <u>concept</u> that has within it it’s own California-based instances of economy, politics, culture, terrain, weather, etc.  Hence, the final model of a 2-dimensional <u>tholon</u> is:

<center><img src='../Images/tatom.png' style='width:20%'/></center>

Stress on 2-dimensional, as the 3-dimensional model is far more complex, which we get into later.

<center><img src='../Images/buffalo.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Before we continue, we have to clarify some points on vocabulary. Words can be confusing, and sentences even more so.  Take the grammatically correct sentence above which was invented by professor William J. Rapaport in 1972 to demonstrate the point:

What this sentence is trying to say is:

>  *Bison from Buffalo, New York who are intimidated by other bison in their community also happen to intimidate other bison in their community.*

The confusion comes from the fact that the word *buffalo* has a <u>number</u> of meanings: as an animal, a place in New York, and a synonym for bullying.  

In the English <u>language</u> there are <u>concepts</u> of the *progressive form* of a verb to indicate ongoing action, a *perfect form*  to indicate a completed action, and a *perfect progressive form* to indicate the transition between *progressive* and *perfect* (i.e., ongoing action that will be completed at some definite point).  All these forms also have *past*, *present* and *future* tenses as well.  Can *perfect* verbs also be nouns?  Yes, sorta, in some cases, as in the word *<u>balance</u>*.  While *<u>balance</u>* as a noun is defined as “A state of equilibrium”, that <u>definition</u> also applies to the *perfect* form of *<u>balance</u>* as a verb.   This is not the case with words like *run* or *drive*, as there is no *present* state to achieve, no final condition that driving or running results in, only a *past* state of *ran* or *drove*. In some cases, like in the word “perfect”, when pronounced *PER-fect* it is a noun, and when pronounced *per-FECT*  it’s a verb!  So let’s be very clear on how we are defining the word *<u>negotiate</u>*.  

First, understand that in this <u>hierarchy</u> of <u>energy</u>, everything is happening all the time, so when we refer to these energies we refer to them in the present (unless otherwise noted).  

**Negotiate**: This is the infinitive version of the word, and when used alone can refer to any tense or form of the <u>concept</u> depending on context; *<u>negotiate</u>*, *<u>negotiates</u>*, *<u>negotiating</u>*, *<u>negotiated</u>*, *negotiable*, etc.

**Negotiated**: This is a noun, and specifically refers to the **<u>sustainable</u> <u>balanced</u>** arrived at through *<u>negotiation</u>*.  

**Negotiating**: This is a verb, and refers to the interaction of the various forces at play which are interacting with each other in the process of establishing at **<u>sustainable</u> <u>balance</u>**, or *<u>negotiated</u>* state.

## The Thologram

The primary <u>reason</u> why the properties of <u>movement</u> and <u>energy</u> are the key points in a thologram rather than the instantiated elements, as in the <u>holarchy</u>, is because it is the properties of <u>movement</u> and <u>energy</u> that are consistent at every level of creation.  There may be millions of instances of different types of elements within the <u>holarchy</u>, from subatomic elements to universal elements, and everything in between, but the properties of <u>movement</u> and <u>energy</u> are always the same, even though they are expressed differently for each context.  Therefore, it is the properties of <u>movement</u> and <u>energy</u> that define the <u>structure</u> of the <u>hierarchy</u>, not the instances of elements.

To further illustrate this point, we can use the previous semantic example of “Alice *is a friend of* Bob”. The <u>tholonic</u> model looks at “*is a friend of*” as the energetic <u>force</u> that defines Alice and Bob, at least within this narrow context of *friendship*.  Without relationships Alice and Bob would not even exist, as relationships define every interaction at every level of <u>existence</u>.

Consider the triplet *Bob is a farmer that grows corn and eats meat*.  We can look at the relationship of the three objects (nouns) *Bob, corn, meat*, which would be relevant to Bob, or we can look at the relationship of the three predicates (verbs) *is a, grows, eats*, which applies to all autotrophs (animals that grow their own food, like Leaf Cutter and  Fijian <u>ants</u>, damselfish, yeti crabs, and <u>humans</u>).

These properties direct <u>energy</u>, <u>energy</u> has <u>movement</u>, and <u>movement</u> has direction.  In this example, the direction is clear, however, this direction could change under different circumstances as we’ll see later on.

The idea of modeling reality on the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> rather that the *things* themselves is not a new idea.  The *Reciprocal System theory* is built on the same premise and provides the best explanation of why we are using the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> in the relationships and not the contexts of where that <u>energy</u> is coming from or going to.

> The thesis of the Reciprocal System, however, is that the universe is not a universe of matter, but a universe of motion, one in which the basic reality is motion, and all entities - photons, particles, <u>atoms</u>, fields, forces, and all forms of <u>energy</u> - are merely manifestations of motion.[^68]

[^68]: “**Reciprocal Theory**” RationalWiki, <https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Reciprocal_Theory>.

Like every theory, it has its fans, but also its critics.  In any case, it applies perfectly here.

Newton’s Laws of Motion are similar in this regard, as the <u>laws</u> of motion describe the <u>energy</u> that relates to <u>mass</u>, not any particular instance of <u>mass</u>.  Because of this, we can show a direct relationship between these <u>tholonic</u> <u>concepts</u> and Newton’s <u>laws</u>:

- **Newton’s 1<sup>st</sup> <u>law</u> states** *“Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external <u>force</u> acts on it”.*

  This <u>law</u> introduces the <u>concept</u> of an instance of <u>mass</u>, putting it in the realm of the 2<sup>nd</sup> green dot, and its <u>limitations</u>.  Its inability to move or change without an external forcing acting upon it puts it in the <u>tholonic</u> realm of *Definition*.  The <u>concept</u> of *inertia* is defined here, being the restrictions on <u>mass</u>.

- **Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>law</u> states** *“Force equals <u>mass</u> times acceleration”.*

  *Force* is the result of time and space (acceleration and <u>mass</u>), so it is within the realm of the 3<sup>rd</sup> red dot, <u>scope</u> and area, and <u>tholonically</u> is within the realm of *Contribution*, as it creates a new <u>concept</u> that describes the most fundamental property of <u>energy</u>, that being the *<u>force</u>* of <u>movement</u>.

- **Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> <u>law</u> states** “*For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.*”

  This equates to *<u>balance</u>*. No <u>mass</u> or <u>energy</u> is defined here.  This <u>law</u> only describes the result of existing energies acting against each other, associating it with the 1<sup>st</sup> blue dot realm of *Negotiation*.  The <u>concept</u> of *<u>balance</u>* (which includes the <u>concept</u> of imbalance) is born of energies interacting with one another.

The <u>order</u> of the <u>laws</u> assigned by Newton shows the <u>concept</u> of *<u>balancing</u>* (verb) following the <u>concepts</u> of *Definition* (<u>mass</u>, inertia) and *Contribution* (*<u>force</u>*).  In the <u>tholonic</u> model, the *First Cause*, the top of the <u>hierarchy</u>, begins with a stable point of *Negotiated <u>balance</u>* (noun), from which *Definition* and *Contribution* emerge as the result of the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>.  For this <u>reason</u>, the <u>tholonic</u> <u>order</u> of Newton’s <u>laws</u> would be the following:

1. *For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction (Balance, Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> <u>law</u>)*

2. *Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external <u>force</u> acts on it.  (<u>Inertia</u>, Newton’s 1<sup>st</sup> <u>law</u>)*

3. *Force equals <u>mass</u> times acceleration (Force, Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>law</u>)*

#### **Key 51:** Relationships define the function and purpose of any instance

<img src='../Images/tatom_desc.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>Now that we have mapped the three properties of N, D, and C onto a trigram we can see and label a new class of attributes that are the result of these properties interacting with each other.  For example, what we would expect to see across the spectrums?

-   *Negotiation/Definition*: This is the spectrum of **<u>laws</u>, rules, limits, demand**, as nothing can exist without definitions, limits and rules, either imposed by <u>nature</u> or some other system, such as <u>society</u>.  In the context of human interactions (just to keep it simple and clear), this pretty much describes how we agree on <u>laws</u>, rules, and limits.  This also applies to the demand side of supply & demand, as the demand for something is the limiting factor with regard to its usability.
-   *Definition/Contribution*: This is the spectrum of **cooperation and/or conflict**. Here is where the two opposing <u>concepts</u>, restriction/expansion, low/high entropy, interact with one another.  How something is defined and what it instantiates as are two different things, and the path to expressing that <u>definition</u> requires integration with its environment or context, which can be cooperative or competitive.
-    *Contribution/Negotiation*: This is the spectrum of **<u>work</u>, enablement, service, supply**.  Society as an organism in its own right has certain needs that must be met to survive, and it is the responsibility of its members to address those needs.  This is also the supply side of supply and demand, as production is certainly a <u>contributing</u> factor, involves <u>work</u>, provides a service, and enables further growth.

This trigram of relationships are present in every instance of creation and will be expressed according to the context and <u>scope</u> of its instantiation.  In the context of <u>society</u>, we have *<u>laws</u>*, *service*, and *cooperation*, and in social theory, such as <u>Adam Smith</u>’s  *Theory of the Invisible Hand*[^75], which is predicated on the idea of cooperation based on voluntary exchange that benefits both parties as well as the <u>society</u>.  In another context, such as the <u>atomic</u> world, *<u>laws</u>* would refer to the limits that an <u>atom</u> must exist within.  *Cooperation/conflict* could describe how the <u>atom</u>’s negative and positive forces <u>work</u> with, and against, each other, or perhaps how <u>atoms</u> fuse (unify, as in nuclear fusion) and “fiss” (break apart, as in nuclear fission).  *Dedication* describes the aspects of an <u>atom</u> that enhances the ability or properties of its parent <u>tholon</u>, that being the realm from which it was created, which in the <u>tholonic</u> view would be the realm of <u>subatomic particles</u>, such as <u>electron</u> protons and neutrons.  How useful would <u>subatomic particles</u> be is there weren’t any <u>atoms</u>?

### Simple Instance

<img src='../Images/tatom_H.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>What would be the simplest instance of this trigram? The most simple would probably be an element that only contains a single positive (*Contribution* or *C*) charge and a single negative (*Definition, Limitation* or *D*) charge, which exactly describes the first instance of matter, hydrogen.  What is especially relevant is that it does *not* contain a neutron, which, from the tholonic perspective, it should not as the *Negotiated* state, being a 0-dimensional point, does not actually exist (other than as a concept).  Hydrogen with a neutron does exist, and it is called *deuterium*, but the fact that the most basic, fundamental, and abundant element in existence, and the element that all other elements are created from, does not, is certainly supportive of the tholonic model, at least in this case

On the biological level, this describes mitosis and meiosis, the process of <u>cell</u> duplication, or reproduction, where one <u>cell</u> gives rise to two genetically identical daughter cells.  

In the realm of philosophy, we have the Hegelian Dialectic of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.  In fact, for a <u>tholonic</u> <u>concept</u> to exist as a potentially viable and <u>sustainable</u> expression it must satisfy a form of the Hegelian Dialectic, in that it must support a thesis (D), antithesis (C), and synthesis (child N) that is a product of C and D.

<img src='../Images/3-water.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>One obvious instance of this model can be seen in chemistry in the balancing of pH, which is the measure of the electrical charge of hydrogen ions.  The more complex the life-form, the more it requires a balanced pH of 7, which is right in the middle of the two extremes of pH 0 (battery acid, negatively charged) and pH 14 (drain cleaner, positively charged).  This suggests that a balanced pH allows for more growth options and therefore evolution, and, of course, we know this as water is a pH of 7, and most life depends on it.   When combined, acids and alkalies “negotiate” with each other in the form of interactions, competing and cooperating on an atomic level to find a stable negotiated balance, like our previous table salt and water example.  

Another instance is in the way genetic traits are combined and passed from the two sides of the tree.  

There are countless instances of <u>nature</u> and reality following this most fundamental of all <u>patterns</u>.

We can speculate a <u>number</u> of things from this trigram, but the one detail that is important before moving on is that the initial 0-dimensional blue dot, or what we will call the *N-point*, is the originating point, and the only point that is able to replicate itself.  Why this is so will be explained shortly.  We will refer to the blue-dot *N-point* as an *N-state* when it is in a state of <u>negotiation</u> (verb) , or an *N-source* when it is in a <u>balanced</u> <u>negotiated</u> state (noun), depending on context.  An *N-point* can be either an *N-state* or a *N-source*.  While an *N-point* is actually both of these it acts as one or the other depending who whether it is acting as a creation of a *<u>holon</u>* (*N-state*) or the progenitor of a *<u>parton</u>* (*N-source*). An *N-state* has a dimensional form and a contextual instance, while an *N-source* is a 0-dimensional <u>concept</u>.  This is similar in how a physical printing press is an *N-state*, but the <u>ideas</u> that printing press creates, such as printing a book, is an *N-source*.  One that book is printed, it is in an *N-state*, but <u>concepts</u> that stem from that book are *N-sources*, e.g., the Bible or the Communist Manifesto, and hopefully, this book.

### House of Mirrors

The tholographic claim is that within the trigram there is <u>energy</u>, and therefore <u>movement</u>, and therefore <u>patterns</u> and oscillations from which stable states will arise that are <u>sustainable</u> enough to form a new N-source that is capable of transferring <u>energy</u> across the <u>scope</u> defined by C and D.  Even though one particular state will exist at one specific point on the 1-dimensional spectrum/line between C and D, all possible states will cover the entire range between C and D.  We can generally guess where along the line various states will arise by applying a <u>Bell curve</u> to this line.

<img src='../Images/059-ruleexposure-8.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>The image on the right shows a Bell curve within the trigram to show where along the CD spectrum stable instances will most likely occur.  Also important to remember is that the (yellow) line opposite the top (blue) N-source is the field of interactions between the C and D creations of the N-source, and where a new N-state will form which will potentially become a new N-source when it become stable enough to generate new patterns of its own.

We can now describe one creative aspect of a <u>tholonic</u> trigram and its properties a bit more clearly (hopefully):

-   **N** (negotiation) equates to the 1<sup>st</sup> blue dot <img src='../Images/dot-blue.png' style='width:20px'/>, which is the awareness of a concept in its simplest form.
-   **D** (definition) equates to the 2<sup>nd</sup> green dot <img src='../Images/dot-green.png' style='width:20px'/>, which introduces limitation, division, and separation.
-   **C** (contribution) equates to the 3<sup>rd</sup> red dot <img src='../Images/dot-red.png' style='width:20px'/>, which, with the previous two dots, results in unification and form.

By these descriptions, we can describe a general process that defines creation as something like:

> The cooperative or conflicted merging of contrasting <u>concepts</u> that finds a <u>balanced</u> (Negotiated) expression in form (Contribution) through <u>limitation</u>, division, and separation (Definition).

At the most abstract levels, this describes the <u>Big Bang</u> Theory, biological reproduction, the <u>laws</u> of physics, philosophy, and anything else that exists in any sort of duality.
