# Part III
~~Part I of this book introduces the ideas and concepts that form the vocabulary later used to describe the tholonic model presented.  These are not esoteric or niche concepts, but the most fundamental concepts known to science, such as energy, chaos, order, waves, and Newton’s Laws.  As we review these basic concepts, we also expand on them and build new concepts that will be critical in describing what role awareness plays in the theater of existence, how and why consciousness *had* to evolve, and the nature of intelligence; artificial, human, or otherwise.~~

# 11: APPLICATION OF AWARENESS

###### Experiments in Awareness

## Mythology

It may seem odd that *mythology* would be placed in the chapter of how awareness is/can be applied in the real world, but beliefs of any sort are excellent examples of the application of awareness.  Beliefs are perhaps the most common way to channel awareness as they can cohere the otherwise undirected and unrestrained awareness.  In this way, beliefs act like the point of *Definition* in the tholonic trinity, putting restrictions on how that awareness is expressed.  Considering this, it is no wonder that mythologies so closely reflected the archetypes of creation.  From the tholonic view, it was/is the intelligence of these archetypes that vie for that awareness within the arena of human consciousness. Mythologies and beliefs are the earliest form of Man's *conscious will* to have a hand in the creation of his reality.

It may sound childish or even superstitious to suggest that archetypes can have intentions that can result in conflicting and/or cooperative relationships, which implies allies and enemies, and therefore some sort of diplomacy and politics.  In one sense it is childish, in that it leaves so much open to the imagination. In another sense it is childish because beliefs in general are an early form of learning how to use the power of awareness.  Beliefs are the Legos of awareness.  Beliefs are also placeholders that fill in the blanks of our limited understanding of the mechanics of awareness, intention, and intelligence, which is also why they have such a significant effect on our understanding of reality.  

The ancient myths provided a pretty effective way to understand the workings of reality, given the context and scope of our abilities when they were created.  We see these gods and their unending dramas as anthropomorphized concepts of tholonic intelligences and their interactions. As previously stated, tholonic archetypes, like the gods themselves, are autonomous agents in a self-reproducing system.  To get a general idea of the Mexican-soap-opera-of-psychopaths-on-steroids that was the life of the Gods, see *Appendix D*, “*Greek Gods*”  It is short, and quite entertaining.

These two charts compare the hierarchy of the Greek Gods (according to Gaius Julius Hyginus, a scholar born in 64 B.C.) and the same hierarchy of one of many archetypes represented by that deity.

## Sensing Intention

The idea that plants, and presumably other life forms, are sensitive to the feelings and intentions of others within their sphere of influence is not a new idea.  There still exists debate as to  the validity of the *Backster Effect*[^300],(which was evidence that supports the hypothesis that plants not only respond to physical and chemical stimuli, but that they are capable of knowing the emotions and thoughts of entities around them), and similar popular ideas, such as those in the book *The Secret Life of Plants*, but at the very least, this is an area worthy of more investigation.  The tholonic view is that everything that exists is part of a *Vast Active Living Intelligence System* (to borrow the title of a book by author Phillip K. Dick) that we are calling the Thologram, and consequently, everything *must* be connected to everything else in some way and form.  As our knowledge and our ability to share that knowledge expands, our understanding of reality so too will expand, and in many different directions.  Multiple theories, philosophies, practices, will not only emerge, but each will have their own body of evidence supporting that model. Some will flourish and others will wither away. This is the evolution of perspective.  

Similar to the "Can you prove Australia exists?" problem, at some point we need to choose what or who to *believe* as true or not. While the Backster Effect is soundly grounded in tholonic principles, that alone is not enough to accept it as real.  Perhaps the most convincing support comes from one of the more ingenious scientists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Marcel Vogel.    

Marcel Vogel  (1917 - 1991) was a research scientist for IBM’s San Jose facility for 27 years and was granted a number of patents, from hard-disk magnetic coatings to egg testing.  At age six he was pronounced dead from double lobar pneumonia. He claimed that while he was “dead” he experienced a light and a sense of love and well being that was overwhelming, and this formed the underlying fabric of his life and beliefs. 

With the aid of IBM's state-of-the-art equipment, he replicated the Backster Effect.  Below is the polygraph results that he said made him a “believer”.

<img src='../Images/Cleve_Backster_2.png' style='width:100%'/>

Vogel even lectured at IBM on the subject of "Do Plant Have Emotions?", which, in 1969, was a radical concept.  He experimented with plants for some time and discovered a number of very odd and “unscientific” facts.  For example; 

- It was observed that when he released his breath slowly there was virtually no response from the plant, but when he pulsed his breath through the nostrils, as he held a thought in mind, the plant would respond dramatically. 
- The plant's response was the same regardless of distance, as the results were the same when he was in San Jose (where his lab and the plant were), or in Prague, Czechoslovakia.  This also suggests that coherent thought acts similarly to coherent energy in that it can travel over long distanced without loosing power.  
- Plants appeared to respond more to the threat of damage than to the actual damage itself.
- Plants appeared to have many of the same properties as batteries, especially when it came to their interactions with thoughts.
- It was observed that the attitude, or mind-set, of the experimenter had a measurable effect upon the test-results.  This might shed some light on the inconsistent result of the “water memory” experiments of Jacques Benveniste, as related previously.
- He concluded from these experiments that he “learned that there is energy connected with thought. Thought can be pulsed and the energy connected with it becomes coherent and has a laser-like power.”

Because of his young near-death-experience, Marcel believed that the greatest cohering agent is love.  This may be correct.  The tholonic view is that *intention* is the basis of reality and creation, but says nothing about what that intention *is*.  The tholonic position is that *any* intention is equally valid.  However, it's reasonable to imagine that some intentions are more effective than others, and it is reasonable that the intention of love may be the most sustainable.

Such ideas did not endear him to the scientific community, but this discovery opened many new doors of investigation for Marcel, especially in the areas of crystals and water, with some very impressive (anecdotal) results.  Needless to say, this not only set him apart from his fellow scientists, but ensured his obscurity.

## Maharishi Effect

Given the general direction of mainstream science, we do not see a lot of investigation into how thought affects external reality, but some do exist *(see items 3 and 4 in "Other Experiments" list below)*.  We will look at one research report here, *“Effects of Group Practice of the Transcendental Meditation Program on Preventing Violent Crime in Washington, D. C.: Results of the National Demonstration Project, June-July 1993”*[^160] published in the journal *“Social Indicators Research.”*

This study, which was monitored by a 27-member project review board comprised of independent scientists and leading citizens, found that there was a significant statistical result.

What was this study exactly?

> This study presents the final results of a two-month prospective experiment to reduce violent crime in Washington, DC.  On the basis of previous research, it was hypothesized that the level of violent crime in the District of Columbia would drop significantly with the creation of a large group of participants in the Transcendental Meditation® and TM-Siddhi® programs to increase coherence and reduce stress in the District.[^161]

Here, the word “coherence” refers to its definition of “*the quality of forming a unified whole*.”

<img src='../Images/medchart.png' style='FLOAT:RIGHT;width:40%'/>The results were impressive.

This is only one study, so it is not definitive, but it is certainly supportive of the idea that directed intention, what the participants called *coherence*, and what we are calling *order* (as that is what unifies the parts into the whole), has an extended effect.  The explanation, according to the tholonic model, is that the directed energy of coherent thought altered the curves of various archetypes thereby altering the probability of where the “work” will produce the most order, or where and how energy will be expressed across a scope’s spectrum.

### On a Personal Note

I had a particularly insightful experience with the Maharishi Effect back in the late ’60s when I was a young teenager.  My father was a captain of industry in the world of electrical components, ultimately becoming president of one of the pioneering companies that helped create the first integrated circuit.

Born of poor Scottish immigrants in the Bronx on the tail of the Great Depression, and serving in Korea, he was no stranger to hard times and hard work, which made him one of the most pragmatic and practical people I have ever known.  He was a devout capitalist, atheist, and husband, and had no patience for anything that did not produce results.  Hippies were idiots, imports were ruining the economy, Scotch whiskey was better, and talking about your problems was for whiners.  You get the picture.

At the insistence of his wife (and my mother), he joined her for a seminar on *Creative Intelligence (CI)*, which was what they called Transcendental Meditation back then for those folks like my father.  He heard their claims about improved mental and physical health, better focus, fewer distractions, etc.  He decided to test their claims by giving all his employees in one of his factories CI training, along with an extra half-hour at lunch break for them to take this training and practice their new CI skills.

This factory was in a poor, rundown industrial town in New England, and the people that worked in those factories were uneducated, unskilled, assembly-line laborers - not exactly an open-minded demographic.  I knew a number of them myself, as we lived in that town, and many never made it past 4<sup>th</sup> grade.  The rivers in this town were dead from all the pollution, and the neighboring town had the highest *per capita* suicide rate in the United States.  It was a dreary, dark place filled with dreary, dark people.

His peers in the industry thought he was being foolish to deploy such a plan, but the results were astounding.  People were fighting less, taking less sick leave, injuries were down, production went up; in general, everything improved.  So much so, that the Wall Street Journal did an article on him and his “revolutionary” new technique.  He became known as some kind of New Age Industrialist, which was ironically funny as he was as new age as his ’57 Chevy.

Ultimately, this new concept was unsustainable in that environment because eventually people began to abuse the extra time meant for CI, and everything went back to *normal* with sick leaves, fighting, injuries, and lower production, so the program was scrapped.

## Prayer

You might be thinking that traditional prayer holds the same power, but it does not.  Why? Because most prayer is anything but coherent.  Prayer means very different things depending on culture, religion, personal perspectives, etc.  Perhaps this is a side-effect of monotheism, which eliminated the myriad of niche gods.  In any case, prayer can be anything from begging to demanding, justifying to virtue signaling, and occasionally it can be an expression of gratitude and love, but using group prayer to effect change is like using a group of blind people to paint a room by throwing handfuls of paint at the wall.  Your room *will* get painted, but you’ll wish it didn’t.

This was recently confirmed by a &dollar;2.3-million-dollar study on the effect of prayer on the sick, involving over 1,800 patients.  It was the largest study of its kind ever undertaken.  Contrary to prayer helping the sick, they found that when a patient knew others were praying for them, they tended to have *more* complications.[^162]

There are other studies that conclude the exact opposite, such as Dr.  Byrd’s study “*Positive Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer in a Coronary Care Unit Population*”[^163] and Dr.  Harris’s  study “*A Randomized, Controlled Trial of the Effects of Remote, Intercessory Prayer on Outcomes in Patients Admitted to the Coronary Care Unit*”[^164].  However, without a detailed comparison of the studies, and specifically the manner in which the participants prayed, we cannot know to what degree coherence was at play.

The difference between the coherence of Transcendental Meditation and prayer is the former follows a very specific set of rules, has a beginning, a middle and an end, has a clearly defined non-personal target subject, and never attempts to force change.  Prayer can follow these same rules, but it rarely does because there are no rules to prayer and varies greatly depending on culture, tradition, perspective, intention, etc.

The practice of *coherent prayer* is common among metaphysical secret societies.  For example, in the not-so-secret secret society of the *Order of the Rosy Cross*, or *Rosicrucians*,  members who have reached a certain level of initiation are introduced to a schedule of “prayers”. This is a globally synchronized schedule of times when people are requested to focus their energy on a particular topic, such as health or family or finances, and in a specific manner.  If one is not in need, they send their gratitude into a “pool” of energy specific to that topic.  If one has a need in these areas they can join in at the scheduled times and “tap into” that pool.  This is a very coherent technique because it has specific archetypes and directed energy, which then creates sustainable patterns, and it (reportedly) works surprisingly well.

The effect of the *Consciousness Field*, as it is referred to by Roger Nelson of Princeton University and director of *The Global Consciousness Project*, is not limited to humans, but can affect matter and machines *(see first two items listed below under “Other Experiments”).*

## Thought

If we are looking at meditation, prayer, and other forms of coherent thought, we have to also look at the concept of entropy because coherence is *lower* in entropy than incoherence, just as a laser light is lower in entropy that normal diffuse light.  This suggests that the act of meditation, prayer, concentration, focus, and even attention in general, creates a lower entropy state from a higher entropy state, which is a blatant violation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Law of Thermodynamics!  While it was shown that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Law is not really a law but a statistical probability, the probability of breaking that law is supposed to be extremely unlikely, but here we see we can break that law whenever we like under almost any conditions.

From a thermodynamic perspective, focus, concentration, prayer, etc., only uses 0.65 calories an hour, at most, which means a single chocolate chip cookie could power a year’s worth of meditation if one meditated 20 minutes a day, and yet focused thinking is what accounts for pretty much everything mankind has created since he thought ”hmm… sharp stone… long stick… what if?” 500,000 years ago.  This is a similar argument to the question “How can a system become more organized (i.e. evolution) in an ever increasingly chaotic system (i.e., reality)?”.  This argument is called the *Schrödinger paradox*, as it was introduced to the world by Erwin Schrödinger in 1933 in his book “What is Life?”.  But, Schrödinger had the answer (So, I guess it’s more of a rhetorical question, despite it being called a paradox), and goes something like the following paragraph.

The 2<sup>nd</sup> Law only applies to *closed* systems, where no energy can enter or leave.  Life, at least on Earth, is an *open* system, as we get lots of energy from the sun, and our solar system is an open system as it gets energy from the galaxy.  In practical terms , the Universe as a whole is the only closed system (that we know of) in nature.  So, the evolution and self-organizing of life *appears* to break the 2<sup>nd</sup> Law, but doesn’t *really* because it’s getting more energy from the sun that it expends evolving and self-organizing.   Scientists refer to this external energy as *free-energy*. 

Does this mean that a system can self-organize as long as the resulting increase in local entropy is less than the free-energy it receives?  And even if that were so, why *would* it self-organize in the first place? 

~~In the old days, when there was plenty of blobs of carbon-based bio-goo, but before life existed, the bio-goo blobs were getting a lot of this free-energy.  According to the laws of energy, they needed to expend the same amount of energy they took in, but carbon-based blobs have no special energy-dissipation abilities, at least not as blobs.  As energy moves through the blobs, the blobs will naturally reorganize to allow for the movement of energy, and as the blobs can only absorb so much energy, excess energy will naturally dissipate.  This movement of energy within the blobs formed patterns, and these patterns became what we have come to know as life.  This is (perhaps) why the earliest forms of life are believed to be 4+ billion year old microorganisms that formed on the hydro-thermal vents on the ocean floor that spew out boiling hot water in .  That heat was their source of free-energy, and it delivered significantly more energy than the sun.  The earliest direct evidence of life are the 3.5 billion-year-old microfossels found on  the hot water vents in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.~~

~~According to Jeremy England, a 31-year-old assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who derived a mathematical formula[374]that explains how the movement of energy can convert a carbon-based blob into a life form:~~

>  ~~You start with a random clump of atoms, and if you shine light on it for long enough, it should not be so surprising that you get a plant.~~

~~We see this also in non-carbon blobs, for example, self-assembling crystals and quasi-crystals.~~

Now, the idea that coherent thought appears to violate the 2<sup>nd</sup> Law makes more sense if we accept that consciousness is an open system receiving free-energy from the Source Awareness and Intention (SAI), and while consciousness is a contextual instance of SAI, we can also understand it as the result of the need to dissipate the free-energy of the SAI we are exposed to, just as the carbon-based blobs were exposed to energy.  Still, if the answer was that simple, it would not explain why the willful act of thinking, or even the instinctual act of focusing attention, could so easily decrease entropy (less dissipation) when the goal of energy would be to increase dissipation (more entropy).

Incoherence is nature’s first choice when it comes to the distribution and balancing of energy, but we can find examples of coherent transmissions of energy as well, mainly between molecules involved with photosynthesis, microtubules, quantum energy transfer, and possibly mitochondria, bacteria, and  plant chloroplasts (part of plant cell that converts light into chemical energy).  This natural coherence is more common  to the micro-world, and is also of very short duration, but it exists because it is a far more efficient way to transfer a specific amount of energy to a specific target.  Just as the energy emissions of the blob required a more organized, more structured, more coherent pattern to efficiently move energy, molecular and quantum processes also require a more coherent and efficient form of energy transfer for the same reason.  The difference between the two instances is the nature of the energy; heat vs. light.

If we accept this new theory of life, then we also have to accept that the evolution of life, which includes DNA information storage and retrieval systems, is also a by-product of, and for, the movement of energy, and that sounds like a pretty big leap.  However, self-assembling crystals and quasi-crystals exist and are the subject of much research.  DNA self-assembles in the same manner, and many self-assembling quasi-crystals *are* DNA.  if we consider that the primary function of anything that exists is to remain in existence, to maintain a stable pattern of energy within the context of its existence, then these once carbon-based blogs would first need to create a synergetic relationship with its surrounding; i.e., it will need to consume or assimilate resources and contribute something of equal or more value back to its context or environment.

Schrödinger also observed that: 

> An organism's astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos - of 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environment - seems to be connected with the presence of the 'aperiodic solids', the chromosome molecules, which doubtless represent the highest degree of well-ordered atomic association we know of - much higher than the ordinary periodic crystal …

In other words, the ability for living organisms to increase coherence, reduce dispersion, (i.e., reduce entropy) seems to be connected with the meta-crystals of DNA (i.e. information).

It is the DNA of life forms that determines how it will manage not only the sustainability of an organism, but also the transmission of energy, especially *free-energy*, and as all the organs, including the brain, come into existence and grow in accordance with the rules recorded in the DNA, we can say that the entire organism and its parts exist because of DNA and are design to optimize existing energy and dissipate excess energy.

If we are constantly being “energized” or “irradiated” by the omnipresence of SAI, how are we dissipating all the excess “energy” we are exposed to?  Through increasingly complex systems of dissipation, such as consciousness, meta-consciousness, and the systems they “self-assemble”. “self-assemble” is in quotes because from a Universal perspective, everything that did, does or will exist is self-assembled.

As pattern and order become more complex, interconnected, and efficient, coherent exchange of energy will become more common.  Rain is a very efficient way to distribute water, and in the past, humans would hope for rain to water the plants that they foraged.  Coherent attempts were made to invoke the rain, such as praying, dancing, and sacrificing, and while there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this technique, humans eventually discovered a far more coherent and efficient technique that resulted in far more efficient production;  plumbing and irrigation, because coherently managed and directed water does better job of growing plants than unmanageable, unpredictable rain. (*Note: This is not an endorsement or modern irrigation techniques which can be irresponsible and environmentally damaging.  This is just a comparison of coherent vs incoherent systems*).

We are partons to a larger tholon. It is our ability to transfer coherent energy, with technology and with thought, that makes us part of the energy distribution system of that larger system, but more than that, we are that part of this larger systems because of the movement of energy in that larger system has evolved to the point where it needs to produce coherent distribution of energy, and as energy is Awareness and Intentions, that translates to “the intentional directing of consciousness”.

## Structured Water

Given how water seems to be such a good tholonic medium, can we add structure to water in a way that matches and/or enhances the patterns of the thologram and see some differences in how it transmits or interacts with energy? If we do see any differences, then we have another piece of potential evidence that supports the tholonic model.

As it happens, there is such a thing as *structured water*.  *Coherent* or *Structured* water, for those who are not familiar with the term, is regular water that has been modified to give it more structure or pattern, specifically in the way that the water molecules are arranged in relation to one another, or so it is claimed.

OK, I know I probably lost some of the readers with this last sentence.  If you do an Internet search of “structured water” one of the first results you will get is the Wikipedia entry that begins with “structured water is a term used in a marketing scam” and although that is true to the extent that anything can be a scam in the hands of scammers, the entry says nothing whatsoever on the research and testing that has been done regarding the use of structured water.

To the dogmatically skeptical, anything that challenges the current world view is “swarming with worms of heretical perversity”. It doesn’t matter if a new idea, in this case, structured water, has vast amounts of scientific research and support from highly accredited professionals and ample evidence one can find by researching the pioneers and leaders in the field, many with a lifetime of contributions and dozens of Chairs, Fellows, and Adjuncts with Accolades of their life’s work[^78], as well as hundreds of papers and dozens of books related to and supporting the structured water phenomena.  Skepticism has its place and serves a critical purpose, but regarding the extreme skepticism of structured water, that purpose does not seem to be moving understanding forward or seeking new solutions to real-world problems, such as solving global water shortage problems and increasing crop production, as has been well documented by some of Australia’s largest produce farms.

To see the result of my own tests and how to make structured water, see *Appendix J: Structured Water*.

[^78]: <http://hexagonalwater.com>

There is quite a lot of good research on the subject that we won’t detail here, but if you want to learn more a good place to start is Fabian Ptok’s Masters theses *“Alternative Irrigation Methods: Structured Water in the context of a Growing Global Food Crisis due to Water Shortages”*[^79], which covers the subject well from an agricultural and security perspective but also has a number of references to the researchers and work going on in this area.  One of the often cited studies showed dramatic results in decreasing blood and DNA damage in diabetic rats, but this study is also criticized as it was small[^303] . There is also a book by Professor Gerald Pollack, who has an impressive list of credentials[^304], and is available online for free[^80] (which I have not read, so this is not an endorsement or recommendation).  Another good source is the work of Marcel Vogel (more on him later) who claimed that through years of work and thousands of experiments he was able to prove that various forms of energy, including thought, could permanently change the spectrographic properties of water, [^301] and that water was an information storage system.  This last claim is especially significant considering Vogel was not only a chemical and physics researcher at IBM for 27 years, but he was an information medium specialist, holding patents of hard-drive memory technologies that are in use to this day.

<img src="../Images/116-water-ice.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>Water is a particularly good test medium because the structure of molecular water is tetrahedral, and being the most basic shape of creation lends itself to many different tholonic applications.  It’s worth noting that when it was originally suggested that water might be tetrahedral in shape back in 1938 the idea was met with disbelief.  It was not until 80 years later, in 2013, that this was finally accepted as valid.  Today “it is widely accepted that liquid water structure is comprised of two closely interweaved components; i.e.  tetrahedral and hexagonal structures”.[^81]In fact, water, as ice, may be the closest instance of the entire tholonic structure of any other substance (that is common to us). *(Left image from “Tetrahedrality is key to the uniqueness of water”[^82])*

The *silicate structures* of minerals are also quiet similar in that they are made up of tetrahedrons of various arrangements.  In fact, the structure of water and quartz is so close that in some conditions ice has the same (or really similar) structure as quartz! [^302]This lends some credence to the metaphysical idea that water and quartz have a special relationship.

Radical ideas are often met with radical resistance.  Structured water is one of those ideas, and it falls into the same New Age category as “crystal power”.   Ignoring the 249D crystal that (possibly) created reality, common crystals do have some pretty impressive qualities.  

- Generate electricity (piezoelectric).

- Amplify, transmit, and store data (up to 300 million years [^342]).

- Generate signals (used in microchips, watches, internet routers and network controllers, satellites, up to billions of cycles per seconds).

- Control the transmission and phase of of light (liquid crystal displays - LCDs, )

- Ability to alter time (yes! they are called *time crystals*, and they represent a new state of matter, according to MIT.[^343]

- Ability to hold a magnetic charge.

The reason crystals can do all these amazing things is because of the structure of the elements that make a crystal, and water, with its tetrahedral structure, is like a form of liquid crystal.  As we have stated, energy creates order, and movement is the effect of energy, therefore, adding energy via movement to a tetrahedral liquid, such as water, will  have some positive or reinforcing effect on its structure, and that structure, being a more efficient conduit for transferring energy, will likewise have an effect on that which interacts with it by transferring more energy.I believe 


The hypothesis is then, simply by causing movement to commercial water (tap or bottled) we should see measurable effects.

In Ptok’s Master’s thesis mentioned above, the author examines various tests that grew different plants using tap water and structured water.

<center><img src='../Images/095-ptolks-images.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One of his findings was that using structured water increased alfalfa growth by 15.1%.  This may not sound like much, but in the U.S. alone a 15% increase in alfalfa growth represents an additional 20,700,000 tons of alfalfa, which has a value of over 4 billion dollars.

Similarly, some of Australia’s largest produce farms have reported needing 25% less water to produce a superior product than with traditional water.  This is a perfect example of how the simple enhancement of order at the most fundamental level can have radical changes up the chain.  These dramatic results were achieved with only one change to one element in one application.

In the tholonic model, this example also applies to ideas, concepts, and intelligence;  small changes in one area can have radical consequences in the world of ideas, and of course, ideologies.

**Review of studies**

There have been a number of studies of SW using animals.  One review does a meta-analysis of these studies, “Structured Water: effects on animals”. [^322]

> This review focuses on the effects of structured water on animals when it is consumed on a daily basis. Structured water is liquid water that is given altered H-bonding structure by treatment with various forms of energy including magnetic fields and light. While most of the research has been conducted on magnetized‘ water, which has structure of short duration, recent research has examined effects of a structured water with stability of at least 3.5 months.

**Conclusion**:

> Magnetic field strengths used to treat water vary from 500 G to 32,400 G, with duration of treatment ranging from seconds (magnetic flow-through systems using several high field strength magnets) to 72 hours using small volumes with static, low field strength magnets. Inadequate water treatment results in no or minimal biological effect, whereas excessive treatment may be associated with adverse effects (see below). Based on the results of the studies presented below, a magnetic field strength of 1000 to 3000 G is required to generate water capable of exerting beneficial effects, while waters treated with field strengths greater than 5000 G may result in detrimental effects. Future studies need to provide detailed methodology and some key physico-chemical properties that are changed by the structuring process, and the duration of structural stability. Future research needs to determine the water treatment conditions that optimize for specific biological outcomes and the researchers must measure and report several key indicators that demonstrate water structuring. The latter, in particularly, would be most helpful in performing comparison between studies. **The animal research conducted to date consistently demonstrated beneficial effects of SW consumption**. Additional research is needed to demonstrate how these effects occur, and if these types of structured waters are safe to consume and use over the long term.

<img src='../Images/bullied_plant.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>There is another conclusion that also needs to be looked at, and that is not just the inability for some people to accept such findings, but their need to attack the findings.  An example of this is the very simple “experiment” for children at the IKEA store in the U.A.E. where they placed two identical plants side by side for 30 days.   The short YouTube video had 1,2 million view, with 6,700 likes and 625 dislikes, and many of teh comments were as vile as YouTube will allow.  Granted, this this exhibitions will never get publisher in the *Journal for Experimental Science*, but it is certainly sufficient to raise the question “Do emotions effect the life?”, which sounds like a ridiculously silly question, as we all know the answer to that, but while there are countless studies on the effect of plants on human emotions, there is nary a one (that I can find) on the effects of human emotions on plants.  This is unfortunate, as such a study would tell us a lot about the emotions/biology connection that is much harder to discover among the emotionally chaotic fear-driven culturally distorted minds of humans.  Unfortunately, the anger and dismissive attitudes expressed in the comments of this video are shared by leaders in the scientific community, which can at times be more of a cult of scientism.

## Qualitative Energy

One experiment to consider is the concept of *qualitative energy*.  We have countless ways to test the quantitative properties of energy, but if we are claiming that quantitative and qualitative properties are related in some way, then can property effect the other, for example, via induction?  

Measuring the value of money is quantitative, so a \$10 bill is always \$10 regardless if it came from a blood diamonds or a farmer, but many people would reject that \$10 if they knew where it was from blood diamonds &hellip;a qualitative value that had significant quantitative effects as it has shifted over $1,000,000,000 away from the blood diamond industry.  Does that make the value of the money qualitative?  Subjectively, perhaps, but not objectively because all legal tender is centrally controlled by the State in a manner that removes all qualitative value.  In addition, the State has made it illegal for create a new forms of money.  But this is not the case in the cryptocurrency world.  There are currencies whose value is hugely influenced by service they provide, such as cryptocurrencies specifically bound to agriculture (SOYA, CORA, WHEA), precious metals (XAUT, DGX, GLC, PMGT, LKNS), marijuana (POT, CANN, DOPE), and even pornography (PORNCOIN).  There are coins based on political and ideological goals, such as privacy (XRP), candidates (FJB, LGB), religions (BBP, CT).  There are more that 19,000 cryptocurrencies at teh time of this writing, each with their own underlying philosophy, vision, goals, and values. These new infant currencies demonstrate the bond between quantitative and qualitative values, and how each of these two qualities can induce changes in the other.

By the same token (pub intended), and because money is a abstract representation of energy, we can extend this idea to energy in general and ask “can qualitative attributes effect quantitative measure, or visa versa?”, “Is there such a thing as qualitative induction?”

For example, a simple test could be performed with two vases of identical water. One vase can be subjected to constructive emotions, sounds, etc, while the others are subjected to destructive emotions, sounds etc.  This water is then used to water two identical plants.  Any difference in the plant’s growth night be attributable to the “quality” of the water.  

Why not simply expose the plants to such emotions?  Because the use of the tholonically compatible substance of water as a storage medium is the real test.  How, or if, the water effects plants is really the testing of the idea.  The question of whether plants are sensitive to any non-physical or non-electromagnetic stimulus remains, but we can look to the existing theories and tests to find that answer.  One such experiment is “The Florence Experiment” where bean plants accompanied a human as they slid down a 20 meter slide installed in the *Palazzo Strozzi* Renaissance palace of art in Florence, Italy.   This exhibit was put together by plant neurobiologist Professor Stefano Mancuso, founder of the study of plant neurobiology that studies the intelligence of plants, and German artist and former entomology researcher with a Ph.D. in Phytopathology, Carsten Höllerm.  

The idea was to see how plants responded to the emotions of “fun” and “exciting”.  This experiment was followed with another experiment where plants were exposed to people watching horror films.  The result of the experiment are [JWFIX: RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS INSERTED HERE] 

[THIS SECTIONS  ONLY APPLIES IF THE TEST RESULTS ARE AFFIRMATIVE]

This is not surprising to us, as plants, being the very bridge between the source of energy for this planet (Sun) and life on this planet, must be of a very high order of intelligence, as least according to the tholonic definition of intelligence of “The ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of energy within the scope of its existence.” and the tholonic claim that “Intelligence exists in anything that has a sustainable pattern of energy.”, because plants are not only far more sustainable than all other forms of life, no other form of life is sustainable without them. 

But even the traditional definition of intelligence of “The ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or *trying* situations.” applies because the creation of life on a dead planet is about as *trying* as it gets.  We can take it further with the traditional definition of intelligence of “The ability to learn, understand, and make judgments or have opinions that are based on reason.” if we presume the tholonic intelligence that instantiated in plant life has the ability to learn, understand, make judgments, reason and even have opinions.  Now, apply the tholonic definition of “understanding”, i.e., “the knowledge of something sufficient enough to be able to make verifiably accurate statements regarding said thing”, and we can also claim that a tholon has knowledge, as every form of life is accurately described by the knowledge data-storage medium of RNA/DNA (which may have existed long before life itself).

The tholonic definition of intelligence is slightly different, “The ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of energy within the scope of its existence.”, which implicitly includes the traditional definitions, and where “reason” extends beyond current human reasoning.  As patterns come from order, which is the result of energy, and energy is awareness, then, by this reasoning, intelligence is synonymous with “ordered or structured awareness.”

Mancuso claim that plants *are* intelligent is quite compatible with the tholonic model, as is even Charles Darwin’s, albeit contextually limited by the world-view of the 1870s .

> “it’s hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle (the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination) thus endowed, and having the power of directing movements of the adjoining parts, acts like a brain of one of the lower animals.”  **~Charles Darwin, “The Power of Movement in Plants” (1880)**

What is surprising is that out current world-view continues to be based on the erroneous concepts passed down by the likes of Aristotle, who wrote in “De Anima”, that plants have a “low level”, “vegetative soul” because they are incapable of local movement and ability to sense.  Like his claims about gravity, both statements are observably wrong , even to the ancient Greeks, had he bothered to actually investigate.

## Plants as “familiars”

## Language and Metaphysics

It is well known that language has the power to hold a social order together, or to destroy it.  Language has such power because the order and hierarchy of concepts that form a social order are known, taught and defined by words.  In addition, words and language actually form neurological pathways in our brain, and these pathways exert physiological pressure in the physical structure of the language processing part of the brain.  The brilliant linguist Noam Chomsky, in his *Generative-transformational Theory* of language, states that children are born with the hard-wired understanding of language, and the only thing they need to learn is the context of how that innate understanding is culturally expressed.  

> Anecdotal to this, my son was never taught to read or write, raised in a house without TV, radio, or internet, and in a rural environment.  He was exposed to a Rudolf Steiner-esq form of learning where he was not “taught”, but rather “exposed”, allowing his innate knowledge to manifest at its natural pace.  When he entered public school at the age of 8 or 9,  his reading and writing abilities far exceeded those of his classmates. 

It must be stated that while the first casualty of war may be truth, the first act of war is an attack on language and words, which begins long before the shooting starts.  One example of such a salvo aimed as Western Culture is the post-modern concept of language and the redefining of words.  This very successful neo-Marxist offensive began in the 1960s and has been so successful that by 2022 even a U.S, Supreme Court Justice was unable to define the word “woman”, and this view was staunchly supported by the largest publishing company in the U.S., who unironically reported “[her] answer was scientifically sound. There is no sufficient way to clearly define what makes someone a woman.”[^358]

Words and language are fundamental to psychology, communications, behavior, culture, cognition, relationships, perception, identity, politics, and just about all aspects of a society.  Consequently, it’s challenging to describe ideas that use concepts that are outside our vernacular.  The only solution is to define new concepts and create new words for them. Last year, 20 new words were added to the dictionary including “ecoanxiety” , “Dunning-Kruger”, “hodophobia” (fear of traveling), “nothingburger”, “ratio” (as in “dude, you got ratio-ed”; likes/dislikes of a social media post).  The words we create, and how we use words in general, might be a good indicator as to where society is headed.  At least that is the concept behind the study of “predictive linguistics”.  The problem with predictive linguistics, and words/language in general, is that each person’s different experience with words invokes a different qualitative context[^357], so, even if everyone agrees on what the word “walk” means, it does not mean that word will invoke the same subjective context, and the context will determine the psychological, emotional, typically unconscious or “right brain” meaning of that word.  All of us have experienced this, usually with scents, places, or things, but it applies to words/language as well.

Scientific or technical words are the easiest to create because they can be clearly and definitively described.  Words to convey emotions or beliefs are harder as they are subjective, but as we all have feelings and beliefs, we can all generally agree on words like “love”, “fear”, “spirit”, “freedom”, but the specifics of these words will never be agreed upon.  It’s even harder to defined new words for existential or esoteric concepts, such as “awareness”, “consciousness”, “soul”, “god”, or the metaphysical aspects of concepts like “intention”, “free-will”, “being”.  The most challenging concepts to describe are those that are technical, emotional, and metaphysical, such as the concept of energy. Energy is everything that is, can be, and will ever be, and by everything, I mean *everything*, which includes consciousness and awareness, intentions, cause and effect, space-time, spirit, soul, free-will, and literally anything else you, or anyone who ever did, is, or will live, can imagine.

In order to describe such things we can invent new words, but unless you are a cultural icon, world leader, or brilliant scientist who has the support of the media, your new words will remain a mystery.   Many new words are serendipitous, as they were accidentally created , such as the word “malapropism” (nonsensical, often humorous utterance), which is an adaptation of the name of a character, Mrs. Malaprop, from the 1775 play “The Rivals”.  Even the word “serendipity” itself was invented by writer and politician Horace Walpole in 1754 as an allusion to *Serendip*, an old name for Sri Lanka.  “Banana Republic”, “catch-22”, “bedazzled”, “beatnik”, “cyberspace”, are all invented words that found a home in the collective consciousness of our culture because we could all recognize and agree on their meaning and agree that it filled a need.  To create a new word that describes a state of understanding, we can look to Robert Heinlein, who had to write an entire book (“Stranger in a Strange Land”, 1961) to describe the nuanced definition of the word “grok”, and even then, the definition has been drastically reduced to a simple sentence; “To understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with; also, to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment".

Short of inventing new words, we can use existing words as representative, symbolic, metaphorical allusions to describe metaphysical, supernatural, or existential concepts.  Some languages are better suited for this, so we can appropriate their words into our vernacular, such as “chi”, “chakras”,“Tao”, gestalt”, “karma”, “mantra”, “yoga”, “prana”.

How, then, can we talk about such broad and illusive concepts as SAI in a way that can be understood by all? The best we can do is use the simplest words possible, leaving less room for wildly differing interpretations.   At the most fundamental level, SAIs can be described as “I Am” and “ I Will”.  It doesn’t get more basic that that. 

In the thologram, we have the concept of a 0-dimensional point which only has two attributes, SAI, however, the singularity of that point can only be described as “I”. This is the first duality of *somethingness* and *nothingness*, that of “I” and “Not I”.

The 1<sup>st</sup> creation of “I” is “Am”, which was created by the 1<sup>st</sup> movement of “I”, making “Am” the first verb of “to be”. This is the 1<sup>st</sup> instance of *Awareness*, “I Am”, and is represented by the first creation of the green dot of *Definition/Limitation*.  This movement also created another instance, that of “Will”, as the movement, whatever it was, was an act of volition, as nothing moves unless force is applied to it (the nature of this movement and volition is another topic altogether).  This “Will” is represented by the red dot, that of *Contribution/integration*, and is the 1<sup>st</sup> instance of *Intention*.  It is the *force* of  *intention* that caused the primal movement, and it is the *intention* of that primal movement to return to a balanced state, just as it is force that causes energy to move, and it is the *intention* of energy to always return to balance.

We now have 3 concepts that describe the creation of the first trigram; “I”, “I Am”,  and “I Will”.  This should sound familiar as we briefly touched ion the same theme in Chapter 7, *Structure*.  This association between the thologram and ancient spiritual knowledge was never intended, but it was inevitable as both paths are based on the same laws of existence.

Prior to introducing the concept of the thologram we touched on the linguistic implications of the ancient name of the Abrahamic god being “I Am **That** I Am” in chapter 7,  “*Structure*”,  and demonstrated how that phrase refers to that which is both a *finished* an *unfinished* state of being, or, *that which is*, *that which could be,* and *that which will be*.  Here, we look deeper into our ancestor’s attempts to describe the emerging concept of “The Creator”.

<img src='../Images/iam-grid.png' style='float:right;width:18%'/>Immediately we are challenged with the obfuscation of language. The verb “I Am” (<img src='../Images/iam.png' style='height:10px'/>) in ancient Hebrew can also mean “I Will”, as there was no *past* or *future* tense in those days (as present tense was implicit), only *finished* and *unfinished* tense (*perfect* and *imperfect* forms) , so the act of being *what is* and being *what one wills to be*, or *what could be*, are one in the same as far as past and future goes, but has two states, one that is *finished*, and one that is *unfinished*, or *that which is* (awareness) and *that which will be* (intention).  Even more confounding is that there was no verb for the present tense of “being”.  To communicate the message “I am a man” one would say “I man”.  I assume the this is because the “am” part is explicit by the obvious fact that the speaker exists.  So, “I Am” would be something like “I who I”, or just “I I”, which is pronounced “*Ina ina*“  or “*ana ana*”, or maybe just “*Na na*” as the Aleph (&aleph;) in Hebrew is a consonant, not a vowel.  The form of “*Ina Ina*” is a mantra used by some Christians to this day. There was also blurring of the difference between the seemingly innocent words of “that”, “what” and “who”, as all three concepts were represented as a single word (<img src='../Images/who.png' style='height:10px'/>), and it was the context that was deterministic. Consequently, there are at least 28 different ways to interpret what God said to Moses (see table), not including the most based interpretation of “I I”. This is further obfuscated by the fact that Moses could not go to his people and say “I Am That I Am, and I have come to save you”.  Not only would that sound a bit over the top and highly suspicious, it was probably the case, as pointed out by Jaynes[^31], that human consciousness at that time could only perceive god as someone/something outside of themselves.  So, it’s only reasonable that the voice of god would have to tell Moses that he should tell his people that he was sent not by “I Am That I Am” (<img src='../Images/iam.png' style='height:10px'/>), but by “He Will Be”(<img src='../Images/yhvh.png' style='height:10px'/>), but, as that word is made of 3 verbs, it could also means “He was” (*perfect*), “He (is)” (implied *present*), “He will be” (*imperfect*). It is from this word we get the name Jehovah, figuratively meaning “He Is God”.  

<center><img src='../Images/ancient-yhvh_2.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

Now we have 56 names for god; 28 in the 1<sup>st</sup> person, and another 28 names in the 3<sup>rd</sup> person, but no matter how you translate any of these names, god is always in the 3<sup>rd</sup> person.  This is a concept that keeps the Abrahamic religions (and many others as well) sustainable, so it is not only valid, but “true”, at least as long as such beliefs are sustained.

Why are we getting into this linguistic linguine?  To show how painfully convoluted we have managed to scramble the simplest concepts that exist, that of “I Am” and “I Will”.  After thousands of years and thousands of volumes of opinion, doctrine, religious law, and in spite of the deliberate hiding/misspelling/encrypting/misinterpreting of the name of god (as it was forbidden to be spoken) there is still heated debate as to the “real” and/or “secret” significance of these words.  And if this subject wasn’t already shrouded in the mystical symbolism of Moses’ isolated vision, it has been translated from Phoenician to Hebrew to Greek to English and dozens of other languages, none of which hold the same significance as the language of Moses. Historians say that the Phoenician alphabet evolved out of symbols for things like fish (<img src='../Images/p_fish.png' style='height:10px'/>), eye (<img src='../Images/p_eye.png' style='height:10px'/>), tooth (<img src='../Images/p_tooth.png' style='height:10px'/>), weapon (<img src='../Images/p_weapon.png' style='height:10px'/>), etc., and even though the symbols and order are similar to Hebrew (and Greek), the legend is that Hebrew came from the words that were written with black fire on white fire in the presence of god, and that these words are the Torah as well as all the names of god.  

Obviously, the significance of letters, words, and sentences will be dramatically different even between these similar languages.  While any belief that advances dogma and confusion of any kind is a belief that is detrimental in understating the nature of reality, but such beliefs have existed for thousands of years and appear to be very sustainable.  In light of their success, let’s offer a simple description of the tholonic concept that is linguistically and conceptually compatible with many belief systems and which may shed light on their cryptic symbolism. 

## What? That!

You enter a restaurant and the waiter asks you “**What** would you like?”, and you reply “I’ll take **that**.” pointing to a plate of Rocky Mountain Oysters.  “What” is defining the context and is synonymous with “anything that” (with the implied “is on the menu”).  When “what” is used as a *predeterminer*, such as “What a great idea!”, it is still referring to the larger concept of “great idea” and is stating that the specific idea is worthy of being a member of the “great idea” category.  Any use of “what” will always refer to some context, either explicitly or implicitly; Bob: “I have money for the meter, so we can park here.”, Carol: “I have six toes.”,  Bob: “What!?”.

The word “that” is, grammatically, a *determiner* and a *relative pronoun* because it always refers to something specific that is contextually relative, and implies a plurality of potential “that’s”.  There’s no need for the waiter to ask **what** you want, or for you to say “I’ll have **that**”, if the only thing **that** they serve is Rocky Mountain Oysters.  

“I Am That I Am” is stating that the existence of “I Am” is, and only is, awareness of “I”, and that the entirely of that awareness is, and only is, the singularity of **that** awareness.  There is no context for **that** which is “I Am” other than “I Am”.  It is perfectly self-referential as “I Am” consists of only of **that** singularity **that** is “I Am”.  On other hand, “I Am **What** I Am” means that the entirety of “I Am” is the sum of its parts, and even if those parts are instances of “I Am”, it is not a singularity because “what” explicitly refers to a plurality in contrast to the singularity of “that”. 

<img src='../Images/popeye.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>Tholonically, “I Am **That** I Am” describes the source of creation, and therefore the thologram as a whole,  and “I Am **What** I Am” describes all the child tholons (and *Popeye the Sailorman’s* world view.  For those who might not know, Popeye was fond of saying “I yam what I yam, and that's all what I yam”).  If you were asked “**What** shape (in the above below) is identical to the outline of all the shapes?” you would point to the first shape and say “**That** one”, but if I asked “Hand me the triangle shaped one”, you’d probably ask “**What** version would you like?”  All the forms can be said to be that of trigrams, but there is only one case where the whole and the part, the context and the content, are identical, and that is the first instance where the **part** equals the whole rather than the **parts** equaling the whole.

<center><img src='../Images/trizirp.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

Descartes has a similar understanding is this concept when he coined “Cognito, ergo sum” (*I think, therefore I am*)[^359].  Unfortunately, qualifying “I Am” with “I Think” could easily be perceived as intellectual hubris, or worse, self-defeating and dangerously ignorant.  While Descartes was a brilliant mathematician, scientist, philosopher and even metaphysician, we have to understand his world view in the context of 17<sup>th</sup> century Europe, before Newton, and even before the *Age of Enlightenment*, as many historian consider the *Age of Enlightenment* to have begun when Descartes originally coined this phrase with his publication of “Discourse on Method”.  The Western concepts of mind, consciousness, and thought were only beginning to hatch and they would quickly grow to be recognized as the defining quality that not only separated man from beast and made man a divine creature.  We can’t just blame intellectual arrogance that the intelligentsia of the day saw themselves closer to, and favored by, their all-powerful Christian sky-god, as this pitfall comes packaged with the ability to say “I” in the first place, but it no doubt played a role in their world view of those who ushered in the Age of Enlightenment.  The ability to have the concept of “I Am” was only possible for those that possessed  consciousness and rationality, as least in the way these concepts were defined later by Freud.  According to Freud, consciousness and rationality are not only ego-centric, but the are the source of the ego.  

Being the pioneer that Freud was, we should view his theories as “first drafts” of psychological theory, especially in light of the cultural revolution fueled by madness and modernity in 1900 Vienna.  The seeds of this revolution were being sewn 50 years earlier in Leipzig, Germany, when Gustav Fechner’s theories created what would later become *physiological science*, and 1879, when William Wundt founded the first laboratory for psychological research, also in Leipzig, and which was succeeded the empirical psychology of Ferdinand Ueberwasse.  It was this intellectual garden of the rigid, disciplined, demanding, competitive, imperialist German culture that was being strictly enforced the some-what tyrannical “Iron Chancellor”, Otto von Bismarck, that nourished the theories of Freud, Jung, Adler, Titchener, and the other midwives of modern psychology that quickly spread throughout the western world.  It was this view of humanity that is responsible for the modern concept of “self” as an immutable state as well as producing sociopaths such as B. F. Skinner and Ivan Pavlov.  The tholonic view is that “self”, like all tholons, is always in a state of growth, change, adaptation.  There is no “self”, there are only instances of “self” that are contextually relevant.  The energy that launches rockets and the energy that moves your arms is the same, only in different convex, just as a small bubble contains the same air as a large bubble.  The reality of the bubble or energy is defined exclusively by the properties and scope of it instantiation.  Remove that context and there is only air or SAI.  As the context changes, so too does the “self”.  The concept of “self-awareness” is not only an illusion, but a deception, as it reinforces the concept of an isolated, separate, individual spiritual identity.  This is similar to the deceptive concept of “social justice”, as there is only justice, social or otherwise, or the Orwellian idea that peace can be attained though war, and is a major factor in the growth of a malignant form of *Individual Identitarianism*.  Tholonically, “self-awareness” is a divisive illusion, while “awareness” alone is a fundamental truth.  Nevertheless, the concept of “self” is quite powerful in the realm of modern culture.

While it is unreasonable to suggest that the conscious and rational thinking is ego-centric, it is not unreasonable to see how one must have an have the concept of “I” before they can say “I Think”, and, having such a concept, it would be natural for god-fearing Christians to consider themselves “special” and “better” in the eyes of their rather demanding, judging and punishing god compared to plants and animals.  While consciousness and rationality are not ego-centric, that does not means that conscious, rational humans are not egotistical and self-serving any more than the benefits of fire does not mean it won’t do a lot of damage if uncontrolled.  This ailment of the human condition, the belief that man was not just “better” than all else, but was destined to control all else, was also supported by the very word of god, as the bible clearly states, in no uncertain terms, that man is *commanded* to subdue and dominate all that lives (“Subdue” in Hebrew is “kavesh”, which means ”A stool upon which to put one’s feet; to force into submission; to put and end to”.  The modern word “kabash”, as in “Put the kabash on it”, meaning to end it, comes for the word “kavesh”) :

> “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” **~Genesis 1.26**

It’s not surprising then, that for a devout 17<sup>th</sup> century Christian, which includes most, if not all, the great minds of Western modern culture, the concept of “I think” and “I Am” were essentially synonymous.  That which did not have the concept of “I” was no more useful than how it was judged to be useful by man.  “I think therefore I am” was the same as “I am, therefore I am”, which (if you have not seen it already) is the same as “I Am That I Am”.  The difference is, Moses was hearing the voice of god, and Descartes was using reason.  One migth wonder, was the the voice of god, as heard by Moses, and the tagline for the *Age of Enlightenment*, the same concept perceived in two different contexts?  Tholonically, yes, but that begs the question: is reason the modern day voice of god, or was the ancient voice of god an early instance of reason?  

While the thologram has no concept of a divine creator (beyond that of a 0-dimensional dot in an infinite nothingness, it does have a concept of a hierarchy of intelligences that have awareness and intention. From the tholonic view, both epiphanies were due to the intentions of a greater intelligence to instantiate itself, but not simply *a* greater intelligence, but many greater intelligences that are constantly in a stage of negotiation via conflict and cooperation.

## Are Archetypes Alive?

If ideas are archetypes that have energy and fields, then it would be reasonable to think that an idea could be reinforced and strengthened by adding more energy to it.  How would one go about adding energy to an idea? If awareness is energy, then one obvious way would be to simply increase the awareness that an idea is exposed to.  This sort of thing is done all the time.  Take, for example, National Prayer Day in the U.S. (May 7th) when the President signs a proclamation encouraging all Americans to pray on this day and “turn to God”.

Now, imagine the potential power of 114,000,000 consciousnesses all being exposed to the same symbolism at the same time. This is exactly what happened during the broadcast of Super Bowl XLIX (2014), but unlike National Prayer Day where the participants voluntarily focused their awareness towards one idea, it was more like a National Awareness Harvesting Minute of the awareness of the 114,000,000 unwitting participants.  Unlike the barrage of commercials and propaganda we are subjected to on a daily basis, this particular event was unique. According to a very suspicious article[^169] that was written by a conveniently anonymous designer who claimed to have once worked in the graphics department of a huge media company, out of boredom and his opposition to the then administration of President Bush, he deliberately hid pyramid eyes, pentagrams, and symbols from John Dee, the infamous sixteenth century occultist to the Queen of England, into the intro and promo videos for everything from war events to major sports events, including Super Bowl XLIX. Ignoring the question of why the designer thought secret occult symbols were a good choice to subliminally oppose President Bush, it was not the claim that was suspicious, as with just a little investigation his claims can be confirmed, but that this published article, which appeared overnight on over 36,000 websites, conveniently provided a “plausible deniability” defense for the media companies when Internet sleuths were discovering these symbols. Regardless of the intentions of those responsible, the effect was that a tremendous amount of awareness, albeit unconscious awareness, was pumped into these images; images that have existing archetypes, and therefore, according to the tholonic model, their own awareness, intention and intelligence.

Considering the average American youth spends 900 hours a year in school, and another 1,200 hours a year watching television, and that 70% of the American adult waking life is spent in front of digital media, [^170] and that the average 78.6 year old American will spend nine years of his life watching TV, two years of which is just watching commercials, we're talking about a tremendous amount of awareness up for grabs. How is that currently being used?

The more pessimistic reader might begin to suspect that the manipulation of awareness as energy is perhaps already well understood by some less-than-noble folks. Others may think this is bordering on mystical conspiracy theories.  The reader will come to their own conclusions. Our intention is to question the effects of such awareness harvesting, especially in light of the understanding that ideas have a life of their own. This includes ancient ideas, even if they seem to have been forgotten by modern society.

We have the ability to tap into these archetypal realities whenever we like or need, and often do unconsciously. This is the purpose and power of myths, be they ancient or modern. As these archetypes originate in the uninstantiated tholonic state, they are free from the limitations of our space-time reality, and therefore they are eternal, or at least, long-lived. The myths and beliefs of the ancient past continue to live on in ever-evolving meaning and symbolism that promote their existence, almost like a self-mutating virus. This is the source of talismanic, totem or symbolic “magic” and the invoking of deities, intelligences, energies, be they “good guys” or “bad guys” (although it’s often hard to tell them apart).

Much of our everyday culture is inextricably bound to these archetypes and thereby further empowering them, usually without our knowledge. Jung described these archetypes as “ordering factors in the collective unconscious”. These are the twelve archetypes of the human psyche organized into four cardinal types, which we described earlier.

For example, the modern word “hell” comes from the ancient Norse goddess named *Hel* whose job it was to not only judge the dead but also help the apocalypse along by leading an army of the dead in a ship made of the fingernails of corpses.

The concept of Hell, or whatever it happens to be called, is deeply ingrained into the worldview of billions of people who have little knowledge of the roots of their beliefs. These believers, through the energy of their awareness, bring into creation associated and/or parasitic archetypes that are attached to primary archetypes which they are completely unaware of, but which are energized by that awareness nevertheless. While this can’t be proven, I suspect that the more people who believe in hell, the more empowered and manifest the concept of an apocalypse as these concepts are embodied together in at least one tholon, that of the goddess *Hel*.  The ironic part is that believing in the traditional Christian or Islamic heaven by default empowers their concept of a hell, as they are presented as two sides of one state; the afterlife.

Looking at the non-intuitive, humorous, and bizarre ways ancient and modern concepts have formed relationships will give just a hint of how intertwined archetypes can become.  For example, we can draw a very straight line of connection from the invention of hieroglyphics and moon worship to pharmaceutical drugs and those vacuum sealed plastic bags of imported Colombian coffee you buy at the supermarket, connecting along the way with magicians, pyramids, thieves and secret societies. The super-short version goes something like this: The Egyptian moon god, Thoth, who invented hieroglyphics, was adopted by the Greeks who called him Hermes, who was among other things, the protector of thieves. He carried the Caduceus, which became the symbol of modern medicine, and was the founder of the super-secret mystical teachings of Hermetism. So protected were these teachings that the word *hermetic* became synonymous with *perfectly sealed*, hence, *hermetically sealed* bags.  Language, as a way to convey concepts, is a microcosm of how archetypes merge, evolve, and reproduce.

What we have referred to as an uninstantiated tholon can, at least in this context, be an archetypes as a form of *metameme*, which is a form of a *meme* that only exists in the collective unconscious and/or in the world of archetypes, the thologram. If a meme is “an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture”, then a metameme is an “an idea or belief formed within the tholonic field (i.e. universal mind,  collective unconscious, morphic field, etc.) and spreads from tholonic field to tholonic field”.   

You make have heard phrases like  “If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, its probably a duck.”, or “When you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras.”, or “The simplest explanation is most likely the right one”, otherwise known as *Occam’s Razor*. Applying the wisdom of this advice, what are we to make of the fact that research out of Princeton University supports the theory that ideas, in the form of social media networks, follow the same growth models as viruses (in the form of diseases)? [^171] Outside of the conclusion that perhaps Facebook is actually a viral disease, it tells us that ideas follow the same patterns as existing natural patterns of growth, suggesting we might learn more about the life of archetypes if we considered them living.  OK, viruses *may* not be “alive”, but I say *may* because some experts in the field are redefining “life” to include viruses. [^172],[^173] Regardless, the growth, survival and creation of ideas follow the same patterns as everything else that grows, survives and creates. For this reason, a clever researcher might be able to find correlations between the life cycle of a galaxy and something as seemingly unrelated as, say, the life cycle of a tomato plant. One such researcher might be Tokyo Institute of Technology’s Maruyama Shigenori, a leading geophysicist and founder of the Center for Bio-Earth Planetology, who, by connecting the theories of astronomy with those of the life sciences, has shown how entire planets may well be living super-organisms.

This idea that archetypes are alive, however, has a dark side to it because so many of our beliefs are manipulated and controlled by others whose agenda is less than altruistic, hidden, and who are aware of the mechanics of reality and consciousness. From the most powerful laser in the world named after the Hindu god of destruction to trivial tarot cards based on movie stars, we can find countless examples of how these imposed archetypes infiltrate our understanding of the world.

So, what kind of world are we creating with our awareness, desires, and beliefs, as a planet? To find out, I wrote a mobile phone app that allows people to send out into the universe either a blessing or a curse.  The app was (unsurprisingly) called “Bless or Curse”.

The majority of both blesses and curses are about…wait for it…love, money, and health (surprise!). Some were touching, such as the blessing of “May he win lotto,” cast upon the bus driver who “stopped just for me”. Some are bizarrely dark, such as the curse of “Torture Rape Murder die die die die die,” cast upon Noisy Walgreen Employees. The predominant *cursers*, were Iran, Southern Australia, Puerto Rico, Russia/North Korean border, western South Africa, and Honolulu.  Predominant *blessers* were northwest Canada, southwest U.S., Eastern Europe, South pacific, Uruguay, Ghana/Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and the jungles of Northern Brazil.

Humanity seems to be pretty well split down the middle between the *blessers* and the *cursers*, as you can see by this report map below. In general, it tended to hover over the 53% area, giving the *blessers* a slight edge over the *cursers*.

### Tulpas

One of the better legends of how ideas can take on a life of their own comes from the well-known 1932 book, *Magic And Mystery In Tibet*, by Belgian-French explorer Alexandra David-Néel.

In the Far East, there is the concept of a *tulpa*, which is a type of thought-form. They are understood to be a sentient consciousness that resides in the brain of the host and can have separate feelings, thoughts, and memories from the host and can communicate through thought, imagination, feelings, or verbally. With enough practice and concentration, the host can see the tulpa’s form in the real world, and for the truly advanced *tulpamancer*, can be seen by others as well. Of course, this is a preposterous idea to Western thinkers. 

Alexandra David-Neel was a woman of remarkable courage. She recounts how the only way she could enter the forbidden (to foreigners) city of Lhasa, Tibet, was to sneak in dressed as a beggar carrying only a compass, money (for ransom in case she was kidnapped), and a gun. She was also known for her sound scientific thinking and her opinions and observation carried weight in academic and scientific circles. Doctor A. D’Arsonval, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, The Academy of Medicine, professor at the College of France and president of the Institute of General Psychology, said of Alexandra David-Néel:

> This well-known and courageous explorer of Tibet unites in herself all the physical, moral and intellectual qualities that could be desired of one who is to observe and examine a subject of this kind.[^174]

So, when she described how she used the techniques taught to her by the Tibetan magicians to conjure up her own *tulpa*, it is not as easy to discard them as pure fantasy. In her case, she manifested a short, pudgy, jolly monk, as per her intentions.  Perhaps even more interesting was that this tulpa, once it began to be visible to others, began to have its own free will, a life of its own; the jolly, fat monk began to grow lean and taller, and less jolly. It eventually became a major problem for her, and she had to spend six months “dissolving” it. As she states:

> The fat, chubby-cheeked fellow grew leaner, his face assumed a vaguely mocking, sly, malignant look. He became more troublesome and bold. In brief, he escaped my control. I ought to have let the phenomenon follow its course, but the presence of that unwanted companion began to prove trying to my nerves; it turned into a ‘day-nightmare.’ Moreover, I was beginning to plan my journey to Lhasa and needed a quiet brain devoid of other preoccupations, so I decided to dissolve the phantom. I succeeded, but only after six months of hard struggle. My mind-creature was tenacious of life. There is nothing strange in the fact that I may have created my own hallucination. The interesting point is that in these cases of materialization, others see the thought-forms that have been created.

Whether tulpas exist or not is left to the reader. The point is that the belief that ideas can take on a life if their own is neither new nor unique.

On a related note, keep an eye on the research into what is essentially the collective consciousness of artificial intelligence, or *A.I. Swarms*, as they are called,[^175],[^176] and the early attempts to create artificial humans.[^177] Science and technology is attempting to create their own “tulpas”, and one day they may also prove to be “more troublesome and bold, escaping our control.”
