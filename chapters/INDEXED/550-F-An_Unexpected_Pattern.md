# Appendix F: An Unexpected <u>Pattern</u>

###### What is this <u>pattern</u> and why does it exist?

In the course of writing this book there was the need to generate sets of chaotic <u>numbers</u> from other sets of <u>patterned</u> numbers.  In one case, the results presented a very unexpected pattern.

<u>Numbers</u> were generated by periodically calculating the longitudinal position of the Sun and the Moon (from <u>Earth</u>’s coordinates of -34.61262S, -58.41048W, Buenos Aires, Argentina on the 24<sup>th</sup> of each month at 5:31:07 PM UT) down to 10<sup>-15</sup>  radians.  The individual digits of these two values were then concatenated, or cross-summed.  For example, the Sun’s longitude in radians at one moment was 4.2430033683776855, and the Moon’s position at that same moment was 2.399298667907715.  These were then cross-summed until they are reduced to a single digit value.

- 4+2+4+3+0+0+3+3+6+8+3+7+7+6+8+5+5=**74**
- *2+3+9+9+2+9+8+6+6+7+9+0+7+7+1+5=**90***
- *74+90=**164***
- *1+6+4=**11***
- *1+1=**2***

Millions of samples were recorded and reduced to one <u>number</u> per sample.  The input <u>data</u> of the Son and Moon positions was perfectly non-random and linear, but the single cross-summed <u>number</u> series of <u>data</u> was “mostly <u>random</u>” according to the *Chi squared* results of a <u>randomness</u> test[^195].  Below are the test results of the single-number <u>data</u> and the <u>data</u> from a <u>random</u> <u>number</u> generator (RNG), for comparison[^196],[^197].

<center><img src='../Images/rng.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Next, each single digit <u>number</u> (1-9) was assigned a color from the spectrum and then plotted such that each dot occupied one consecutive pixel on one line, and when that line was full, the plot advanced to the next line, just like a dot-matrix printer.  This was an extremely simple plot.  The below-left plot shows only one <u>number</u> being plotted at a time, and the below-right plot shows cumulative numbers.  The distribution of the <u>numbers</u> within the <u>data</u> set of 33,000,000 is shown in the bar chart.

The <u>data</u> was also tested against Benford’s <u>Law</u>, which states that the first digit in a naturally occurring set of values will be distributed in a manner dependent on the log of that number.  We looked at three sets of data; the crossed-sums of the Sun, Moon, and combined, by counting the <u>number</u> of each digit 1 through 9 in a <u>data</u> set of 33,575,635 <u>data</u> samples.  While the <u>numbers</u> were similar in count, they were not similar enough to suggest an even distribution as we would see in <u>random</u> <u>numbers</u>, and not in accordance with Benford’s Law.  To see the difference in these totals, we plotted the difference between the lowest and and highest counts (charts below) for each <u>number</u> 1-9.  As you can see, there is some very <u>patterned</u> behavior, especially in the first chart and even more so in the last charts which s, as the prime <u>numbers</u> are reduced .

<center><img src='../Images/2cspos.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Much to our surprise, this resulting <u>pattern</u> matches that of a *Fresnel diffraction*.

<center><img src='../Images/123456789comp.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

At the rate we were sampling, each position of each “<u>planet</u>” was only about 7x10<sup>-8</sup> radians further than the previous position sampled.  This equates to about 23 kilometers of <u>movement</u> for the Sun and only 64 millimeters of <u>movement</u> of the Moon.

When cross-summing <u>numbers</u>, the place of each digit is insignificant, so 123 and 321 are the same as they both cross-sum to 6.  Because all the digits in a cross-summed value have equal significance, the slightest measurable <u>movement</u> of the sun is equal to the <u>movement</u> of the two-thousand years it takes to pass through a constellation. This is because 0.000000000000001 is the same as 100000000000000.0

Above, we plotted the values simply as colors, but when we use the actual values of the cross-summed <u>numbers</u> as the Y-axis, with each <u>number</u> advancing one step across the X-axis (time), we get a different perspective, as seen in the top image below.  The bottom image is the same plot but only using the differences between each number.

This plot uses 300,000 cross-summed <u>data</u> points that covers 25 minutes of observation.

<center><img src='../Images/CS-totals.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

What was surprising is that the top image appears to be a the cross-sectional diagram of a Fresnel lens!

This raises the questions:

- Where do these <u>patterns</u> come from?
- Do they tell us anything about the thing being measured?
- Given that these <u>patterns</u> are the same that describe the propagation and near-field diffraction of light (i.e. Fresnel diffraction), can we apply any other attributes of light to whatever we are observing?

**Additional details for the curious**

Below are some of the visual results of the plot.

These plots are of <u>data</u> captured every 0.005 and .01 seconds and we only are looking at the cross-summed values that are prime <u>numbers</u> (2,3,5,7), but the results were the same when using all <u>number</u> 0-9.  These twelve plots represent sampled <u>data</u> from each month of the year at the same time.

<img src='../Images/sun-moon-patterns.png' style='width:100%'/>It is interesting to see how the 0.005s look slightly “zoomed out” compared to the 0.01s. Also interesting is how the plot pattern and the pattern of wood grain is so similar, suggesting the source of these patterns also share a common process. at least mathematically.

If we change the time between samples from microseconds to days, we see another pattern.  Below are ten sets representing ten months with the same starting point as the sets above, but each pixel represents an entire day (86480 seconds), i.e., the position of the Sun and the Moon was recorded only once a day.  This means that the entire set represents 1,095 years.  Each plot looked almost identical and appeared completely <u>random</u>, but upon closer examination, they were not <u>random</u> at all, but a very “zoomed out” view.  It is clearer to see the <u>pattern</u> if we only show the blue dots of a small section of the image.

<center><img src='../Images/day-sun-moon.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

My first assumption was the farther “out” we zoom, in time, the clearer the <u>patterns</u>, but it seems to be the exact opposite;  the smaller the time delta, the larger the pattern.  This might make sense if we were looking at the linear difference between, say, 1.234567 and 1.2345678, as the difference would be 0.0000008, and such a small change would need a lot of samples to make itself apparent, but this does not apply here because we are cross-summing the <u>numbers</u> together, making  the place of the digits meaningless.

Below is a comparison of the <u>patterns</u> at each scale.  The values above the images are the interval sampling time, and the values below is the entire duration of the sample.  No obvious <u>pattern</u> can be seen at 5s, but a slight <u>pattern</u> begins to emerge at 0.5s, becomes more clear at 0.05s, and is most dominant at 0.005s.  A <u>pattern</u> is equally visible in 0.0005s, but it appears only as a simple <u>oscillation</u> or wave.  0.00005 is identical to 0.0005 because (it seems that) once we start going below 0.002, we hit the limits of resolution.  This is the point where we begin getting duplicate <u>data</u> because the Sun or Moon has not moved enough in the small amount of time between samples, and the smaller we go the more duplicates we get.  For example, at 0.00001 second intervals of sampling , to get the 155,520 unique <u>data</u> points to create the graph, we need to sample 50,000,000 times.  This simple <u>wave</u> <u>pattern</u> is the first <u>wave</u> <u>pattern</u> we can detect (given the <u>limitation</u> of my laptop and/or the ephemeris used to calculate <u>planetary</u> positions).  This simple <u>wave</u> <u>pattern</u> is what then evolves into the more complex patterns.  Presumably, the difference between sample points in the <u>wave</u> <u>patterns</u> is only the rightmost last digit being increased by 1, given that we keep sampling until we get the next unique number.

<center><img src='../Images/sun-moon-grades.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

How do we have <u>patterns</u> when we sample of 0.01, but nothing (significant) when we sample as .05?  I think this has to do with where we are sampling from within the entire pattern.  The two images below shows that the Fresnel <u>pattern</u> is slightly altered with time, but eventually returns.  At its most ordered point it looks like Fresnel diffraction, but at its least ordered point it looks identical to pure <u>random</u> <u>data</u> (but we assume it is just as ordered, only difficult to see that <u>order</u>).

<center><img src='../Images/allnumcomp.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

When the <u>data</u> is sampled we have no idea where within the <u>cycle</u> of repeating <u>patterns</u> we are, so it is only by chance that we will end up in an ordered section.

For those not familiar with Fresnel diffraction, it is the way that light <u>interferes</u> with itself as it travels around the edge of an object

**Digging Deeper**

Having no idea where to look for more <u>information</u>, I posted this to various mathematics forums, and even though the question was read by many, no one had an answer.  I then sent this question to my old friend who is an accomplished physicist, but who also considers these speculative <u>ideas</u> to be a waste of time, so I knew any answer he gave would include an unabashed commentary on the silliness of it all.

He did not disappoint on either front.  I’ll forego the commentary and just focus on the relevant part of his reply, which was very short.  Essentially he told me that no matter how hard you try to create <u>random</u> <u>numbers</u> from non-random <u>data</u>, you will always end up with some sort of a pattern.  “Why?” was my naive response, to which he replied only “Look into Zipf’s <u>Law</u>”.

Zipf’s <u>Law</u> is (from Wikipedia):

>  an *empirical <u>law</u>*… that refers to the fact that many types of <u>data</u> …can be approximated with [certain types of] power <u>law</u> probability distributions.  Zipf distribution is related to the *zeta distribution*, but is not identical.

There are two very significant points in this definition.  The first is that it is an *empirical law.*  Something is called an *empirical <u>law</u>* when it can be observed, but not proven (yet).  The second important detail is that *Zipf distribution* is related to *Zeta distribution*.  We’ll get to that in a moment.

Zipf’s <u>Law</u> was not discovered by physicists or even within the hard sciences.  It was a French stenographer, Jean-Baptiste Estoup (1868 - 1950) that first discovered the <u>patterns</u> of words which became Zipf’s <u>Law</u> after it was popularized by the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902 - 1950).

It seems that languages, all languages, from every corner of the world, both modern and ancient, follow Zipf’s <u>law</u> in the way words are distributed in both writing and speaking (and by inference, some implicit <u>pattern</u> in the way we think).  We don’t need to drill into the details, but what is significant is that this same distribution <u>pattern</u> is also seen in city populations, solar flare intensities, <u>protein</u> sequences and immune receptors, the amount of traffic websites get, earthquake magnitudes, the <u>number</u> of times academic papers are cited, last names, the firing <u>patterns</u> of neural networks, ingredients used in cookbooks, the <u>number</u> of phone calls people received, the diameter of Moon craters, the <u>number</u> of people that die in wars, the popularity of opening chess moves, even the rate at which we forget… and countless more.[^198]

<center><img src='../Images/many-zipfs.png' style='width:100%'/> </center>


In short, Zipf’s <u>law</u> is an example of *power <u>laws</u>*, and power <u>laws</u> touch everything in <u>existence</u> in one way or another.  But what does this have to to with anything?  This is where the second point applies.  The charts above are called *Zipf Distributions*, and they all have different scales of values based on the kind of <u>data</u> being sampled.  If we reduce all the scales to 1, we have what is called a normalized *Zipf distribution*, also known as a *Zeta distribution*.  Mathematicians use the *Riemann zeta function (RZF)* to study and test these distributions.  This function is written as  **ζ(*s*)**, where ***s*** is any complex <u>number</u> other than 1.

<center><img src='../Images/rzf-form.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Related sidenote, using just prime <u>numbers</u> you can also determine &pi;, but this has nothing to do with RZF:  <IMG src="../Images/math/301.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>.

One of the useful features of the RZF is that it can turn a *<u>divergent</u>* series of <u>numbers</u> (numbers that when you add then together approach inftyity) into a *<u>convergent</u>* series (when the sum approaches a specific value, like <IMG src="../Images/math/302.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> or <IMG src="../Images/math/311.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>).  It can do this because the hypothesis uses the <u>concept</u> of *analytic continuation* and *complex <u>numbers</u>*.  You can play with this function using an online Riemann Zeta Function Calculator.  [^199]

The RZF is based on the *Riemann hypothesis*, which also states that  ζ(*s*)=0 only when *s* is a negative even integer or a complex number with real part of <IMG src="../Images/math/304.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>.  This hypothesis is really quite profound in the way it relates to the distribution of prime numbers.  That won’t be explained here, but it is understandable when properly explained.  There are a couple of excellent videos on the subject at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD0NjbwqlYw> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6c6uIyieoo>.

This 160-year-old hypothesis has yet to be proven, however, and because it is considered by many mathematicians to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics, the Clay Mathematics Institute has a reward of US &dollar;1,000,000 to anyone who could solve it.  *(Update.  September 24, 2018.  Michael Atiyah , the 89 year old mathematician emeritus at The University of Edinburgh, claims he has proved this, but many experts doubt its validity)*

<u>Understanding</u> how the RZF works would (probably) help explain the how and why <u>patterns</u> of <u>numbers</u> appear organically in any data-set of naturally occurring samples, such as the charts above.

What value would we get if we applied the RZF to the series of square roots of natural <u>numbers</u>, the same <u>numbers</u> that define a Fresnel diffraction?  Some really smart person did exactly this [^200], and the answer is…  voilà!

<center><img src='../Images/sqrt2pi.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

This is the inverse of <IMG src="../Images/math/305.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>, and is especially interesting because now we have a formula that fits into the *pattern-position* of Ohm’s <u>Law</u> and Newton’s <u>laws</u> of motions.  This is consistent with, and supports, the <u>ideas</u> put forth earlier that archetypal functions or formulas instantiate differently depending on their context, similar to how the <u>energy</u> of <u>nature</u> interacts with itself across various contexts as was previously shown.  For clarity, we’ll refer contextual functions that are algorithmically identical has having the same *pattern-positions* (*PP*).  An example of this, as previously shown, is the single (fractal) function with various contextual parameters that describes the <u>energy</u> interacts with itself across various contexts.

<center><img src='../Images/lightning-3.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

In this case, as we are only looking at Ohm’s <u>Law</u> and its twelve formulas, we see that <IMG src="../Images/math/305.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> has the same *<u>pattern</u>* as <IMG src="../Images/math/306.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>  or <IMG src="../Images/math/307.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>  at *position* 11:00 (as in the 12-hour clock) on the twelve-part wheel we are using, and we can test that by plugging in the appropriate values.  The table below shows these pi-based values that seem to describe the pi-based values we are seeing with regard to Ohm’s Law.  For the sake of clarity, I assigned some of the formulas to variables, otherwise it’s too bothersome to read (or compose).  In the table below, I show Ohm’s <u>Law</u> with some previously shown examples plus the simple <u>math</u> examples and then the application of <IMG src="../Images/math/305.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> and <IMG src="../Images/math/310.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:12pt;"/>.  Those two values alone were enough to fill in all the missing values.  In the middle column of the table I show the actual <u>numbers</u>, and to the right, the formulas.

<center><img src='../Images/ohmslaw-pi.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

All of this may have nothing to do with unraveling the mystery of the Fresnel <u>pattern</u> hidden in the <u>data</u>, but it is interesting nonetheless, specifically:

- ***α*** is in the same *PP* as *<u>resistance</u>*, *<u>mass</u>*, *DEFINITION* and the first, and only even, prime <u>number</u> of 2.  2 is the only <u>number</u> in these formulas unrelated to &pi;.  In the RZF, the inverse of this prime <u>number</u>,  <IMG src="../Images/math/309.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>, is the only value that returns 0, as in ζ(2 <sup>-1</sup>)=0, or ζ(<IMG src="../Images/math/309.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>)=0.  In the RZF, this value marks the center of the symmetry for all <u>numbers</u> produced by the RZF, natural and complex.  In other words, the <IMG src="../Images/math/309.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> point, not the 0 point, is the pivotal point that mirrors all the values on one side of the <IMG src="../Images/math/309.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> mark and which are reflected on the equal but opposite side of <IMG src="../Images/math/309.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>.  This is relevant because the RZF seems to be very related to the creation of the Fresnel pattern.

- ***β***  is the opposite *PP* of ***α*** and the inverse of ***γ*** and occupies the *PP* of *<u>CONTRIBUTION</u>*,  *current*, *the <u>speed of light</u>*, and the next prime <u>number</u>, 3.

- ***γ*** is defined as <IMG src="../Images/math/310.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>, which is also the result of RZF of the square-roots of all natural <u>numbers</u> greater than 1, which is the sequence of values that defines a Fresnel lens and our distance-delta plots.  That sequence of natural <u>numbers</u> is created by ζ(-1).  The *PP* of ***γ*** is that of *<u>volts</u>* (the amount of <u>potential</u> that exists between two opposing limits) and of *<u>NEGOTIATION</u>* and share the *PP* with 6.

- ***&pi;*** is in the same *PP* as *Power* (electrical),  *<u>Energy</u>*, and the *white-dot* of the <u>tholon</u> where all three points combine to create a 3D tholon.  However, it could also represent the new N-state that is created on the spectrum between ***α*** and ***β*** (or *DEFINE* and *<u>CONTRIBUTE</u>*), as the tetrahedron can not become 3D until the child N-state is created.

- The spectrum of ***α*** and ***β*** where all new N-states appear is also the spectrum between the only two prime <u>numbers</u>, 2 and 3 (6 and 18).

- ***α*** and ***β*** are in the same *PP* as the prime <u>numbers</u>, and the remaining two variables are products of these two numbers.  In this specific case, for the pi-based formulas to <u>work</u>, the value of 2 must be in the *PP* of 2.  (See *Squares and Square Roots* chapter in [Appendix C, “<u>Tholonic</u> <u>Math</u>”](#Appendix-C:-Tholonic-Math_) for more about the miracle of the <u>number</u> 2)

  We also see that ***γ*** equals <IMG src="../Images/math/313.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>, which is the volume of a four-sided pyramid with a base length and height of &pi; (because &pi;<sup>3</sup>/3 = 10.3354255600999).


## The Cornu Spiral

While the manner in which the cross-summed <u>numbers</u> create a diffraction <u>pattern</u> may be a mystery (to me), how diffraction <u>patterns</u> are created are not.  Properly described, it would require a lot of <u>math</u> which we won’t get in to here, but a quick search on “What is the Cornu’s spiral method for diffraction <u>pattern</u>?” will reveal all to the more curious.  In short, because we know that the intensity of light at any point is always proportional to two values known as the *Fresnel integrals* <IMG src="../Images/math/314.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:28pt;"/>, we can plot the intensity of each point along the diffraction <u>pattern</u> on a 2-Dimensional plot.  When we do this, we end up with an amazing figure called the *Cornu Spiral*, shown below as "2D Cornu Spiral (Fresnel)".

Another interesting thing about the Cornu Spiral is that it also describes the path of the sun over the course of the year (from <u>Earth</u>’s perspective)[^201], which is pretty poetic.  It appears as though the Cornu spiral describes not only how light and matter interact in the nanometer scale, but also on the <u>planetary</u> scale, at least in one sense.

Not surprisingly, the Riemann Zeta Function also creates not just one Cornu Spiral, but an entire series of spirals, as shown in “Cornu Spiral (RZF)”, that emerge from nothing and continues to expand from within itself.

The *x* and the *y* values are the result of a function based on a single value, as in *x(t)* and *y(t)* of the Fresnel Integrals, but there can be a third dimension based on *t*.  When this new *z(t)* dimension is proportional to the *x* and *y* dimensions, a cone is created on the z-axis, which might be related to the diminishing angles of the diffraction <u>pattern</u> in the “Slightly zoomed out” plot of the cross-summed <u>data</u> <u>patterns</u> shown above.

<center><img src='../Images/cornu.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

So, by saying the following…

- The Cornu Spiral describes the diffraction pattern.
- The RZF describes a Cornu spiral.
- The RZF is a normalized version of the the Zipf Function.
- The light of the sun hitting <u>Earth</u> creates a Cornu-ish spiral over the course of a year.

… we can relate our mystery <u>pattern</u> to quite a few other <u>patterns</u>, including Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup>, but the most dominant have to do with the <u>nature</u> of light.

In one way, it is like the cross-summed <u>numbers</u> are similar to photons in that it is the individual photons that create the diffraction <u>pattern</u> just like the individual <u>numbers</u> of our <u>data</u> also create the diffraction pattern.  Both of these “particles” (photons and <u>numbers</u>) are presumably following some of the same rules in some fashion if we are to judge them by their resulting patterns.  Given my lack of training in this area, I can only wonder if the wave/particle properties of photons also apply (contextually) to cross-summed <u>numbers</u>, or <u>numbers</u> in general.  Perhaps they are somehow related or similar to *<u>Feynman</u> Sunshine <u>Numbers</u>*, which relates prime <u>numbers</u> and photons, among other things? These are <u>numbers</u> that include RZF values that appear in the description of sunshine as well as ancient relics of the <u>Big Bang</u>, and the theory of photons, <u>electrons</u> and positrons.

## Cross Sum <u>Patterns</u>

It seems useful to say something more about cross-summed numbers.

Cross-summing two unrelated <u>numbers</u> like a carnival numerologist will generate seemingly meaningless <u>data</u>, at least with respect to the quantitative significance of that <u>data</u>, but it will have plenty of <u>information</u> about how each <u>number</u> relates to the others, regardless of the source of the data.  Even with perfectly <u>random</u> <u>numbers</u>, as a cross-sum that is divisible by 3 means the entire <u>number</u> is divisible by 3, and if divisible by 9 then than entire <u>number</u> is divisible by 9.  We all know that if the last digit of a <u>number</u> is 2, then that <u>number</u> is divisible by 2, but it is also true if the cross-sum of the last 2 digits of a <u>number</u> equals 4, then that <u>number</u> is divisible by 4. Testing for divisible by 8 can also be done by cross-sums, but is a bit more complicated.  You join the 2 leftmost <u>numbers</u> and multiply by 2, then add the rightmost <u>number</u>, for example, if a <u>number</u> ends in 464, such as 7464, then 2&times;(**46**)+**4**=96=12&times;8.  Now we know that 7464 is also a multiple of 8, which is the case; 8&times;933=7464.  

10 is obvious, but 11 is very interesting.  If we have the <u>number</u> 5025669, to test for divisibility by 11 we reverse the <u>number</u>, giving us 9665205.  We then do an *alternating* cross-sum like so:  9-6+6-5+2-0+5=11, so 5025669 is divisible by 11 (5025669&div;11=456879).  This is interesting because 11 cross-sums to 2, and we can use the <u>number</u> of places used to test for divisibility as exponents of 2 (2<sup>0</sup>=1, 2<sup>1</sup>=2, 2<sup>2</sup>=4, 2<sup>3</sup>=8).  With these <u>numbers</u>, which is a binary expansion,  we can apply the oscillating functions or - and + to get a final <u>number</u>, and if that <u>number</u> is 11, then the original <u>number</u> is divisible by 11!

Divisibility by 7 is also interesting because it uses recursive cross-sums.  let’s test 371.  We take the rightmost digit and multiply it by 2, then subtract that value from the remaining digits:

37 - (2×1) = 35

The we do that again on the answer:

3 - (2 × 5) = -7;

In all these examples, the cross-summing told us something about the *quality* of the <u>number</u> (what it’s divisible by), regardless of the *quantity* of the number.  Cross-summing is a form of qualitative math.

If we have <u>patterns</u> of non-random <u>numbers</u>, we can use cross-summing to learn of some quality of that pattern.

For example, if we create a list of <u>number</u> that increases by 8, as in 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, etc., and then cross-sum them, as follows:

<center><img src='../Images/by8rotate.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

&hellip;we get a resulting sequence of 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9​ which continually repeats itself.

Our original <u>data</u> was sequential because it was tracking the linear <u>movement</u> of <u>planets</u>, so that means that the progression of values will always represent progressive points on a linear path, with each value being slightly larger (in this case) than the previous value, but when we cross-sum these values, all spacial or temporal <u>information</u> is lost leaving only the <u>pattern</u> of the relationship of the numbers.  For example, 10 is larger than 9, but cross-sums to 1.  Here, 1 represents the *lower octave* (for lack of a better term) of 10.  Cross-summing essentially lowers all the <u>numbers</u> to the same octave.  We see this in the <u>number</u> matrix below (left), as any consecutive sequence of digits will always repeat one of the nine <u>patterns</u> shown in the matrix.  While this removes a lot of quantitative <u>data</u>, it does not remove the relationship between the data.  In fact, it makes that relationship clearer, much like listening to a 10 octave piano piece in only 1 octave.

This <u>number</u> matrix shows the repeating <u>pattern</u> of every sequence of <u>numbers</u> that increases by the <u>number</u> in the left column.  The chart on the right shows the changing progression of each of the rows in the matrix is actually only 6 stages of transformation between the straight line at the bottom (1) and the perfectly ordered line at the top (8).  The line above that (9) are the totals of each line, which also happens to be exactly the same <u>pattern</u> as line 8.  The graph at the bottom shows these same <u>numbers</u> but non-stacked and smoothed, and here you can see the symmetry of the progressive changes.  This example applies to any sequence of integers.

In our example of the series of <u>numbers</u> based on multiples of 8, we have two types of numbers; the quantitative values and the cross-summed values that represent their “position” or relation to other <u>numbers</u> within the context of a base-10 <u>number</u> system.  In the charts below, the top-left chart below shows both of these values as two dimensional.  and also shows how as the quantitative value increases the cross-sum value can decrease.  The top-right chart shows the values of two dimensions plotted as x and y values which shows the that the difference between the diverging values is linear.

Further below, the left chart is a plot of what appears to be un-patterned <u>data</u>, but when we reduce it to one octave by cross-summing, we see a very clear pattern.

The point of this is to demonstrate how there can be hidden <u>patterns</u> in seemingly un-patterned <u>data</u> that has nothing to do with how it exists in time and space.

Attempts were made to replicate the <u>patterns</u> that appeared in the <u>planetary</u> <u>data</u> with various other inputs, such as incremental counting, the <u>number</u> of seconds from some moment, a <u>number</u> and some function of that <u>number</u>, such as square root, but nothing was able to get even close to the Sun/Moon patterns.  This suggests that the Fresnel <u>pattern</u> is not solely an inherent <u>pattern</u> of cross-sums, but is a result of the source data.  If that is the case, could it be possible that the Fresnel <u>pattern</u> is a property of the <u>movement</u> of the Sun and the Moon, or at least two rotating bodies in the same system?

The image above is more fun than informative because it fuels the imagination.  These are two top charts that show 64 samples of the position of the Sun to 14 places.  The values of each place are then plotted as one set of data.  For example, if there are three samples of <u>data</u> of 1.23, 4.56, and 7.89, we plot the 1<sup>st</sup> line as 1,4,7, the 2<sup>nd</sup> line as 2,5,8 and the 3<sup>rd</sup> line as 3,6,9.  Were this a live, real-time plot, we would see the outermost circle (or top-most line), changing thousands of time a second, and the innermost (or bottom) changing every couple of months.  If we plotted time instead of space to 14 places, the outer (or top) would change a million times a second, and the inner (or bottom) would change once every 11 days.  It is very interesting (although probably statistically meaningless) that (in the  upper left image) there is an obvious <u>pattern</u> in the first 6 values, and with the 7<sup>th</sup>, that <u>pattern</u> completely falls apart. 

The bottom 2 images (of image above) are simply a graph where each value is a dot over the course of 3,000 samples.  ~~You’ll notice that the <u>pattern</u> is remarkably identical to the image titled “*Distribution of prime <u>numbers</u> for each of the 53,041 ‘<u>microstates</u>’ of the <u>number</u> 300*” at the end of the chapter titled “*The Thologram*”, where we apply the <u>concept</u> of <u>entropy</u> to numbers.~~

The following above were created by plotting each digit of the position of the Sun.  

- In ***Img. 1***, we begin with the first <u>number</u> at the bottom.  Each subsequent digit is plotted *3&times;number* degrees to the left or right, with even <u>numbers</u> to the right, odd <u>numbers</u> to the left.  For example, the <u>number</u> 9 would be plotted 27 degrees to the left, and the <u>number</u> 8 would be plotted 24 degrees to the right.  The width of the line is relative to the digit’s place, so 1.0 is wider than 0.1 which is wider the 0.01, etc.  The image below, ***Img.  1a***, is the same  algorithm but based on <u>random</u> <u>numbers</u> rather than the Sun’s position, and each new position of the Sun moves down the X-axis.  The purpose of this graph is to visually show the expanding <u>scope</u> that starts from one point.  The <u>reason</u> for odd=left and even=right was to see what <u>pattern</u> we would get if we used the traditional yin/yang and ancient Greek <u>concept</u> that even <u>numbers</u> are yin/female in <u>nature</u> and odd <u>numbers</u> yang/male in <u>nature</u>[^202].  If there was any validity to this then we would expect to see a <u>pattern</u> common in <u>nature</u>, which is exactly what we get.  ***Img.  1b*** is the same as ***Img.  1a***, but where the initial direction of each like the plot is random.
- ***Img. 2*** is similar to ***Img. 1***, except each <u>number</u> is plotted adjacent to the previous <u>number</u> (and the colors were changed, the deviation was lessened, and the length of the plot was slightly shortened).
- ***Img. 3*** is something quite different.  Rather than using the position of the Sun, we used the recurring cross-summed <u>patterns</u> of the sequence of <u>numbers</u> when we increase counting by 1 through 9 (as shown in the <u>number</u> matrix above).  The image below ***Img.  3a*** is that same sequence but with a much larger value so as to see its larger pattern.  Interestingly, we end up with three distinct groups;  1,4,7 (cross-sum=12=3),  2,5,8 (cross-sum=15=6), and 3,6 (cross-sum=9).  The <u>number</u> 9 is all alone by itself and is at the center.

I had placed this simple lens set-up on the roof so the sun would burn a path across a wooden plank as the day progressed. The idea was to collect a portrait of the weather each day. As the work progressed, I noticed that the burn’s curvature was changing with the seasons. We took photos of the burns and placed them end to end following their curvature to see what a year’s worth looked like. The sum of days generated a double spiral figure. At first, it did not make any sense-this primitive lens set-up was producing a complex spiral shape. A few of the astronomers I showed it to said, "Well, it must be coming from somewhere, but we have no idea what it is". Most of the scientists insisted that there had to be some anomaly in the set-up and that the shape had nothing to do with astronomy -just some weirdness in the lens. In reality, it made no difference at all if the lens faced one way or the other as long as it faced generally toward south. The elements of the spiral are in sunlight itself; it was an archetypal image falling from the sky. I finally contacted Kenneth Franklin at the Hayden Planetarium. He directed me to the Naval Observatory, where LeRoy Doggett, an astronomer with the Nautical Almanac office…". Authors note: This Sun Spiral was pieces together manually from many separate samples, and should not be seen as an accurate representation of the suns paths, but only an approximation.
