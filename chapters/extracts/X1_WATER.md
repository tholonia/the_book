## Structured Water

Given how water seems to be such an excellent tholonic medium, can we lower the entropy of water by increasing its order, adding structure in a way that matches and/or enhances the patterns of the thologram and see some differences in how it transmits or interacts with energy? If we notice any differences, we have another piece of potential evidence supporting the tholonic model.

As it happens, there is such a thing as *structured water*.  *Coherent* or *Structured* water, for those who are not familiar with the term, is regular water that has been modified to give it more structure or pattern, specifically in the way that the water molecules are arranged in relation to one another, or so it is claimed.

OK, I know I probably lost some readers with this last sentence.  If you do an Internet search of “structured water”, one of the top results you will get is the Wikipedia entry that begins with “structured water is a term used in a marketing scam”, and although that is true to the extent that anything can be a scam in the hands of scammers, the entry says nothing whatsoever on the legitimate research and testing that has been done regarding the use of structured water.

To the dogmatically skeptical, structured water is just more “swarming” of those heretically perverse “worms”.  However, unless one suffers from a severe case of *scoleciheretiperviphobia* (fear of heretically perverse worms), they can easily find hundreds of papers, dozens of books, and scientific research from highly accredited pioneering professionals and leaders online [^78] supporting the structured water phenomena.  Skepticism has its place and serves a critical purpose, but regarding the extreme skepticism of structured water, that purpose does not seem to be moving understanding forward or seeking new solutions to real-world problems, such as solving global water shortages and increasing crop production, as has been well documented by some of Australia’s largest produce farms.

To see the result of my own tests and how to make structured water, see *Appendix J: Structured Water*.

There is quite a lot of good research on the subject that we won’t detail here.  However, we will look at Fabian Ptok’s Master’s thesis *“Alternative Irrigation Methods: Structured Water in the context of a Growing Global Food Crisis due to Water Shortages”*[^79].  He covers the subject well from an agricultural and food security perspective and provides several references to the research and work in this area.  One of the often cited studies showed dramatic results in decreasing blood and DNA damage in diabetic rats, but this study is also criticized as it was small[^303].  There is also a book by Professor Gerald Pollack, who has an impressive list of credentials[^304] and is available online for free[^80].  I have not read this book, so this is not an endorsement or recommendation, however, some of his experiments and patents[^487] look very interesting.  Dr. Pollack has made no claims about his work, but is raising funding to test his hypothesis that SW can have positive effect on health.

Another potentially trusted source is the work of Marcel Vogel (more on him later).  He claimed that through years of work and thousands of experiments, he was able to prove that various forms of energy, including thought, could permanently change the spectrographic properties of water [^301].  He also claimed that water was an information storage system.  This last claim is especially significant, considering Vogel was not only a chemical and physics researcher at IBM for 27 years, but he was an information medium specialist, holding patents on hard-drive memory technologies that are in use today.

<img src='../Images/116-water-ice.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>Water is an excellent test medium because the structure of molecular water is tetrahedral, and being the most basic shape of creation lends itself to many different tholonic applications.  It’s worth noting that when it was originally suggested that water might be tetrahedral in shape back in 1938, the idea was met with disbelief.  It was not until 80 years later, in 2013, that this was finally accepted as valid.  Today&hellip; 

> <img src='../Images/tetrah2o.png' style='float:right;width:15%'/>“It is widely accepted that liquid water structure is comprised of two closely interweaved components, i.e., tetrahedral and hexagonal structures”.[^81]  

In fact, water, as ice, may be the closest instance of the entire tholonic structure of any other substance (that is common to us).  *(image above from “Tetrahedrality is key to the uniqueness of water”[^82])*

The *silicate structures* of minerals are also quiet similar in that they are made up of tetrahedrons of various arrangements.  The structure of water and quartz is so close that, in some conditions, ice has the same structure as quartz[^302]!  While this was only discovered recently, the word “crystal” comes form the Greek word *krustallos*, meaning both *ice* and *rock crystal*, because the ancients believed quartz was permanently frozen water.  This lends some credence to the metaphysical and ancient idea that water and quartz have a special relationship.

Radical ideas are often met with radical resistance.  Structured water is one of those ideas, falling into the same New Age category as “crystal power”.   Ignoring the 249D crystal that (possibly) created reality, common crystals have some pretty impressive qualities.  

- Generate electricity (piezoelectric).
- Amplify, transmit, and store data (up to 300 million years [^342]).
- Generate signals (used in microchips, watches, internet routers and network controllers, satellites, up to billions of cycles per second).
- Control the transmission and phase of light (liquid crystal displays - LCDs)
- Ability to alter time (yes! They are called *time crystals*, representing a new state of matter, according to MIT.[^343])
- Ability to hold a magnetic charge.

Crystals can do all these amazing things because of the structure of the elements that make a crystal, and water, with its tetrahedral structure, is like a liquid crystal.  As we have stated, energy creates order, and movement is the effect of energy.  Therefore, adding energy via movement to a tetrahedral liquid, such as water, will positively or reinforce its structure.  Being a more efficient conduit for transferring energy, that structure will likewise affect that which interacts with it by transferring more energy.

The hypothesis is that we should see measurable effects simply by causing movement to commercial water (tap or bottled).

In Ptok’s Master’s thesis mentioned above, the author examines various tests that grew different plants using tap water and structured water.

<center><img src='../Images/095-ptolks-images.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One of his findings was that structured water increased alfalfa growth by 15.1%.  This may not sound like much, but in the U.S.  alone, a 15% increase in alfalfa growth represents an additional 20,700,000 tons of alfalfa, which has a value of over 4 billion dollars.  Similarly, some of Australia’s largest produce farms reported needing 25% less water to produce a superior product than traditional water[^478].  In the tholonic model, these examples also apply to concepts, intelligence, ideas, and of course, ideologies, be they scientific, spiritual, or political.

**Review of studies**

There have been several studies of SW using animals.  One review does a meta-analysis of these studies, “*Structured Water: effects on animals*”. [^322]

[^322]: Lindinger, Michael. (2021). **Structured Water: effects on animals**.  Journal of Animal Science. 99. 10.1093/jas/skab063.  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349669391_Structured_Water_effects_on_animals

> This review focuses on the effects of structured water on animals when it is consumed on a daily basis.  Structured water is liquid water that is given altered H-bonding structure by treatment with various forms of energy including magnetic fields and light.  While most of the research has been conducted on magnetized‘ water, which has structure of short duration, recent research has examined effects of a structured water with stability of at least 3.5 months.

**Conclusion**:

>  The animal research conducted to date consistently demonstrated beneficial effects of SW consumption.


<img src='../Images/bullied_plant.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>There is another conclusion that also needs to be looked at, and that is the inability for some people, including scientists, to accept the possibility, or worse, attack not only any finding, but even the question as “worms of heretical perversity!”.  It almost as if science is suffering of *sophophobia* (fear of learning), or worse, *rogophobia*( fear of asking questions). 

An example of this is the very simple “experiment” produced by IKEA (yes, the furniture store), where they placed 2 identical plants side by side for 30 days in many K-12 GEMS schools (Global Education Management Systems[^420]) across the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E).  Signs near each plant instructed the viewer to either “compliment” the plant (right) or “bully” the plant (left).  The short YouTube video[^421] had 1.2 million views, with 6,700 likes and 625 dislikes, and many of the comments were as vile as YouTube will allow.  Granted, this exhibition will never get published in the *Journal for Experimental Science*, but it the clearest demonstration of the concept.  

It is certainly sufficient to raise the question, “Do emotions effect life?” which sounds like a ridiculously silly question, as we all know the answer.  Still, while there are countless studies on the effect of plants on human emotions, there is nary a one (that I can find) on the impact of human emotions on plants.  This is unfortunate, as such a study would tell us a lot about the emotions/biology connection that presumably would have some effect on human’s often emotionally chaotic, fear-driven, culturally distorted minds.  Unfortunately, the anger and dismissive attitudes expressed in the comments of this video are shared by many leaders in the scientific community, which can, at times, acts like a cult of scientism.

# Making and Testing Structuring Water

I personally experienced similar results to those reviewed in the animal studies.  In my own experiments I created SW simply by spinning 1 liter of water with a chemical stirrer in a magnetic field made of 6 equidistant, and opposing, magnets glued to the outside of the water jar, which was about 6 inches at its widest part.  Each magnet (15mm x 3mm NbFeB 42 MGOe) has a strength 2335 *Gauss* at the closet point inside the jug, which drops to 3 *Gauss* at the center of the jar 3 inches from the magnet, and which drops to about 8 *Gauss* in-between the magnets (which are about 3.5 inches apart each. ) These are a bit weak, considering a magnetic field strength of 1000 to 3000 ie required, but the *Gauss*  drops below 1000 after 7 mm inside the jar.  The water is spinning, so all the water is exposed to the stronger fields, but as it is constantly rotating, that exposure is temporary.   

This was the only water I drank for close to a year, and neither my diet nor lifestyle changed in any significant manner during that time.  The difference in the before and after blood tests were compatible with the tests on animals.  My blood panel was generally better regarding cholesterol levels, but the most dramatic change was my triglycerides dropped from 750 to 150.  This is anecdotal, but considering my results matched those of controlled tests on animals, it was enough for me to accept that structured water should be at least be seriously studied.

### Making Structure Water

We look at three ways to create structured water.

Before we get into the techniques, there is an important point to make that is being made here because if you are reading this you have obviously maintained both an open mind and a level of interest that is prerequisite to the following topic.
As we have mentioned, ideas have archetypes, and those archetypes have instances.  One of the archetypes of Ideas is form.  This would then suggest that ideas can alter archetypes of form, which can alter an instance of form.  Tholonically speaking, that is exactly right.  The mere thought of something has some effect on the instantiated form of that thought.

This is relevant to creating structured water, or any creative process, but water seems to be a particularly sensitive medium.  The thoughts you impose on the water have an effect on the water.  While the scientific support for this claim is still being collected, evaluated and debated, from a purely tholonic perspective, it is a valid hypothesis that focusing your awareness on water will have some effect.  Also in accordance with tholonic ideas is that increasing the structure of water will create a better medium for interacting with, energetically.

**Manually**

Vortexing (whirlpooling) water by hand was shown to be effective in improving growth differences in plant tests, but it is not easily applied to larger-scale needs.  It is fairly easy to create a vortex in a container of water some small tubes and a water pump, or a chemical stirrer, which spins a magnet inside the water.

There also does not seem to be one standardized accepted technique to manually structuring water.  One technique that seems to be popular is a homemade version of the same technique used in some of the industrial-sized units, and that is simply using marbles as a water filter.  The reasoning behind using marbles is that the natural structure of water that is reinforced by its movement over and through the terrain, rivers, rocks, trees, etc., is destroyed by being processed, stored in stationary reserves, channeled through pipes, chemically modified,  and a number of other modifiers.  Simply flowing water over and through a marble filter causes the water to form many small eddies as it is constantly divided and reunited, allowing the water to return (closer) to its natural, more structured state. 

People have reported favorable results by simply filling a tube with glass marbles, pouring water in one end and collecting the water on the other end.  The processed can be repeated numerous times or placed inline to a water pump vortexer.  If marbles work, then using the same reasoning, a sand filter would probably work even better.  The Center for Disease Control has an entire page on sand filters (https://www.cdc.gov/safewater/sand-filtration.html).

Anything that forces water to reform itself is thought to have some effect.  Some people say using quartz helps.  Tholonically, this would make sense as we claim that structure is the result order, order is the result of energy, energy has fields and fields have induction.

Magnets have also been used.  Although it may make sense that one could use magnets, no one seems to do a decent job of explaining how they work.  The intuitive reasoning is simply that magnets are fields caused by order, therefore, magnetic fields can induce order.  Some of Australia’s largest produce farms have been using magnetic water with phenomenal results, needing 25% less water to produce a superior product than with traditional water, according to Seven West Media, Western Australia’s leading news service.[^191]

Simple instructions can be found on the web[^192] for making a Hero’s Fountain (named after the first-century Greek mathematician Heron who discovered this process of an energy-free recycling water fountain) that recycles water through a loop.  Fill one of the bottles with marbles, or whatever you like, and when the cycle is complete, you have a bottle filled with restructured water.

[^192]: For example. **Heron’s Fountain Plastic Water Bottle 2 minute DIY no sealant, no glue, **<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92rSXLPupKw>

**Commercial Attachments**

Devices such as the Martin-Wasserwirbler (MW) attachment are small devices that claim to restructure water typically by creating a vortex within the device.  The Martin-Wasserwirbler (developed in Germany) is an attachment that forces the water through a series of vortex-creating channels made of oppositely charged metals.  I am slightly suspicious of this last bit as they say they use silver and gold as the oppositely charged metals, but both of these metals have similar ionization and electronegativity properties, so unless they are doing something to these metals to change that, it’s not clear how they can be oppositely charged.  This is not to say they are not, just that it is unclear.

The MW device was the first device to create structured water and was based on the ideas originally conceived by the brilliant Viktor Schauberger, the Austrian forest caretaker, naturalist, parascientist, philosopher, inventor and biomimicry experimenter, and his son Walter Schauberger, both of whom studied the qualities of water.[^193]

[^193]: More on Victor’s work can be seen in the excellent documentary on YouTube “**The Secrets of Water, The Documentary of Viktor Schauberger / Comprehend and Copy Nature**”, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyOGdjWDVM4>

The idea that the qualities of water lost due to its processing could be reintroduced by creating a vortex within the water was originally brought up in 1972 in a conversation with civil engineer Wilhelm Martin, who was working on ways to improve tap water.  In 1997 Martin published his paper “Experimente mit Leitungswasser” (Experiments with Tap Water)[^194].  In that paper, he describes the Martin-Wasserwirbler (Martin Water Vortex, MWV) and his 30 years of experimentation with the concept.

[^194]: Martin-Fischer-Harthun, “**Experimente mit Leitungswasser**”, 1997. This paper is difficult to find online. The original can be purchased at <https://www.fischer-wirbelwasser.de/shop/buecher.html>

Tests with the MWV have shown positive results, such as a rise in pH, oxygen content, and a decline in water temperature.  Unfortunately, there are no tools that exist to measure many of the qualities of water that we believe are its most important, which is the manner water moves, stores, and transmits energy, including the energy of awareness.

**Industrial Solutions**

Pursanova is a company that makes complete water processing system for residential, commercial and industrial applications.  Their products range from &dollar;20 to many thousands.  They have a number of case studies on their website (pursanova.com) which are astounding.

*Disclaimer: I have no relationship with any of these companies and am not promoting any of their products.  I refer to them simply because my research seems to indicate they are legitimate products in an industry filled with wild and dubious claims.*

Below are the tests I ran myself.  Tests ***(j)*** and ***(k)*** were run numerous times with the same results.  The results showed that the SW had an obvious effect in disintegrating the material faster and more thoroughly.  This would suggest that the SW had lower state of entropy/higher energy potential than the CW.

I suspect this is due to hydrogen bonds which have various lengths, directions, and strengths, and which can change, and even break with kenetic energy and movement.  

We know that formation of hydrogen bonds in water can have large effects on the water’s entropy, and that even small changed to water’s entropy can have a considerable influence[^484].

Hydrogen bonds in water are still a matter of debate in the science community.
