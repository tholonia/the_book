# Part I

Part I of this book introduces the <u>ideas</u> and <u>concepts</u> that form the vocabulary later used to describe the <u>tholonic</u> model presented.  These are not esoteric or niche <u>concepts</u>, but the most fundamental <u>concepts</u> known to <u>science</u>, such as <u>energy</u>, <u>chaos</u>, <u>order</u>, <u>waves</u>, and Newton’s Laws.  As we review these basic <u>concepts</u>, we also expand on them and build new <u>concepts</u> that will be critical in describing what role <u>awareness</u> plays in the theater of <u>existence</u>, how and why <u>consciousness</u> *had* to evolve, and the <u>nature</u> of intelligence; artificial, human, or otherwise.

# 1: <u>CHAOS</u>

###### Everything begins and ends in chaos.

##### **Synopsis:** In the fundamental trinity of <u>reality</u>, that of <u>chaos</u>, <u>energy</u> and <u>order</u>, <u>chaos</u> comes first.  By definition, it exists before any *thing* exists.  It is the engine of creation and annihilation, and the always-present foundation of all existence.  <u>chaos</u> exists across a spectrum that stretches between the 0 of <u>nothingness</u> and the &infin; of somethingness.  This is 1<sup>st</sup> <u>duality</u> of creation from which all that ever was, is, or will be emerges.  

##### **Keywords:** <u>chaos</u>, <u>randomness</u>, <u>pattern</u>, <u>duality</u>, creation, <u>zero</u>, <u>infinity</u>

The Oxford English Dictionary gives three definitions of the word *<u>chaos</u>*:

-   The formless matter supposed to have existed before the creation of the Universe.

-   The formless and disordered state of matter before the creation of the cosmos.

-   A state of extreme confusion and disorder.

<u>I am</u> not sure what the difference is between the first two definitions.  Regardless, we’ll skip over the apparent contradiction of “formless matter” existing before creation&hellip; for now.

Some colloquial, older definitions of <u>chaos</u> describe it as matter before there was any <u>energy</u>, but as we now know that matter itself is nothing but <u>energy</u>, that description no longer applies.

There is also the Ancient Greek mythological definition of the word χάος, *Khaos*, referring to the void state preceding the creation of the <u>Universe</u> or cosmos and personified in the Greek creation myths as the god who was “*the first created being, from which came the primeval deities Gaia, Tartarus, Erebus, and Nyx.”*

In <u>physics</u>, <u>chaos</u> is defined as “*The property of a complex system whose behavior is so unpredictable as to appear <u>random</u>, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions.*”, but as <u>science</u> writer James Gleick points out:[^2]

[^2]: Gleick, J.  (1998).  **Making a New Science**.

> No one [of the <u>chaos</u> scientists he interviewed] could quite agree on [a definition of] the word itself, and so instead gives descriptions from a <u>number</u> of practitioners in the field.  Those scientists that do have a definition are hardly in agreement, as Philip Holmes defined “chaotic” as, “The complicated aperiodic attracting orbits of certain, usually low-dimensional dynamical systems.” while Bai-Lin Hao describes <u>chaos</u> as “a kind of <u>order</u> without periodicity.”

Another term for *<u>chaos</u>* comes from <u>cosmology</u>, and that is the *primal void.*

Modern <u>cosmology</u>’s <u>Big Bang</u> theory is quite compatible with this idea that before there was anything, there was nothing but a <u>primal void</u>, a term often used by cosmologists.  The <u>primal void</u> is a descriptive synonym for at least one state of chaos.

The <u>primal void</u> has also been called the *gap between heaven and <u>Earth</u>*, the *abyss*, *absolute-limitless nothing*, *ex nihilo*, *primordial waters*, and several other terms, all trying to convey the idea of an immeasurable <u>nothingness</u>, a <u>concept</u> that may well be impossible for the mind to grasp.  This <u>nothingness</u> also includes (rather, excludes) the <u>concept</u> of time, as there can be no time in a void of <u>nothingness</u>, at least according to Stephen Hawking.[^3]

[^3]: “**The Beginning of Time**.” Stephen Hawking, <https://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html>.

Everyone from scientists to mystics seem to agree on the rather obvious premise that before there was something, there was nothing, and then, presto, <u>somethingness</u> appeared in the nothingness.  What that <u>somethingness</u> was is still unsettled. It could have been some form of <u>singularity</u> that may or may not have spontaneously appeared and expanded to create the <u>Universe</u>, or some form of <u>energy</u> intense enough to warp space to the point where it became <u>mass</u>, or even some type of multidimensional projection.  In all these theories, and in all beliefs, and speculations, there is the <u>understanding</u> that before there was something there was nothing.

## <u>Nothingness</u>

How “big” was this <u>nothingness</u>?  Is there a limit to <u>nothingness</u>?  If there is, how is that defined?  If there is no limit, then is <u>nothingness</u> infinite?  These may sound like silly questions, but they are actively being researched and debated in the worlds of <u>science</u>, philosophy, and mathematics[^376].

[^376]: Sorensen, Roy. “Nothingness.” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Stanford University, February 28, 2022. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nothingness/. 

First we have to be clear what we mean by *nothing* because <u>conceptually</u> there are numerous types of <u>nothingness</u> (and many types of &infin; as well, possibly infinite).

According to various authorities, there are various levels of nothing, but a good overall <u>understanding</u> which incorporate other’s levels is provided physicist *Sabine <u>Hossenfelder</u>*[^399] who describes up 9 levels of nothing.  Below, we list these 9 levels, their 3 general categories, and the 2 basics <u>concepts</u> or relative and absolute <u>nothingness</u> that that we will be using in this book.

<center><img src='../Images/9levels.png' style='width:90%'/></center>

[^399]: Hossenfelder, Sabine. “**What Is ‘Nothing’?**” Backreaction, September 24, 2022. https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2022/09/what-is-nothing.html. 

What level would “I have nothing in my bank account” be categorized?  Having a measurable <u>balance</u> of 0 puts your absolutely empty bank account in Level 6, and being a measure of the non-physical entity of credit puts it in level 7.  Although being flat broke may feel like absolute <u>nothingness</u>, finances are a value that is derived from physical things and is the transference of <u>energy</u> between things (people, businesses etc.), and could even be considered a “<u>field</u>”, making your poverty a relative form of nothingness.

*Relative <u>nothingness</u>* is contextual.  *Absolute <u>nothingness</u>* has no context because nothing exists to give it context, so there is nothing that can be said about absolute nothingness.  Even calling it *absolute <u>nothingness</u>* is limiting, as the <u>concept</u> of *absolute* implies “*to the largest degree possible*”, which implies size, measure and time, none of which exist in *absolute <u>nothingness</u>*, and just adding words like *super-duper-ultra-unlimited* doesn’t fix this.  Perhaps the only thing that can be said about true <u>nothingness</u> is that there is nothing we can say about it.  In this way, primal, true, or absolute <u>nothingness</u> is synonymous with the *<u>Tao</u>* as described by <u>Lao Tzu</u> when he said:

> The <u>Tao</u> that can be described 
> is not the eternal Tao. 
>
> The name that can be spoken is not the eternal Name. 
> The nameless is the boundary of Heaven and Earth. 
>
> The named is the mother of creation. 

Which is to say:

> The <u>nothingness</u> that can be described 
> is not the eternal Nothingness. 
>
> The nothing that can be spoken of is not the eternal Nothing. 
> The eternal <u>Nothingness</u> is the boundary of all that can ever be and all that is. 
>
> Nothing is the mother of creation. 

If there are (at least) 2 kinds of <u>nothingness</u>, does that mean there are (at least) 2 kinds of dualities?  Yes.  Each of the 9 levels listed exists is some type of <u>duality</u> (except perhaps #9) has a <u>duality</u> of some type, but with only 2 types of <u>nothingness</u>, we refer to only two types of duality; the *primal <u>Duality</u>*, which is the <u>duality</u> of the first *thing* that existed in the *primal <u>nothingness</u>*, and *relative <u>duality</u>*, which is every <u>duality</u> that exists because of, or within, the *Primal <u>Duality</u>*.

We symbolize this primal <u>duality</u> as 1 and 0, and from 1 and 0 all other <u>numbers</u> appear. It might seem more sensible that the primal <u>duality</u> would be that of &infin; and 0, which is also true, as &infin; is a <u>concept</u> representing the totality or <u>unity</u> of all <u>numbers</u> and is not a <u>number</u> itself, while the <u>number</u> 1 *does* represent <u>unity</u>, and is even defined as “<u>unity</u>”.  In this case, which is limited to the context of *<u>unity</u>*, 1=&infin;, or rather, the <u>unity</u> of 1 represents the <u>unity</u> of all, and the mapping the range of  0→1 to 0→&infin; is common in mathematics and computer programming for exactly this reason.

All the dualities that follow the primal <u>duality</u> exist in the realm of *relative <u>nothingness</u>*.  We have names for these relative dualities, such as positive and negative, yin and yang, or any difference that separates *<u>somethingness</u>*.  Measurement of any kind is a byproduct of relative nothingness. This *relative <u>duality</u>* is the <u>duality</u> of our <u>reality</u>, the mundane <u>duality</u> that allows *things* to exist, <u>energy</u> to move, and has states of <u>balance</u> and imbalance.  

Just as nothing must precede something, 0 precedes 1, so we can say that everything starts with 0.  We will be using the <u>concept</u> of 0 and <u>nothingness</u> quite a bit, so let’s review this “simple” and common <u>concept</u> that we use every day.

### <u>Zero</u>

The general <u>concept</u> of <u>nothingness</u> is represented by the <u>number</u> 0, but it was only recently in human history that we could even grasp the <u>concept</u> of <u>nothingness</u>, and even then, its adoption took thousands of years and was hotly debated.  It is officially recognized that 0 was first recorded in Mesopotamia around 3 B.C., but the ancient Indian *Bakshali manuscript*  from 1500 B.C. appears to use the symbol of a dot (&bull;) to represent 0.  In either case, these were followed by 0’s appearance in Mayan Meso-America circa 4 A.D., again in Mayan Meso-America in the 5<sup>th</sup> century, Cambodia in the 7<sup>th</sup> century, and China and the Islamic countries in the 8<sup>th</sup> century.  The <u>concept</u> of 0 didn’t reach Western Europe until the 12<sup>th</sup> century, and even then, was not fully accepted as a legitimate <u>number</u> <u>concept</u> for hundreds of years, which is a bit embarrassing considering that <u>bees</u>[^397], <u>monkeys</u> [^378]<sup>,</sup>[^379]<sup>,</sup>[^380], and crows[^381] have no problem with the <u>concept</u> of 0.  

Similar to Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’ well-known 5 stages of grief; denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance, the adoption of the <u>number</u> 0, according to animal physiologist Andreas Nieder, went through its own 4 stages[^377], which seems appropriate as the <u>concept</u> of nothing, on an existential level, it not unlike death.

- **Stage 1:** Recognition of the absence of something. 
- **Stage 2:** Recognition of nothing vs. something (5<sup>th</sup> c. BC, Greece).
- **Stage 3:** Recognition of 0 preceding 1 (7<sup>th</sup> c. AD, India ).
- **Stage 4:** Ability to assign rules and properties to a symbolic representations (13<sup>th</sup> c. AD, North Africa).

*Note: these dates are best guess estimates based on documented references.*

It’s curious that <u>humans</u> achieved such an advanced state of <u>intelligence</u> and yet never developed the <u>concept</u> of 0.  It’s almost as if <u>humans</u> were gifted the benefits of <u>intelligence</u>, whether via genetic mutation, <u>alien</u> intervention[^387], or psychoactive stimulation[^388],  thereby skipping a critical phase of the long, hard, slow <u>work</u> of <u>evolution</u> to get there.

It is not a coincidence that the modern world and the <u>concept</u> of 0 arrived at the same time, as it was 0 that allowed for the creation of things like modern <u>math</u> and calculus, and this ability of 0 began to eclipse the philosophical objections that you can’t get something from nothing, much to the chagrin of the <u>Christian</u> church which was not very happy that this extremely useful <u>number</u> was being introduced by the Muslims, not to mention that if something can come from nothing, what does that say about god?

### The <u>Complexity</u> of Nothing

0 is challenging enough without the addition confusion that comes from the erroneous answer to 0<sup>0</sup>=1 that many calculators provide (including <u>Google</u>’s calculator.  The correct answer is *0<sup>0</sup>=undefined*).  However, X<sup>0</sup> is always 0 as long as X!=0. Although this may look like <u>math</u> mumbojumbo, it’s pretty straight forward: X<sup>0</sup>=X<sup>1-1</sup>=$\frac{X^1}{X^1}$=$\frac{X}{X}$=1.  In addition to 0 representing nothing, this proof shows us how 0 also represents a state of nothing that *results from something*, as 1-1=0,  or <u>conceptually</u> speaking, *something-something=nothing* .  Hence, 0 is not only the “<u>womb</u>” from which all <u>numbers</u> emerge, but where <u>numbers</u> go when they disappear from context.

I wonder if this is what <u>Lao Tzu</u> was also referring to in the *<u>Tao</u> Te Ching* when he said:

> Yet mystery and <u>reality</u> 
> emerge from the same source. 
> This source is called darkness. 
> Darkness born from darkness. 
> The beginning of all understanding. 

Which is to say (in this case):

> Yet the unknown and the known 
> emerge from the same source. 
> This source is called nothingness. 
> <u>Somethingness</u> born from nothingness. 
> The beginning of all understanding. 

This single <u>number</u> of 0 represents the antithesis of all other <u>numbers</u> just as the idea that all that ever did, does, or will exist, does so because of the zen-like oxymoronic paradox of the “<u>existence</u> of <u>nothingness</u>”.  Countless conjectures and proofs have been written on 0; that it is equal to 1, or to the sum of all <u>numbers</u>,  or to &infin;, or  $\frac{1}{\infty}$   and many and/or all other values.  This is not hyperbole, as these <u>concepts</u> are hotly debated in both mathematics and philosophy.  On its surface, the statement 0=&infin; looks like a senseless statement because 0 is a <u>number</u> but &infin; is a <u>concept</u>, so they can’t ever be equal.  However, 0 is both a <u>concept</u> *and* a <u>number</u> as it has a *quantitative* value of 0 and a *qualitative* value of *<u>nothingness</u>*.  This is similar to how the <u>number</u> 1 has a *quantitative* value of 1 and a *qualitative* value of *<u>unity</u>*.  Of course, all <u>numbers</u> are <u>concepts</u> and most common <u>numbers</u> have well-known qualitative, but the first pair of *<u>nothingness</u>* and *<u>unity</u>* started it all.  It’s worth noting that <u>Parmenides</u>, Leibniz, and other giants in the history of <u>math</u> equate *<u>unity</u>* with &infin; with the argument along the lines of all that *is* collectively defines the <u>unity</u> of <u>existence</u> hence, the <u>concept</u> of 1=&infin;, which leads to <u>concepts</u> like $\frac{1}{\infty}$=1∴1-&infin;=0∴&infin;-1=0∴0+1=&infin;, etc., etc. While these <u>concepts</u> may not <u>work</u> so well quantitatively, as in when <u>balancing</u> your budget, they are fundamental qualitative <u>concepts</u> that have been examined by great minds, from Heraclitus to Hegel.  

The <u>truth</u> is, or rather *a* <u>truth</u> is,  the <u>numbers</u> 0 and 1 are remarkably flexible as they are two <u>concepts</u> that encapsulate the idea of the nothing of <u>nothingness</u> and the totality of somethingness; the two poles that define the arena or spectrum wherein all things exist.  What happens inside this arena?  In a word: *<u>order</u>*.  There is no <u>order</u> in the *nothing of <u>nothingness</u>* for there is nothing to <u>order</u>, and there is no <u>order</u> in the totality of <u>somethingness</u> as there is no form, <u>structure</u>, sequence, etc.  If 0 is the mathematical <u>concept</u> of <u>nothingness</u>, then 1 is the ultimate mathematical <u>black hole</u>, and in that sense, 1 *does* represent  &infin;.  0 and 1 (or 0 and &infin; if you prefer) are two states of chaos.  <u>Order</u> only exists *between* these two states, and it is our <u>understanding</u>, discovery, and invention of <u>order</u> that allows us to know this.

#### **Key 1:** <u>chaos</u> is a state lacking any <u>order</u>, time or energy;  total nothingness;  0.


#### **Key 2:** <u>chaos</u> is a state of total <u>energy</u> and matter; total somethingness; &infin;

## <u>Order</u> and the <u>chaos</u> of 0 and &infin;

It was Newton’s contemplation of $\frac{0}{0}$ that led to his invention of calculus, and while we are taught that equations with 0 or &infin; are problematic and best to stay away from, calculus can prove that &infin;<sup>&infin;</sup>,1<sup>&infin;</sup>,0<sup>0</sup>,$\frac{\infty}{\infty}$,0&times;&infin;,&infin;-&infin; all equal $\frac{0}{0}$ , and yet, even today, we are not sure what $\frac{0}{0}$ actually is.  We can see evidence of this in current research, such as the research of the Chief Editor of of the publication *Causation*, Ilija Barukčić, titled “*<u>Zero</u> Divided by <u>Zero</u> Equals One*”[^367], which starts out with:

>  Objective: Accumulating evidence **indicates** that <u>zero</u> divided by <u>zero</u> equals 1

and concludes with:

> Conclusion: The findings of this study **suggest** that <u>zero</u> divided by <u>zero</u> equals one.

Or, in a paper co-authored by by Ilija Barukčić that appeared in *Journal of Applied Mathematics and Physics* [^368]:

> A solution of the philosophically, logically, mathematically and physically far reaching problem of the division of <u>zero</u> by <u>zero</u> (0/0) is still not in sight.

In addition to this ambiguity, not only can 0 = &infin;, it can equal any number.  That is actually a true <u>math</u> statement (I didn’t just make it up).  In <u>math</u>, when an answer can be many values it is called an *indeterminate* answer, meaning an equation, like $\frac{0}{0}$ , has no single or fixed value that can be determined (even though it looks likes the answer should be 1).  The same can be said for $\frac{\infty}{\infty},\frac{\infty}{0}$,0&times;&infin;, 0<sup>0</sup>,&infin;<sup>0</sup>,1<sup>&infin;</sup>,&infin;=&infin;, as they are all *indeterminate*.  Indeterminism is the equivalent of mathematical <u>chaos</u>, which supports our claim that 0 and &infin; are qualitative representations of chaos.  They are also the only <u>numbers</u> that represent a <u>concept</u> that has no value; 0 being the explicit lack of any value, and &infin; which is a <u>concept</u> the represent the opposite of 0, which can have many different forms but in generally meant to frame all numbers;  represents is all possible values between 0 and &infin;, as in  *0 < positive_numbers < &infin;.*

While the above is a mathematical argument for why 0 and $\infty$ represent states of <u>chaos</u>, we can also use the current definitions of <u>chaos</u> make the same argument.  While we can say that <u>nothingness</u> has no <u>order</u> or periodicity and is therefore chaotic, *<u>chaos</u>* also has another definition that means exactly the opposite, similar to the *&infin;=0* concept.  Take, for example, the study of <u>chaos</u> in the origins of the <u>Universe</u> that was undertaken by Chicago’s Northwestern University physicist Adilson Motter, who concluded that 10<sup>-36</sup> seconds after the <u>Big Bang</u> happened there was a state of *total <u>chaos</u>*.  Do you know what was happening at 10<sup>-36</sup> seconds after the <u>Big Bang</u>?  Everything, and in a temperature of over 1 trillion degrees.  Motter concluded from his study:[^5]

[^5]: Northwestern University.  “**Big bang was followed by chaos, mathematical analysis shows**”.  ScienceDaily.  ScienceDaily, 8 September 2010.  <www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100907171642.htm>
>  “Now we establish once and for all that [the universe] is chaotic.” 

We are not claiming here that the <u>Big Bang</u> theory is correct, but we are asking the question; How can the <u>concept</u> of *<u>chaos</u>* describe the state of the void of total <u>nothingness</u> as well as the state of all matter and <u>energy</u> in the <u>Universe</u>, total <u>somethingness</u>?

The definition of <u>chaos</u> that works for both is *“the degree that <u>order</u> is present in any state”*.  Both extreme states of total <u>nothingness</u> and total <u>somethingness</u> have no <u>order</u>, <u>pattern</u> or periodicity, which is quite compatible with another common definition of *<u>chaos</u>* as synonymous with *unpredictability*.  A more flexible  definition of *<u>chaos</u>* comes from the authors of “*Introduction to Complex Systems, <u>Sustainability</u> and Innovations*”,[^6]which simply states:

[^6]: Thomas, Ciza, et al. “**Introduction to Complex Systems, Sustainability and Innovation.**” *Complex Systems, Sustainability and Innovation*, 2016, doi:10.5772/66453.

> <u>chaos</u> explores the transitions between <u>order</u> and disorder.  An <u>order</u> arises from the ever growing disorder of the <u>Universe</u> - <u>chaos</u> and <u>order</u> together.

But this is still too vague for our purposes because it is more reasonable to consider *<u>chaos</u>* as a spectrum from 0 to &infin;.  More correctly, the spectrum of *<u>chaos</u>* is the inverse of the spectrum of *<u>order</u>* (which is further defined later on), because just as there is no such *thing* as darkness, only a lack of the the *thing* that is is light, <u>chaos</u> is the lack of order.  For this <u>reason</u>, we initially define using a slightly inaccurate definition shown below, however, we will be refining this <u>concept</u> as we continue.


#### **Key 3:** <u>chaos</u> as a measure of <u>pattern</u>, <u>order</u>, and predictability.

<u>Chaos</u> is not the same as randomness.  A <u>random</u> event is *non-deterministic*, meaning it can’t be determined when it will happen because it has no <u>pattern</u>, rule, or <u>reason</u> (that we can discover) and no known immediate cause.  At least that is how we are defining the word as it is used in this book.    It may be the case that the <u>concept</u> of <u>randomness</u> simply exists to label unexplainable events that are actually chaotic in <u>nature</u> but far beyond our current abilities to understand, like a super-chaotic event.  An example of this is from the website RANDOM.ORG, which generates <u>random</u> <u>numbers</u>, but in <u>order</u> to make them more-truly <u>random</u>, they use the atmospheric <u>noise</u> as an input.  That ambient <u>noise</u> is not <u>random</u>, but is chaotic.  Another example is how computer <u>random</u> <u>number</u> generators use electrical <u>noise</u> and heat as inputs to their <u>number</u> generator.  Again, these are chaotic inputs.  

Another way to understand the difference between <u>randomness</u> and <u>chaos</u> is in the value of &pi; (pi).  The value of &pi; is infinite in <u>numbers</u> and the sequence of those <u>numbers</u> is quite predictable using simple <u>math</u>, which is how we can calculate the value of &pi;, but there is no <u>pattern</u> to the <u>numbers</u>, so there is no way to determine the next <u>number</u> based on the previous numbers.  This is similar to how prime <u>numbers</u> can only be calculated as they have no pattern.  This makes the value of &pi; chaotic because the value is <u>deterministic</u> yet produces a series of <u>numbers</u> that appear <u>random</u> and uniformly distributed (a.k.a. *normal* distribution). We say “appear” because there is no way to prove that &pi; is <u>random</u> or *normal*, just as there is not way to prove that the infinite numerical sequence contains every possible combination of <u>number</u> that can ever exist, but evidence suggests that’s *probably* the case[^393].  So, <u>chaos</u> has a <u>pattern</u>, but it is unpredictable, and **<u>randomness</u> has no <u>pattern</u> and therefore contains *every* <u>pattern</u>**.  Here we see an instance of the <u>concept</u> of not only 0=&infin;, but that &infin; exist *within* 0.

> There’s a beauty to Pi that keeps us looking at it...the digits of Pi are extremely random. They have no <u>pattern</u>, and in mathematics that’s really the same as saying they have every pattern.” **~Jonathan Borwein, mathematician**

Depending on who you ask, you can get a <u>number</u> of different definitions of “<u>random</u>”, but the definition we’ll will be referring to is:

#### **Key 4:** A <u>random</u> event is a spontaneous event that has no apparent cause.

Of course, this leaves a lot of room for speculation as to the <u>randomness</u> of an event as there are certainly many cases where we just can’t see the cause.  What appears as <u>random</u> could easily be related to the *<u>butterfly effect</u>*, which states that small changes can have a growing and cascading effect.  This <u>ideas</u> is often exemplified in the question “*Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?*”, which was also the title of a 1972 talk[^392] given by <u>Edward Norton Lorenz</u>, a mathematician, meteorologist, and founder of <u>chaos</u> theory.

While this is a bit of an aside, it is a fascinating piece of history and an excellent example of the *<u>butterfly effect</u>* in so far as how it can affect <u>society</u>, and how a candid meeting of two strangers in a ball in Prague in 1896 would be responsible for <u>World War I</u> and World War II.  

<img src='../Images/sophie.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>The two strangers were Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand and Sophie Chotek, a duchess and the daughter of a Bohemian Count, who met, fell in love, and got married. The problem was, Sophia, being a mere duchess was not royalty, and given royalty’s strict adherence to their self-aggrandizing customs, is was forbidden that she appear next to the Archbishop in any official royal ceremonies.  The Arch Duke may have loved Sophie, but he was still an obedient autocrat, and so he followed the rules.  However, this meant he *was* allowed to have her by his side during non-royal ceremonies, such as when he was acting as the Inspector-General of the Austria-Hungarian Army.  Taking advantage of this loophole, he decided to show off his wife to the world by taking a public trip to inspect the Bosnian army with his wife by his side. To ensure everyone saw them together, they traveled in an open car for all to see.  It was during this public demonstration of his undying love that the Serbian nationalist, Gavrilo Princip, ran up to the car and shot both of them at point blank range, killing them instantly.

<u>Austria</u> was outraged, demanding an apology from Serbia.  <u>Serbia</u>, while denouncing the assassinations, refused to apologize stating they had nothing to do with the plot.  <u>Austria</u> responded by declaring war on <u>Serbia</u>, which forced treaty-bound Russia to ally with Serbia.  Germany, who was treaty-bound to <u>Austria</u>, declared war on Russia, causing France and Great Britain to come to Russia's aid.  <u>World War I</u> devastated Germany, which laid the fertile ground for the rise of nationalism and <u>Hitler</u> which resulted in World War II.

All of the death and <u>destruction</u> of these wars was a consequence of a chance meeting in a ball, plus countless other *butterfly effects*, such as Gavrilo stopping to buy a sandwich which happened to place him at the right time and place, and every other interactions that has ever taken place since the First Cause started the show.  But such stories are deceptive because it takes away from the inconceivably profound realization that every trivial act is also a result of everything that has ever happened since the beginning of time. Yes, it’s quite possible that WWI would have happened in any case, but in this timeline of history, this is what *did* happen, just as you may not have spilled your drink if you hadn’t turned your head because you heard weird sound, but you did because everything that has ever happened since the beginning of time was leading up to that moment.  This may sound like there is no such thing as “free will” but we won’t get into that now as it is addressed towards the end of the book.

One of the classic “truly <u>random</u>” events in the <u>Universe</u> is <u>radioactive</u> decay, but only the decay of a single atom.  As a group, the decay is quite predictable, which is how we calculate half-lives of <u>radioactive</u> material.  This is the same as saying we know that there is a 1 in 366 chance of getting into a car accident on a 1,000 mile car trip, but it is impossible to predict the who, when, or where of any one particular accident.  Insurance companies try to minimize the odds with reams of <u>data</u> on the probabilities on accidents regarding teen drivers, aggressive drivers, weather, speeding, impaired driving, driver error, distracted driving, etc., which narrows the ranges, but still can’t predict one accident.  Still, this does not make the individual accidents random.  If Sally gets drunk because she just got fired for aggressive behavior and she decides to drive home from the bar in a snow storm while arguing with her husband on the <u>cell</u> phone and going 30 miles an hour over the speed limit, and she gets into an accident with Bob, there is nothing at all <u>random</u> about that, nor is there anything <u>random</u> about how Bob’s car was where it was when it got hit.  Both Sally and Bob were on a path that was the result of a series of chaotic events (i.e. <u>life</u>).  Each event increased or decreased the probability of an accident.  In Sally’s case, those events clearly created a high probability scenario for an accident.  Bob, on the other hand, being a careful driver who was paying attention and was going slow, had a very low probability of an accident, yet he got hit anyway.  We would say this was a <u>random</u> event (“<u>bad luck</u>”) for Bob, but a highly predictable event for Sally.  In this scenario, “<u>random</u>” means an unpredictable yet <u>deterministic</u> chaotic system (Bob’s <u>life</u>) that influenced another unpredictable yet <u>deterministic</u> chaotic system (Sally’s <u>life</u>).  Because neither system is predictable, it is impossible to predict when or if they will interact, thus, “<u>random</u>” is synonymous with “theoretically unpredictable” as this <u>random</u> accident was the effect of a cause created by the intersection of 2 chaotic systems.  

A more common example of this is the idea of a stock market.  The price of a stock is unpredictable, but it is not truly <u>random</u>, as the price is determined by the individual actions of the thousands of buyers and sellers, each one of them making non-random decisions based on their own financial interests (i.e. cause/effect chains).  Each of these chains is a systems in and of itself, and all these systems combined form the larger system of a stock market.  

<img src='../Images/L-sys-2.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>Chaos is *deterministic* because it adheres to rules, and even has a pattern, but the effects over time create unpredictable results.  chaos does not happen in one moment.  It happens over time, and what happens next depends on what happened before, making chaos a self-similar, or self-referencing, process.  Because it is *change* that happens over time, there are two components to consider; a *growth factor* and a *limiting factor*.  For example, in the image to the right, we start with a simple pattern that never changes but can replicate itself in its children, and after 10 generations it turns into a tree.  The *growth factor* is that it is self-generating, and the *limiting factor* is the fact that all of the variables (length, angle, color) are permanently fixed.  Popular real-world chaotic systems are things like the weather, economics, growth patterns, etc., but in actuality, everything that grows, moves, or has energy moving through it has elements of chaos in its system that is influenced by millions of variables forever changing.  

Below are some diagrams to help make this <u>concept</u> clearer.  

<center><img src='../Images/L-sys-3.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

**Row A:** The top-left, shows the changes to a simple form where a line will have a line half the length extend from it at 20&deg;.  This new extended line will then also have a line half its length extending from it, and so on.  The top-right image is the same <u>pattern</u>, but with 90&deg; instead of 20&deg;.  They are side-by-side to show how the natural form of plants is the same <u>pattern</u> as a now-common man-made grid pattern.  Why is that significant?  Because this grid <u>pattern</u> was adopted as a way to grow and expand new territory more efficiently which is why it was adopted by the architects of the New World in the 1700s.  It was <u>Thomas Jefferson</u> who first used this <u>pattern</u> to ‘gridify’ the entire country so as to make it easier to expand into.  City planners found the same <u>pattern</u> to be far more effective than the more organically formed cities of old Europe.  The major driving <u>force</u> behind this <u>pattern</u> was financial, of course, and it’s no surprise that this efficient form of development appeared and grew in parallel with the industrial revolution and the radical expansion of city populations, such as London, which grew 600% from 1775 to 1885.  We see this same <u>evolution</u> of <u>patterns</u> in <u>biology</u>, such as grid <u>cells</u>, which are the <u>cells</u> that allow us to navigate our environment and which form a triangular grid with their impulses.  It may seem like a stretch to claim that the industrial revolution, capitalism and suburban roads are just another instance of the same <u>patterns</u> that determine tissue growth and the stripes of a Zebra Fish, but that is exactly the case[^330].  The only difference is the context in which these <u>patterns</u> are being applied and the resources at hand.

**Row B:** The middle row shows the simplest of all forms, the triangle.  In this case, a new line is always created at the end of the previous line, but rotated left 120. At the end of that child line, a new parent line is created but rotated in the opposite direction (whose child will also rotate right, and so on).  In the left image, all variables remain the same.  In the middle image, the deviation was allowed to wander 1&deg; in either direction.  In the right image, the deviation was allowed to wander in any direction.  These images represent the three states of order; perfect and unchanging, transitioning, and total chaos.  

This is also an example of an instance of a relative duality.  While the prime <u>duality</u> is that of primal <u>nothingness</u> and primal <u>somethingness</u>, a relative <u>duality</u> is that of a relative <u>nothingness</u> and a relative somethingness.  In this case, the relative <u>somethingness</u> are the lines formed by the rule and the relative <u>nothingness</u> is where there are no lines.  Together they create a perfect form (according to the rules); in other words, an archetype.  It is perfect because the rules are perfect.  When we add a small bit of imperfection of 1&deg; (or 0.27%) of <u>randomness</u>, the form is no longer perfect, but still identifiable.  With 100% of <u>randomness</u>, it is total <u>chaos</u>, a perfect mess.  This is an example of the path from <u>order</u> to one type of <u>chaos</u> (the path from <u>chaos</u> to <u>order</u> is addressed in the chapter on <u>energy</u>).

**Row C:** Because <u>chaos</u> is <u>deterministic</u> (but appears <u>random</u>), whatever a chaotic system does, it will do exactly the same way every time if all the variables remain the same.  In our world, these variables are dynamic, so there will always be some change to some variables.  This is why all <u>pine trees</u> don’t look identical.  The row shows five instances of the 5<sup>th</sup> generation of the same source <u>pattern</u> where slight variations in length and divergence were allowed.  This is meant to demonstrate that while growth is a chaotic system, <u>evolution</u> is a chaotic system with some amount of <u>randomness</u> in it, for without those slight variations, nothing would ever change.  <u>Reality</u> expands in <u>chaos</u>, but evolves in randomness.  At least that is the premise we start from because <u>random</u> events can exist within the <u>chaos</u> of change, but the <u>chaos</u> of change can not exist in a <u>random</u> event, and the <u>Universe</u> is certainly a system of change.  

When looking at these images, keep in mind that these are only 2-dimensional <u>patterns</u> of 10 or less generations from its starting point with only length and divergence changing slightly.  In the 3-dimensional world we live in, the starting point from which all form descends is the beginning of existence.  The variables and generations at any and every moment since the beginning of time are countless, and the change in the variables range from minuscule to dramatic.  The impossibility of accounting for all the details necessary to make a prediction of a chaotic system is why it is unpredictable.
