# 3: ORDER

###### On every scale of existence, order arises out of chaos and then returns to chaos.  Each cycle of existence can take millennia or nanoseconds.

##### **Synopsis:** Introduction of *Tholonic Model*, a model of reality built on both new and well-established concepts.  All that exists between 0 and &infin; is an expression of energy.  Numbers represent the distribution of that energy and describe order, and order is a function of perception and understanding.  Order has scope and hierarchical dependence, and each scope has its own laws and natural measure.  Chaos is the baseline state of existence, and the order that arises does so to more efficiently return to a state of chaos.  David Bohm’s *implicate/explicate* theory sheds light on the relationship between the appearance, or “relativity” of order and chaos.

Everything that exists must follow the laws of existence, for the penalty of not following those laws is non-existence.  This is why we call it the *Laws of Physics* and not the *Highly Recommended Suggestions of Physics*.  These laws of physics can change between one state or scope of matter and another, so before we look at some of the laws, let’s look at the scopes that these laws must function within and some of the concepts we use to understand them.

## The Definition of Numbers 

Numbers is the language of these laws, so let’s start there.  One way to think about numbers, in general, is to imagine *value* as a conceptual form of energy, and a particular value, like 1 or 2, is an instance of that concept.  This should not be too difficult as this is pretty much a description that even Platonists (*“numbers are non-physical, non-sensible things that exist in an objective realm beyond time and space”*) and Nominalists (*“numbers don’t exist outside of abstract man-made concepts”*) would agree on.  This is not a new idea, although it’s an idea that comes more from psychology and philosophy than mathematics[^385].  As concepts are energetic, they follow the laws of energy and have stable and unstable patterns.  The concept of *numbers* is one such stable pattern that emerged from the stable patterns in nature we can observe and includes a number of sub-concepts, such as *real*, *rational*, *whole*, *natural*, *irrational*, and more, each with their own set of laws and definitions.  From the tholonic perspective, it does not matter if the Platonist’s or Nominalist’s theories are correct; all that matters is that the concept of *number* exists and that these concepts represent instances of energy, because everything that exists, from things to ideas, are instances of energy.

[^385]: Marshall, Oliver R., “**Toward a Kripkean Concept of Number**” (2016). *CUNY Academic Works.* https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/703

We start with 0, *nothingness*, which, as explained earlier, also creates the concept of *somethingness*.  We can represent all instances of *somethingness* with the non-numerical symbol of &infin; or *unity* of the system that contains all somethingness as 1.  This *unity* can be the *unity* of a bag filled with 12 oranges or the *unity* of the Universe.  This is the first polarity, 0 and 1, *nothingness* and *unity of all somethingness*. 

Energy always moves in one direction, the path of least resistance, the most efficient path, resulting in a more balanced state. 0 and 1 represent the most imbalanced state that can exist.  How will this become more balanced? The next numerical concept after 1 is 2, because with the values [0,1] we can create the values [0,1,2] with the the 3 combinations of 0+0, 1+0, and 1+1.  But how does 2 create a more balanced state between 0 and 1?

<img src='../Images/harmonic-shell.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>The only way 2 can balance the energy between 0 and 1 would be if 2 represented half of the value of 1, or 1&div;2, or $\frac{1}{2}$.  Of course, there is still an opportunity to create more balance with the next value that can be created with the 9 combinations of [0,1,2] that creates 5 unique values of [0,1,2,3,4].  Of this new set, the smallest possible value greater than the last value of 2 must be used, according to the laws of energy, and that value is 3.  Now we have $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$.  Again, with [0,1,2,3] we have 16 combinations that creates 7 unique values of [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] of which the smallest new value is 4, giving us $\frac{1}{4}$.  This goes on forever, and what we end up with is a series of values called the *harmonic series*, $0,1,\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{5}\frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{7}\frac{1}{8}...$ (right image, left side).

The harmonic series is a fundamental pattern in nature and of music.  No doubt, this is the idea behind the Pythagorean concept that “Physical matter is music solidified”, or the Sanskrit *Nada Brahma*, “Existence is sound” (literally “god sound”), or the legends of Native Americans, Judeo-Christians, Hindu cosmology, Egyptian, Aboriginals, Mayans, Norse, and many other cultures that have a story of sound shattering the void of nothingness.  Imagine the progression of numbers as the harmonic series $\frac{1}{1}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{4}$, rather than the typical progression of 1,2,3,4, (or what could also accurately be written as $\frac{1}{1}\frac{2}{1}\frac{3}{1}\frac{4}{1}$), is consistent with concepts of how energy is distributed and conserved and shows numbers as an *internal expansion* of energy that begins with the initial all-encompassing concept *unity*.  In our numbers-as-energy thought experiment, the number 1 represents the largest value and contains *within* it all numbers.  If there is a finite amount of energy in the Universe, then the entirety of that energy can be represented as 1 quantity, or 1 unit, of energy.  This would then imply that it is the *division* of that 1 unit of energy that accounts for creation.  That division, or at least one fundamental pattern of that division, will be the natural harmonic patterns of energy as shown in the harmonic series, the music of the Universe, literally and figuratively.  We find the harmonic series of $\frac{1}{1}$ &rightarrow; $\frac{1}{\infty}$ in the energy patterns of nature and the Universe because numbers *do* represent energy.

#### **Key 10:** Numbers represent energy and the number sequence represents the balancing of energy and the creation of all things.

We don’t count in fractions, we count in whole numbers, but the difference between whole numbers and fractions is how we compare *unity* with the *parts of unity*; $\frac{whole}{part}$ vs. $\frac{part}{whole}$.  If we want to know how much of the *whole* does a *part* account for, then we divide the *whole* by the *part*, but if we want to know much of the *part* does the *whole* account for, then we divide the *part* by the *whole*.  As we humans, and all things, are *parts* of the *whole* of the Universe, we can only consider the *parts*, as we have no concept of *the* whole other than it is a *whole*, a *unity*, 1 *existence*, that all things have in common, so $\frac{2}{1}\frac{3}{1}\frac{4}{1}$ becomes 2,3,4.

#### **Key 11:** From a Universal perspective, numbers only get smaller.  From an individual perspective, numbers only get larger.

## The Definition of Order

*Order* refers to the arrangement of things.  Those things can be objects, patterns, sequences, ideas, methods, or anything that can be defined.  We typically think of *order* as some type of structured, organized pattern, but these are types of *order* of which there are many, such as random, chaotic, linear, to name just a few.  If we consider chaos to be a spectrum from 0 to &infin;, then we can also consider *order* to be the inverse spectrum of &infin; to 0.  This would be similar to how we measure light or heat.  We don’t measure the cold by how much cold there is but by how much heat there is because cold and dark represents a lack of energy, and we can only measure the absence of something by how much of that something exists.  If something has no energy, it simply does not exist.  No energy is total nothingness.  It is the same for order, but where energy exists as different types, such as light and heat, order exists as different types, such as random or linear.  The lack of order is not *nothingness*, as there is still energy, but it is chaos.  In this way, chaos/order is an instance of the archetype of nothingness/somethingness.  The comparison of energy to order is not just metaphorical, as *order* requires energy, or more accurately, energy produces *order*. 

Does that mean everything has *order*? To some degree, yes, because for something to have 0 *order*, it would also have to have 0 energy, and if there was 0 energy, it would not exist.  We that says then that anything that exists, exists somewhere on the spectrum of *chaos/order*.  The challenge is determining the type and degree of *chaos/order*, and towards that end, we have discovered and invented many types of chaos and order, with many more to come.

#### **Key 12:** Everything that exists has energy, therefore, has some type of order.

#### **Key 13:** Order is a measure of energy.

We use the term “order” quite liberally, even to describe things that have no apparent or even provable order, such as in “chaotic order” or “random order”.  If everything has *order*, then the word becomes meaningless.  Traditionally, “order” refers to a discernible pattern, while the more post-modern view of “order” refers to “the way things are”, synonymous with “arrangement”, ordered or not. 

So what do we really mean when we say something is *ordered*? The tholonic view of *order*, in practical terms, refers to how predictable something is, and this predictability is the result of our level of understanding of that thing.  This makes *order* more of a perception than a description.  Guppies[^391], honeybees[^382], hyenas[^383], dogs[^384], and numerous other animals have some abilities to recognize *order*.  A 10-month-old baby can recognize *order* among 3 items, and a crow’s ability to recognize the *order* of process is equal to that of a 7-year-old human, but none of them could solve a Rubik’s Cube because their understanding of *order* is limited. *Order*, then, is also a measure of understanding.

#### **Key 14:** Order is a measure of understanding and exists to the degree that it is perceivable, definable, and predictable.

Chaos precedes order, just as our *lack* of perception and understanding precedes our perception and understanding.  This would be pretty difficult to argue with, which is why we can say:

#### **Key 15:** Chaos precedes order.

This is not to say that chaos and order are only defined by the limits of our perception, but that our definitions of them are.  Nor is this a claim that there is no such thing as chaos, only order yet to be perceived, but we do claim that, as chaos precedes order, it is chaos that is the baseline of reality and creation as it is the most energy-efficient, most sustainable state, and that order must be one state or condition of chaos as order is less sustainable than chaos.  Order is, with respect to chaos, a temporary state. 

**What does “sustainable” mean?**

Before we go on, let’s agree on what *sustainable* even means, as that concept will come up a lot.  Unfortunately, there are many different definitions for the word, especially with the growth of ecological awareness, which has come to dominate the term.  Intuitively, the meaning of *sustainability* seems clear and obvious, but what does that mean technically? The simplest definition that applies to all contexts is “the state of some thing or some process that coheres, disintegrates, or is destructive to its environment or context”.  This clearly applies to environmental concerns, but how does it apply to things like atoms, planets, and concepts? On a purely material level, sustainability deepens on the fields of force that attract and repel.  Things, from atoms to planets, are held together by these internal force fields as long as the force of these fields are stronger than any external force fields from their environment. 

#### **Key 16:** Sustainability is the result of a balance between internal and external fields of force.

When we are talking about systems within systems, which is how our reality is put together, we are also talking about the chaos and order within each of these systems.  Every *system* has a *scope*, which can be its limits, range, reach, field, horizon, capacity, structure, or other terms used to indicate where that system begins and ends in various contexts.  The scope of a container is in what is can contain, how much it can contain, how long it can contain it, and so on.  The scope of water is anywhere there is water in any of its forms.  The scope of the Sun is wherever the energy of the Sun reaches, how long it will last, etc.  For the record, in the world of quantum physics, everything that we can know about a system is described by its wave function.  This is called the *wave-function postulate*, and the wave-function (symbolized as *psi*, &psi;) of any system has limits, and those limits define the scope of a system.

The scope of a system is also defined by the order of a system, or rather, by where that order breaks down within the system.  Newton’s laws of Motion work fine until things get too big, small, hot, cold, or fast, at which point those laws begin to falter because the order of reality begins to change in those zones that lay at the outskirts of the order of reality we exist in.

For example, imagine you are 1 mile tall.  You can see perfectly ordered patches and circles of corn crops.  As you shrunk, that order would be less and less visible, but you would begin to see the order of rows of corn stalks.  As you continue to shrink, you would lose sight of the corn crops, but begin to see the order of the plant, then the cells, then the molecules, then the atom, then the quarks, then the preons, then &hellip; nothing, I suppose, as preons are the 0-dimensional conceptual points that create quarks.  The same applies to what you would see if you grew larger and larger, passing through the solar system, the galaxy, the multiverse, and finally… ? 

Another example might be how we destroy the order of a tree to create the order of lumber.  All that was the part of the order of the tree comes to an end, and the order that is created by the lumber, such as a chair, comes into being.  These are 2 scopes of order that do not overlap, but they are both children of an order that remains in both tree and lumber, such as the structure of wood (cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin).  This tells us that the order of lumber and trees are subsets of, or dependent upon, or within, the structure of wood.  When that wood is burnt, its order and the order of anything that is within its order, such as a desk or tree, disappears via pyrolysis, or thermal degradation, and the hydrocarbons are broken down to carbon dioxide, water vapor and carbon (ash), each of which abiding by the order within the scope it now exists.

You can easily imagine the never ending series of *chaos $\rightarrow$ order $\rightarrow$ chaos $\rightarrow$ order $\rightarrow$ chaos $\rightarrow$ order* &hellip… 

For this reason we also claim:

#### **Key 16:** Order precedes chaos.

True random events may be the exception, as a truly random event doesn’t follow any rule, pattern, or reason.  By this definition, it’s likely that nothing in nature is truly random, but it’s probably safe to say that there are *apparent* random events that *do* follow currently unknown rules, patterns, and reason.  This makes it impossible to prove anything is random, and that’s even if we ignore Gödel’s *incompleteness theorem* which proves that it is impossible to prove any absolute truth, only truths based on unprovable assumptions.  For this reason, we’ll be avoiding the concept of randomness for the most part in this book, but we can say that:

#### **Key 17:** Randomness can create chaos, but chaos cannot create randomness.

## The Scope of Order

Some laws are *universal*, and some are *local*.  However, what we are calling *universal* may well be *local*, but in a much larger context that we cannot see beyond.

An example of a *local* law might be the *Standard Model* of particle physics that describes the relationship between 3 of the 4 fundamental forces and the elementary particles that make up the matter in our universe.  This is a set of laws and constants that apply to particle physics.  You don’t see this model replicated in larger systems because the model only makes sense when dealing with the reality of sub-atomic particles.  Likewise, Oort constants only apply to the rotational properties of the Milky Way.

Science calls the scope of our everyday Newtonian reality *Macrorealism*[^8] or *Local Realism*, and the subatomic scope is called *Quantum Mechanics*.  Understanding how different laws operate in different scopes is an area of intense research and has led to such landmark experiments like:

- **Bell’s inequalities**: The math that enables the distinction between two different views of reality, typically the relativistic view vs.  the quantum view.

- **Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox**: The speculation that every particle in the Universe knows the state of every other particle in the Universe at all times and that no two particles in the Universe have the same state.

- **Leggett-Garg inequality**: The claim that in the quantum world something can be in two states at the same time, which is impossible for the macroscopic world.

...  to name a few.

#### **Key 18:** Local laws and constants are valid only within the context of their scope.

An example of universal laws or patterns that span many scopes might be the Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377&hellip;) and its constant ratio of Phi (φ), also called the *Golden Ratio* (1:1.618).  This number is the ratio that not only pops up in galaxies and sea shells but, according to some evolutionary and chemical scientists[^9], is the ratio that keeps all of existence in order and is the shape of space-time itself.

<center><img src='../Images/003-phi-shell.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Another universal law might be simple fractal math formulas that have a form like *f(x)= x<sup>2</sup>-1*, which can be found across all forms of existence[^10], suggesting that self-similarity is a universal property. *Power laws* explain how a relative change in one measurement can result in a proportional relative change in another (e.g., logarithmic or exponential), and we see these across all levels of existence. 

An example of *proportional relative change* can be demonstrated with a line, which we’ll call *L*, that is 1 inch long.  Doubling its length gives us a line that is 2 inches long, or *L &times; 2*, or *L &times; 2<sup>1</sup>* When the line defines a square, doubling its length create an area that is *L &times; 4*, or *L &times; 2<sup>2</sup>* .  In a cube, the volume becomes L &times; 8, or *L &times; 2<sup>3</sup>*.  If the line defined something that was 4-dimensional, like a hyper-cube, then the “volume” of that hyper-cube would be *L &times; 16*, or *L &times; 2<sup>4</sup>*.  So, by doubling the defining element of a line, we see exponential growth in the size of whatever the line is describing.  This is “how a relative change in one measurement can result in a proportional relative change in another measurement”.

These universal laws can be found in astronomy, physics, biology, meteorology, cosmology, mathematics, economics, and many other areas, including society, wealth and work distribution, competition, media exposure, and much more.

Another universal law might be Benford’s law, which is the pattern that describes the chances of what will be the first digit of a number that naturally appears, such as lengths of rivers, populations, and numbers printed on the first page of a newspaper.  This might sound odd, as simple logic would suggest that the chances of, say, the number 1 being the first digit in a series of numbers would be 1 in 9, but that is not the case.  About 150 years ago, it was discovered that the number 1 is the first digit 30% of the time, while the number 9 is only about 5%! In the two images below, we can see this law in action when we plot the populations of every county in the U.S.  and then count the first digit of each of those populations.

<center><img src='../Images/bensonslaw2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This is because, while we may count in a linear fashion, 1,2,3,4,… etc., nature distributes itself in a logarithmic fashion.  For example, let’s say we have 3 naturally occurring scales; 0 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000.  With each new scale, we simply add a 0.  There are 10 numbers in the 1<sup>st</sup> scale, 90 in the 2<sup>nd</sup> scale, and 900 in the 3<sup>rd</sup> scale, but as far as nature is concerned, each scale has an infinite number of divisions, so they are effectively the same from nature’s perspective.  This is how we discovered (or why we invented) logarithms; to replicate the *natural* way numbers work (and why we call it *natural logarithms*).  The image below shows these 2 scales.

<center><img src='../Images/scalar.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Logarithms allow us to multiply simply by adding.  For example, the log of 10 = 1, and the log of 100 = 2, so instead of multiplying 10&times;100 to get 1000, we can just add 1+2.  This gives us 3, and because we are using the normal base 10 system, we convert these log values back to normal values with 10<sup>3</sup>, which is 1000. 

Once upon a time, before the invention of digital calculators, and after its invention in 1859 by a French artillery officer, every engineer had a *slide rule*, which allowed them to do this multiplication-by-adding (and more) simply by sliding some rulers back and forth.

<center><img src='../Images/sliderule.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

How does this apply to 30% of all our numbers beginning with a 1? Because the occurrence of any number as the 1<sup>st</sup> digit is the log of the next number minus the log of the number.  So, the chances that the value of 1 will be the first value in a random list of numbers is *log(2)-log(1)=0.30*, or 30%/ For the value of 9, the chances are *log(10)-log(9)=0.045*, or 4.5%. 

The point here is not to get into the math but to show that nature’s concept of scale, or scope, is *invariant*, meaning nature treats all the scopes or scales the same, so we would expect to find laws in one scale equally applied to all scales.

## Appearance of Order

<img src='../Images/CMB.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>A good visual example of how these laws (in this case, oscillation and entropy, which is discussed at length in the next chapter) affect our perception and understanding of chaos and order is in the distribution of the energy that fills every corner of the Universe.  This is known as *cosmic microwave background radiation*  (CMBR).  The left image (of the right chart) shows the CMBR filling the known Universe with ~2.64 K of heat (-269.51 C&deg;, about 4&deg; C above absolute 0).  The energy is widely dispersed, has no pattern, and is a perfect example of chaos.  It may actually be perfect chaos, which is why some scientists are proposing to use CMBR as a natural source of random numbers[^386] (as true random numbers are extremely difficult to generate).  But, to see this natural chaos, a major correction had to be applied to adjust for *red-shifted* and *blue-shifted* effects due to our galaxy hurling through the Universe at about 1,497,600 miles per hour which make anything we are heading toward look *blue-er*, and everything we are heading away from look *red-er* (due to the compression and expansion of the wavelengths of light).  The way we *actually* see this omnipresent chaos is shown in the right image.  The only factor that accounts for the difference between the appearance of chaos and order is the movement of our galaxy.  It is through this movement that chaos *appears* as order. 

Can we say that if something *appears* to have order then it *has* order? In this case, the chaos remains chaos, and the apparent order is the result of the laws of interaction of energy.  We can say that about anything, as where there is no movement, there is no energy, and where there is no energy, there is the *chaos of nothingness*. 

#### **Key 19:** Movement creates order.

The CMBR is considered the smoking-gun evidence of the Big Bang[^11], which is the scientific explanation of when the *chaos of somethingness* met the *chaos of nothingness*.

#### **Key 20:** Movement creates chaos.

## Order of laws

Even though there are many, many classes of laws, for this writing, we are only going to use these two general scopes of laws, the *local* and the *universal*, because no matter what laws may exist, they will fall into one of these two scopes (or children of these scopes).

Local laws may be local, but they can affect everything that is built upon them.  Everything is made of atoms, and atoms are the size they are because of *Planck’s constant*, which is the relationship between the mass and the frequency of the particles that make up an atom.  If that constant were to change, the entire Universe would be radically different, if it even existed at all.  If Planck’s constant was to increase by only 2.5%, the size of Earth, its spin, gravity, and the density of the atmosphere would all increase.  If it was 2.5% less, Earth would shrink by 20%, its rotation would increase, gravity would lessen, and much of the atmosphere would disappear.  If Planck’s constant changed from 6.2618&times;10<sup>-34</sup> to 6.2618&times;10<sup>-20</sup>, the radius of an atom would go from being microscopically small to being 100 times the distance to the nearest star!

On a more realistic level, consider a bridge made of bricks.  If the laws that bind molecules together change such that they have a lesser negative charge, then the bridge would melt on a warm day.  The (relatively) *universal* Newtonian laws did not change; only the *local* laws changed on the particle level. 

It’s logical that the laws of particle physics affect everything that exists because everything is made of particles, but that does not make the laws of particle physics *universal* in scope, rather, that which is made of particles is *dependent* on the laws that operate in the *local* particle scope, thereby making the effects of local laws farther reaching than their domain.

**Key 21:** Local laws can alter everything that descends from or depends on them.

## The State of Order

It is these laws that create order out of chaos and chaos out of order.  That order exists between the two states of zero-energy chaos and total-energy chaos, but even within the chaos, we can find clues of order as neither a *zero* or *total* state of chaos is possible in the material domain, just *closest-to-zero* and *closest-to-total* states. 

One theory that sheds light on new thinking about chaos and order is David Bohm’s *Implicate Explicate theory*.  In short, Bohm describes this theory by stating:

> In the enfolded (or implicate) order, space and time are no longer the dominant factors determining the relationships of dependence or independence of different elements.  Rather, an entirely different sort of basic connection of elements is possible, from which our ordinary notions of space and time, along with those of separately existent material particles, are abstracted as forms derived from the deeper order.  These ordinary notions, in fact, appear in what is called the “explicate” or “unfolded” order, which is a special and distinguished form contained within the general totality of all the implicate orders. **\~Bohm, “Wholeness and the Implicate Order”**

To demonstrate this concept, we can use an ink droplet analogy.  In this demonstration, we place three drops of ink into a cylinder of glycerin.  The cylinders are then turned, which mixes the ink droplets together.  Reversing the spin of the cylinders then reconstructs the ink drops.  When the ink droplets are in their original form, at the beginning and the end of the spinning, they are *explicitly* ink droplets and have the *order* of ink drops.  When they are mixed up together, they are *implicitly* ink droplets only, and their order would be considered more *chaotic*.  The order of the ink drops has been destroyed, but the information of that order exists as a *virtual* ink-drop, an archetype only, within the chaos of their mixed state.[^12]

In practical terms, this theory says that when something exists in the physical world, it is in an *explicit*, or *unfolded* state.  To exist in this state, it must conform to a set of rules that define the archetype(s) of the form it will take.  When it does not conform to these rules, it still exists, but only in an *implicit* or *enfolded* state, a state we cannot see or interact with (under normal circumstances).  This sounds similar to the “sea” of potential or unmanifest wave functions that collapse into form.  This state has its own rules as well but they are a super-set of the *explicit* rules, making a *thing*, or physical reality as we know it, just one sub-state of a *thing*, or reality, it can be in.

It is these local and universal laws that cause form to *unfold,* to *explicate* itself, self-organize, form patterns and move in accordance with these laws.  By the same token, these laws will also *enfold* or *implicate* these forms, causing them to return to an unrecognizable state, but even in that unrecognizable state, they are contributing to or affecting other yet-to-coalesce implicate patterns.  Depending on the form and the medium, and under certain conditions, one can imagine how the past (that which is enfolding) and the future (that which is unfolding) can affect each other and in both directions.

Here is another example that perhaps better displays the idea.  Below are four pages that started out as identical.  To each page were added some random dots, but *within* a narrow region of a circular line; however, none of those dots stood out from the page’s original random dots and were in no way identifiable as *special* dots.  As we merge the pages, the randomness gets denser and denser until all 4 pages are perfectly aligned, and those extra random dots can easily be seen as a circular line.

The circle is *implicit* in the random dots of each separate page and *explicit* when the pages line up together in the proper manner.  In this example, the *local* pattern would be the random pattern on each page, which represents the scope, and the *universal* pattern would be the parts of the circle as it exists on every page.

All of this addresses the relationship between instantiation and context, in that how something comes into existence and how it is expressed is dependent on the context and scope of where it is being expressed.  This concept is not only a technical or scientific one but also a philosophical one that we can see in Buddhism as the principle of *Pratītyasamutpāda*, which means *dependent arising*, and which states that all phenomena (*dharma*) arise in dependence upon other phenomena (*dharmas*).  More than that, it also implies that the significance of something is defined by its environment.  An obvious example of this is how the same wooden ball falls in the air, is motionless on the ground, and rises in the water.

Now we can continue on the subject of energy.
