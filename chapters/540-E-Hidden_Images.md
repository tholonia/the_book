Another excellent example of hidden images is the the popular (or at least it was popular in the 90s) “Magic Eye”.  These are stereoscopic images that combine two perspectives together which consequently hides the embedded image.  By slightly crossing your eyes, which creates 2 images in your brain, then slowly merging them together (which may take some practice), an image will magically appear when they are properly aligned.  In the image below there is a butterfly.

This technique also allows you to instantly see the slightest difference between seemingly identical images.  You can try this yourself at https://thequizimpossible.com/spot-the-difference.

You can also try this in general patterns you see in everyday life, or even where there is no obvious pattern.  In Carlos Castaneda’s Master Thesis in Anthropology (and an immensely popular book in the 70s), “*The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge*” (considered a work of fiction by many), the Yaqui shaman Don Juan explains to Carlos that the way to know where to go, to sit, or to understand that which you can’t see is to simply cross your eyes and look “in-between” the illusions of the physical reality.   This may sound irrational, but imagine going back in time to the 60s, before such images could be created by computers, and claiming you could see a butterfly.
