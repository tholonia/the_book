# Appendix X: Indexes

###### More of a conceptual meta-data overview

What follows are the indexes of the book.  The 1<sup>st</sup> index is order by words, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> index if ordered by work but within their categories.  

These categories are:

- **Archetypes**: These are concepts of knowledge and understanding; *numbers, atoms, balance, chaos, &hellip;*.

- **Energy**: Concepts that are used to understand energy; *force, movement, thermodynamics, &hellip;.* 

- **Instances**: the material expressions of a ideas, concept, definitions, or archetypes; *asteroids, the Algonquin tribe, brain, &hellip;*

- **Models**: Paradigms of understanding; *alchemy, medicine, parasitism, aliens, biology, &hellip;*

- **Order**: Laws, processes, and phenomena that define, create, or expose order; *cycles, entropy, Fourier transforms, intelligence,&hellip;*

- **People**: Any name name that appears in the body of the book is listed here.

How some concepts are categorized may be debatable, but this is their current state.

The indexes are meant more as an overview of the concepts covered in the book with in indication of their weight (as indicated by their page numbers), and also to provide an easily perusable list of the many different topics that are covered.
