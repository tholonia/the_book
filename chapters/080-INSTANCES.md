## Archetypes

An instance of an archetype can only exist within the limitations of its context.  That context can vary wildly, and there can be a lot of discussions as to what defines a context.  For our purposes, a high-level definition is that a context is defined by the *innate* limits it imposes, and we define *innate* as that which is inherent in the archetype before it is instantiated.  For example, the concept of a car has the innate property of being a ground transportation vehicle because that is how it was designed.  Its very structure is specifically intended to be a functional, efficient, ground transportation vehicle before any parts were assembled.  The same is true for animals and plants.  Certain social constructs may be applied to the instances of these archetypes, such as the Western idea that black cats are bad luck, or the Eastern idea that pigs are good luck, or a car being used as a home, but these constructs are outside of the concept, or archetype, of something.  This is the case for gender as well, as men and woman are innately different and are formed from conception to perform differently according to their respective archetypes.  There *are* social constructs that apply to gender, but one can not change gender by adopting these constructs anymore than a Honda Civic can become a Porsche 911, no matter how much body work is done to it.  The relationship between context and concept is recursive and embedded; context applies limits to concepts, and concepts alter the context, such as how the context of gravity is a limitation to flying, but the concept of air travel changed that context, which then changed the concept of air travel, etc.  In the world of biology, context is (usually) a force of evolutionary pressure.  In the mechanical world, context is the limits of a material.

In the physical world, these limits are usually obvious.  In the conceptual world, less so.  What are the limits of ideas and concepts?  One limit is its definition, which is necessary before it can even be considered a concept.  Another limit is in how it is understood, which is a limitation of the abilities, awareness and neurology of the conceiver.  Aristotle and Einstein both had theories that described the Universe as finite and spherical, but these two concepts were radically different.  Another great example of this is how August Kekulé, a German chemist and one of the founders of modern organic chemistry, fell asleep during a symposium on the subject of benzene in 1890 and dreamt of atoms whirling around until they formed an *ouroboros*, a snake devouring it’s own tail.  The *ouroboros* is an ancient and mystical symbol that represents the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth, the passage of time, the completion of effort.  The symbol shows the serpent nourishing itself by devouring itself.  Historically, the serpent is a symbol of the god of creation (Africa, Americas, China), immortality, resurrection (Egypt, Celtic, Americas),  wisdom (Celtic) and the bearer of good, evil, knowledge, and wisdom (Greek).  In short, the serpent feeding on itself represents the immortal soul’s endless journey of growth in the cycle of of life and death, creation and destruction.  

<img src='../Images/kekule.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>From this vision, Kekulé discovered the benzene ring.  The context of this concept was the mind and awareness of Kekulé, and the limiting factor was that, being a chemist and only interested in carbon bonds at that moment, what he got out of his vision of the eternal cycle of life and transmigration of souls was that six carbon atoms form a ring.  One has to wonder why such a profound symbol would have even enter Kekulé’s mind, given the countless other symbols that could have worked just as well.  Kekulé’s discovery advanced molecular biology, but he had no idea that 100 years later, the molecule of his vision would result in a “miracle material” that would revolutionize energy, medicine, electronics, food, even sports; a material that weighs almost nothing and is 200 times stronger than steel, and a material that acts as an interface between biology and technology.  This material is *graphene*, and it will not only change the world, but is will also change the very biological structure of our being as it is already at the core of the emerging trans-humanism.  If any compound was worthy of such a profound vision, it would be graphene.

From the tholonic perspective, archetypes have an existence of their own, a direction, and even an intelligence of their own (not to be confused with our human concept of existence and intelligence).  Kekulé did not create this dream, as modern psychology would claim, rather, the archetype itself advanced its cause *through* Kekulé.

The current understanding of an archetype is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as:

> The most typical or perfect example of a particular kind of person or thing.

When we speak of archetypes in the context of tholons we are using a more general, yet compatible definition that an archetype is:

> A pattern that expressions of energy diverge from and/or converge towards.

<img src='../Images/arrow_of_time.png' style='float:right;width:45%'/>These patterns are not necessarily limited to 3 (or less) dimension.  They can be, and often are, multidimensional patterns of which we can only perceive 3 dimensions of as they pass through our reality.  The classic example of this is the well-known “Flatland” metaphor[^349] Imagine what you would see if you were a 2-dimensional person living in a 2D world and a 3D object passed through your 2D reality.  You would see a series of 2D slices of that object that changed over time.

[^349]: Abbott, Edwin A. (1884). “**Flatland: A Romance in Many Dimensions**”. New York: Dover Thrift Edition (1992 unabridged). p. ii., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland

Now imagine you are a 3D person living in a 3D world (which should be pretty easy to do) and a 4D object passes through.  You will see 3D “slices” of this 4D object over time as it passes through your 3D world.  For example, if a 4D ball passed through a 3D world it would first appear as a very tiny 3D ball, and then grow to a large ball, then shrink to a small ball before disappearing.

In both 2D and 3D cases, you are not getting the whole picture, but in both cases what you are getting is completely true and valid for the scope of your 2D or 3D reality.

The complete multidimensional thologram, with all its potentially infinite iterations and generations, would look like a perfect tetrahedron in our 3D world.  Like in the example of the 4D ball, a 4D thologram, being itself a tetrahedron, would first appear as a small tetrahedron, which is what we, and others, are claiming all reality is conceptually built from.

Why is this detail important?

The 3D model of the thologram is a 3D slice of a multidimensional concept.  What the larger multidimensional object that we see as a tetrahedron actually looks like we can’t say, and probably can’t know.  What would an 8D or 248D “object” appear as in this 3D world? It could appear as many, many different things.  Take a look at all the ways a simple 1-generation-only self-similar 3D tetrahedral pyramid can appear in 2D orthographic projections.  In this way, one archetype can instantiate, be perceived or understood, in many different ways.

<center><img src='../Images/074-tetraisos.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Now imagine the same tetrahedral pyramid with trillions of generations and many more dimensions! What *wouldn’t* it be able to describe? Its perspectives would effectively be infinite to us, but at its source, it is one thing.

### 2D example

<img src="../Images/leaves-abc-pre.png" style="float:right;width:35%"/>The images below are a good example of how one archetype is expressed through different contexts.  The archetype is based on the simple model previously described and shown in the diagram on the right. We begin with a 0-dimensional point.  This point moves into the 1-dimensional space, which creates a line. In the figures below, we show this initial line as the (black) horizontal diameter of a circle.  The radius is 90 units, which is equal to the number of degrees that are required to best describe a 2-dimensional plane. This 1-dimensional existence of a line then moves beyond the 1-dimensional space and into the 2D space by rotating itself. That movement will be expressed in the 2 dimensions of *x* and *y*, just as the 0D dot that became a 1D line was expressed in the single dimension of *x*.  This means there will be a movement along the 1D *x*-axis, and an equivalent movement along the 2<sup>nd</sup> dimension of the *y* axis, which is accomplished via rotation, as rotation is the most efficient way to create a continuous 2D space from a 1D point (and why a circle/sphere is the most efficient continuous shape).  Because we are rotating around an originating 0D point, that point will remain the center point.  

To illustrate this, we will move the horizontal diameter line 5 units to the right, and rotate it around its center point by 5&deg;. These new lines are shown in red in ***Fig. 1***.  Now we see that this line is off-center. Where before, as a horizontal line, there were 90 units on the left-of-center and 90 units on the right. Now it is 85 on the left and 105 on the right.  It continues its journey into the 2<sup>nd</sup> dimension by moving another 5 units to the right and another 5&deg; rotation, and it continues to do this until the line returns to its starting position of being horizontal. ***Fig. 1*** also shows where the center point is for each line (as yellow dots).  The images that follow are instances of this archetypal pattern.

<img src="../Images/leaves-abc.png" style="width:100%"/>

What is interesting about this shape is how it so perfectly describes the archetypal shape of many things, from leaves, fruits, and seeds to number theory, fractals and even the human brain and pineal gland.  The reason this is interesting is because we have described a very simple model that we would expect to see in nature, and because this model can make successful predictions we can say there is a valid hypothesis.  Perhaps this same reasoning is why the ancient Sumerians thought Earth was egg shaped, and not perfectly round, as the Greeks imagined (in fact, Earth is an oblate spheroid).

Some details worth noting:

- Every shape begins (emerges, evolves, or grows) from a point of 0-dimensional nothingness into a 1-dimensional space, and from there into a higher dimensional space.
- Each expression in a dimensional space will utilize all available dimensions; i.e. if given the nature and scope of an instance that it will move *N* units, then in a 1-dimensional space it will move *N* units in one dimension. In a 2 dimensional space it will move *N* units in 2 dimensions, etc. In our example, our line is moved 5 units in a 1-dimensional space.  In a 2D space it moves *x* by 5 units and *y* by 5&deg;.  In a 3D space it would move *x* by 5 units, *y* by 5&deg;, and *z* by  5&deg;, etc.
- The point of origin (0D point) remains the center point around which something instantiates, but its location in the lines delineates a boundary that has significance.  The 0D point is the archetype of the child points.  The 0D point defines the parent shape, and the child points define a child shape.

<img src="../Images/heartsilp.png" style="float:right;width:25%"/>*Historical footnote: The silphion plant is also a similar shape, similar to the strawberry, but with an interesting historical and cultural footnote as its shape is the origin of our traditional heart symbol.   As well as being known to cure many ailments, it was a natural contraceptive, and so was associated with love and passion. This plant was worth its weight in silver, which is why the Romans kept 1,500 kilos of it in the treasury as a hedge. Coins were minted with the image of the silphion seed, which had the same shape. Sadly, that particular variety was farmed into extinction, with the last known stalk given to Emperor Nero, as the legend goes.*

For the sake of completeness, here is what the lines look like when they complete a full 360&deg;:

<center><img src="../Images/ruler-circle-07.png" style="width:60%"/></center>

### Revisiting Dimensions

If we are dealing with multidimensional archetypes, then let’s look at dimensions of a tholon.  To specify the location of a tholon within the thologram we have to identify each tholon by an address based on its generation.  This is an example of the dimension of *location*.

<center><img src='../Images/076-dimpath.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

If we wanted to reference one specific tholon, such as the one highlighted in the image above, we’d need to say it was located at 1,3,2,1 from the top, or it is the 1<sup>st</sup> child of the 2<sup>nd</sup> child of the 3<sup>rd</sup> child of the 1<sup>st</sup> tholon from the bottom.  The areas blacked out are virtual tholons which don’t really exist (energetically) so we can’t navigate to them even though we can reference them.  So, in this example, we need 4 dimensions to define the location of a tholon.  Any dimension would have to record the path taken to arrive at any particular tholon.  The reason this is being mentioned is to show that each generation of tholons increases the dimensionality of the thologram by one dimension.

For example, to identify the position (P) of one tholon at the 45<sup>th</sup> generation, we would need a dimension that looked something like:

<center><img src='../Images/pequals.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

But it’s even a bit more involved because this dimension only points to one particular tholon within which is its own 3D space. In the thologram, we can’t use a Cartesian coordinate system (i.e.  X, Y, Z) because that would require a coordinate system that extends past the boundaries of existence, and we know that there can be no metrics in nothingness.  We can only use a *quadray* coordinates (e.g.  A, B, C, D) which are based on a tetrahedron, to identify a point *within* the tholon.  

Does this mean that our 3D reality is embedded within a parent 3D reality? According to the thologram, yes, although I have no idea how this can be tested.  An analogy we have to this idea of a 3D reality within a 3D reality is VR (virtual reality), where we can create countless 3D worlds within our own 3D reality.  Another analogy is how a hologram can create a 3D space from a 2D surface, and there can be many 3D spaces on top of one another recorded in that same 2D surface.  These analogies that are used to describe this tholonic concept are similar to the previously mentioned Black Hole Big Bang Theory (BHBBT), which states that the Big Bang was actually a singularity from matter from a parent Universe collapsing into a black hole, creating a new child singularity i.e. entire universes within black holes within universes, within black holes, etc., or, embedded self-similar universes.

### Synergetics

<img src="../Images/ishago.png" style="float:right;width:40%"/>What some people today call *sacred geometry* our ancestors simply called geometry.  Contrary to what we learned in school, geometry is as much a study of philosophy as it is a study of form, space, and mathematics.  Plato, Pythagoras, Parmenides, and a number of other great philosophers were well-schooled in geometry, but the marriage of philosophy and geometry goes back even further in history, and across every culture.  Take the quadray coordinates system as an example. This system is based on 60&deg;, which comes from the 360&deg; (60&deg; &times; 6) model of a circle.  One could make a case that the Ancient Mesopotamian base-6/60 number system, which gave us the 360&deg; circle, was an early version of this idea.  In fact, one could make the case that the 20,000-44,000 year old *Ishango Bone* of the upper paleolithic era discovered in the Congo was the earliest version of a base-60 system.  This bone is considered to be the first instance of the concept of the number one.  On this bone are counting marks, 60 marks on one side, and 60 marks on the other side.  One has to wonder if 60 wasn’t chosen for a reason beyond what we might traditionally imagine.

*Synergetics* is a modern-day example of how geometry forms the basis of the structure of creation, life and how everything interacts with each other.  Buckminster Fuller coined the term *synergetics* in his three-volume work “*Synergetics.  Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking,*”[^70] wherein he explains how using a 60&deg; coordinates system can explain both physics and chemistry, but more importantly, he believed that it also explained reality.  In his words:

> Since physical Universe is entirely energetic, all dimension must be energetic.  Synergetics is energetic geometry since it identifies energy with number.  Energetic geometry employs 60&deg; coordination because that is nature’s way to closest-pack spheres.

[^70]: Fuller, R. Buckminster, and E. J. Applewhite. “**Synergetics. Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking**”. Macmillan, 1975.The entire book can be found online at <http://synergetics.info>

He explains how the points and the lines of a tetrahedron (60&deg; coordinates) describe all elementary phenomena.  Moreover, he claims that synergetics can measure our experiences geometrically, and how we can employ geometry regarding both metaphysical and physical knowledge.

The math of synergetics, according to Fuller, “*works omnirationally, energetically, arithmetically, geometrically, chemically, volumetrically, crystallographically, vectorially, topologically, and energy-quantum-wise*”[^71]. In addition, it is quite compatible with the empirical world where all atoms are made of tetrahedrons, octahedrons, rhombic dodecahedrons, and cubes.  One clever engineer from the Dublin School of Technology hypothesizes that thermodynamics and space-time could be unified with quadray coordinates[^308].  It is worth noting that each of the geometrical shapes that Fuller claims all atoms are made by can be made with the tetrahedron.

<img src='../Images/083-3cubeprob.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>The thologram, which is based entirely on the tetrahedron and synergetic quadray coordinates, is a model of knowledge, thought, and ideas.  It’s important to remember that the map is not the territory.  These models of reality are like maps that describe the terrain.  There are elevation maps, density maps, road maps, water maps, contour maps, temperature maps, population maps, economy maps, crime maps, San Francisco even has human feces maps! They all describe the same territory from different perspectives.  The thologram is one of these perspectives, but even this one perspective can be seen in a number of ways.  How many ways are there? I don’t know, but the extremely simple *three square geometry problem* (“what is the total of the angles *α*, *β*, *γ* ?”) has 54 possible solutions, and that is just with three simple squares (the answer is 90&deg;)!  As you can imagine, there is virtually no end to the relationships, patterns, rules, etc., that can be discovered.  

What separates knowledge from *apophenic* delusions (“apophenia” is the tendency to perceive connections and meaning between unrelated things and is considered a sign of early-stage schizophrenia) is whether a relationship, pattern or law can be tested to achieve predictable results.  On the other hand, we don’t want to fall victim to *randomania* either (“randomania” is the unofficial term for people who attribute to chance that which is clearly the result of order; the inability to see patterns where they actually exist.  I suspect this disability is also a sign of some sort of mental illness).

> It doesn’t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are.  If it doesn’t agree with experiment, it’s wrong.  **\~Richard Feynman**

We agree with Mr.  Feynman, but we also have a broader definition of “experiment”. Reality is reasonable by default, otherwise, it would not exist, but it is not always quantifiable, and often incompatible with current science.

### Types of archetypes

The 2D images of the “*Examples of contextual instances of a simple pattern*” (above) show a fundamental pattern of growth, so we might call this a *dynamic archetype*.  The archetype of a circle is the ideal expression of the rule “the locus of all points are equidistant from a central point” might be called a *transcendental archetype* because it would take an infinite number of lines to make a perfect circle.  The 5 Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron) are *static archetypes* because they are defined by their faces and vertices only, not by any type of *process*.  Jungian archetypes might be called *character archetypes* as they apply to the personification that tends to represent what Jung called a “primordial image”, and it was this understanding that led Jung to the ideas of *anima/animus, the self, the shadow*, and *the persona* but also shed light on the classic archetypes such as *wise old man, the child, the mother, the maiden*, etc.  This was later expanded to *Neo-Jungian* archetypes such as *caregiver, explorer, jester, rebel, citizen, hero, lover, sage, creator, innocent, magician,* and *sovereign*.  Not surprisingly, these twelve archetypes are similar to those found in astrology.  This is because Jung, who incorporated a number of alchemical and esoteric theme into his work, recognized astrology as a system of archetypes, adopting and reforming many of its concepts into modern psychology.  

Everything, all of “that which is”, has an archetype which falls somewhere in the grand ontology of all archetypes.  We understand the world through these archetypes even though they do not represent the reality of the instance of these archetypes, the things themselves.  If I say “apple” you understand when I mean, but “apple” says nothing about the reality of any individual apple.  While this makes concepts easier to share and communicate about, it also hides much of the yet undiscovered reality of that concept.  This is because we can only form concepts based on what we know, but what we know is always limited.  It used to be common for things to have a “spirit”, which was a concept of a general archetype of a thing that included more that its observable qualities.  It was not only the idea of a perfect instance of some thing, but also the energy of that instance.  While the concept of “spirit” still exists today, it would be rare to hear science refer to the spirit of the apple because “spirit” has been removed from the modern Western ontological vernacular; it no longer exists in the hierarchical spectrum of “all that is”, but only as a vague, undefined, poetic reference to a vague, undefined, poetic understanding of life.  This is how language defines our perception of reality.  A shaman may not know anything about the DNA of roses, but he may understand a lot about the spirit of roses. Who can claim to know more about the “truth” of the existence of roses? The scientist or the shaman?

Tholonic instances are easier to understand when we look at isolated archetypes.  It is easy to understand a square block is an expression of an archetypal cube, but what of a melting snowball?  At what point does it stop being an expression of a sphere?  From the tholonic perspective, never.  The snowball came into existence as a result of many tholons (weather, terrain, gravity, etc.) cooperating and competing, exerting forces and limits in such a way that a snowball could form.  The snowball changes form as these tholonic forces change due to waxing or waning circumstances that tend to reinforce some forces and diminish others.  Each of these tholonic forces is an archetype because each tholon *is* an archetype.  As these archetypal forces change, interact, negotiate, compete, the resulting form will always be the most efficient expression of the state of those forces.  In other words, everything that exists is as perfect an expression of its archetypes that is possible in the context of its existence.  Everything that exists is made up of many, many branches of tholons or archetypes, so what we see is an amalgamation of countless archetypes that have managed to create a stable instance in a specific context.  

The melted snowball is still an expression of a perfect sphere, but just a very diluted or weak expression given the strength of the other forces that have turned it into a puddle.  One way to think about this is to imagine each archetype as having a field of influence (which they do, and which is explained later) similar to the way each planet has a gravitational field, or how each electron has a electron field, both of which stretching to the edge of the universe. Right now you are primarily under the influence of Earth's gravitational field.  You are also under the influence of Jupiter's gravitational field, but it is too weak to have any *observable* effect.  If you were to move closer to Jupiter, its effect would become more apparent.  

Imagine each archetype as having some level of entropy, similar to how the entropy of Earth gravitational force is very low, and the entropy of Jupiter's is very high (for us on Earth).  Similarly, the archetypal force of a sphere is very low when the water is in the form of a snowball, but very high when it is a puddle.

Our snowball-turned-puddle is just less influenced by the “field” of the archetype of *sphere* and much more influenced by the “field” of the archetype of *puddle*.  Each of these fields is defined by the archetype that is a composite of the other archetypal forces that created it.

Some of these amalgamations of archetypes will become archetypes and parents of archetypes themselves.  Perhaps the only pure, unamalgamated archetypes that exist are the concepts of *something* and *nothing*.

So, when you see something that looks imperfect, think of it as perfect, it’s just that you are not aware of all the archetypal forces that are making it the way it is.

#### **Key 66:** Everything that exists *must* be perfect.


## Examples of instances

### Quarks

<center><img src='../Images/087-tholo-quark.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here is another example of how we might discover tholonic structures in subatomic particles.  Let’s look at a quark (which was originally named a *parton* by Richard Feynman to describe a hypothetical particle inside the nucleus of the atom).

Currently we understand that protons have a charge of +1 and are composed of 2 *up* quarks, which have a charge of +2/3 and 1 down quark, which has a charge of -1/3, and neutrons have a charge of 0 and are composed of 1 up quark and 2 down quarks.  

<img src='../Images/fig-q1.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/fig-q1a.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>This is seen in a single complete tholon which consists of a *real* tholon (proton) and it *virtual* reflection tholon (neutron) as shown in ***Fig. q1*** and ***Fig. q1a*** below.  The upper trigram has a parent trigram at the top which we can assign a value of -1/3, and the two children can be assigned a value of +2/3.  The center child trigram, which is always a reflection trigram, has a value of 0.  The opposite is true for the lower reflection trigram as well.  With these values, the upper tholon has a charge of 1, like a proton, and its reflection tholon has a charge of 0, like a neutron.  This also seems to indicate that a truly complete tholon requires two tholons; itself and its reflection tholon. It’s worth noting that the simplest and first element, hydrogen, is the only stable element that does not have a neutron (*heavy hydrogen*, or *deuterium*, has 1 neutron and is stable, and the radioactive *tritium* has 2 neutrons).  

If you remember the X, Y and Z coordinates of a tetrahedron, as shown in the previous chapter, you might remember that the 4<sup>th</sup> point of a tetrahedron, the *white dot*, has the coordinates of **0, 0**, $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}$ , the N-state was  $\sqrt{3}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ , and the 2 points that creates a new N-state were $\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}$.  Compare these to the charges of a proton of $\frac{-1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}$.  The Cartesian coordinates of a *real* (as opposed to *virtual*) tetrahedron are proportional to the charges of a proton.  Yes, this may simply be a “coincidence”,  or a property of *thirds*, or the result of some as yet unknown relationship, such as how the spiraling of galaxies, the female to male population in bee colonies, and the branching of the *sneezewort* plant are based on the same ratio of 1.618 (phi), but it is more reasonable to start with the idea that the tetrahedron, the conceptual building block of reality, and quarks, the actual building blocks of reality, follow the same rules.

<img src='../Images/fig-q1a.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/fig-q1.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>***Fig. q1a***, which is the folded 3D version of ***Fig. q1***, is also the same shape as the quartz *trans tridymite* silicon oxide molecule, with the N-states holding the same position as the  silicon atom.  For those playing along, note that the *trans tridymite* molecule has oxygen molecules that total the atomic number of 32 and the silicon molecules totaling 28, resulting in a total atomic number of 60.

<img src='../Images/fig-q3.png' style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>***Fig. q3*** is from the previously quoted paper on the *E8 Lattice* that explains the various models within the E8 crystal and describes this shape as “representing all 8 components of the electron”.  This is not exactly the same as what we are saying here, but in a different order, which supports the overarching idea regarding tetrahedrons and subatomic particles.

### Subatomics

<img src="../Images/4FOL2.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>To summarize, the foundation of all of creation lies first in the three basic patterns created by the tholonic matrix.  All three patterns are redundant, but only one (yellow hexagrams) is self-similar or fractal, and this is the only pattern that supports the N-states. For this reason we assume that the yellow hex grid exists *between* the other two grids, an an N-state comes into existence *between* two poles.

<img src="../Images/fig-h1.png" style='float:left;width:50px'/><img src='../Images/spacer.png' style='float:left;height:40px'/>You’ll notice that in ***Fig. h1*** (from the previous chapter) the lines of succession from N-sources to N-states exist across all 3 directions.  We also saw how there are 6 N-states in a complete (*virtual* and *real* together) tholon.  If our tholonic quark model is in the ball park we would then expect to see 6 classes of quarks, and we do.  They are called “flavors”, and they are: *up, down, strange, charm, bottom*, and *top*.

Neutrons *do* exist, which seems to go against the tholonic idea that the virtual tholons don’t create anything, but remember, this thologram is a model of energy and relationships, not of form, so what we would expect to see is some *thing* that has zero energy&hellip; like a neutron. In fact, the neutron does have a charge even more powerful that the proton, but it is a charge made up of both positive and negative, thereby balancing it out to 0.  And what holds all these subatomic particles together? The *strong nuclear force* (mainly), which is the strongest force in the Universe (10<sup>39</sup> times more powerful than gravity) and the tholonic equivalent to, or represented by, the six integrated N-sources at the center of every hexagram.

In the thologram, all the NDC points are equidistantly separated from each other, meaning, they all repel each other equally, except for the blue dots/N-states, which form strongly bonded clusters when forced together.  We see this same quality in the *strong nuclear force* (SNF) which has a “weird” quality such that it only repels like-forces *after* they are separated.  When these forces are close to one another, the SNF pulls them together! Physicists call this weirdness *asymptotic freedom* (and humans call it “divorce”).  

This “weirdness” is similar to when a magnet breaks in two along the polar axis (see image below).  The two parts that were once one repel each other, that is, unless they reverse their orientation, or *attitude* (as in the nautical meaning of the word, although it sounds like is should apply to human relationships as well).  The specific mechanics of magnetism and the SNF may not be identical, but they seem to have a similar effect but in different scopes.

<center><img src='../Images/magnets.png' style='width:75%'/></center>

Most of what we have shown here involves how the movement of energy, in accordance to laws, brings form, and by extension, ideas, concepts and archetypes, into existence, yet almost nothing is said about the nature of the energy itself, other than that energy in its purest form is ultimately an expression of A&I.  Here we have 6 N-sources which hold the tholons together to form the center of creation.  In the quantum world, there is a similar concept of this energy that holds everything together, called *gluons*.  Gluons are mass-less and are absorbed and emitted by quarks and hold quarks together using the SNF.  There are 8 types of gluons that form the connections between quarks to create a proton, just as there are 8 types of trigrams that form a tholonic model of a proton (4 *real* and 4 *virtual*).   Tholonically speaking, it is the laws described as geometry in the thologram that hold everything together.  Is it reasonable to wonder if the other forces that holds things together, which are electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and gravity, are also represented geometrically somewhere in this infinite maze of tholonic patterns?

Understanding the tholonic nature of these forces may well give us an insight into understanding the nature of the source of the energy, which is to say, understanding the nature of the A&I that creates this reality.

But what about the electron? Where is that? tholonically speaking, the electron is a product of the imbalance of this hexagram which has a total charge of +1, and therefore it will automatically create an equal and opposite tholon (of an electron) with a charge of -1, which is also the total charge of the parent reflection tholon.  Where would this electron exist? At the opposite side of the N-sources across the scope of its children C and D, which is where N-sources manifest as stable expressions, i.e.  on the outer most edge of the hexagram (in a 2D tholon map).

<img src="../Images/SNF2.png" style='float:right;width:30%' />As these N-states are 0-dimensional concepts, i.e. nothing but A&Is, then we would expect the strong nuclear force, the most powerful force in existence, to have no effect on them, and indeed, electrons are unaffected by the SNF, just as the blue dots do not have any direct contact with the child N-state.  But this seems contradictory, as we now use this same model who show that it is electrons that will appear in-between the red and green balls, so does this mean that the SNF and electrons are similar in some way?  No, because describing how the electron fits into this model and how the SNF fits are two distinct concepts.  In the image on the right, you can see both the proton and the neutron as their component quarks (up, up down, and up down, down).  This is meant to show how at each level of instantiation, and for each concept, the same model applies but in a different context.  In the context of the SNF, we see that it instantiates only when *nucleons* (proton and neutrons) are connected.  In the case of the electron, the tholon’s concept and context is that of a neutron (as the blue dot), so we will see the same model in a different way.  For example, in the SNF context, where the proton and the neutron can never actually touch, those 6 N-state clusters in the center of the hexagons would look like 6 separate N-states <img src="../Images/6dots.png" style='vertical-align: middle;width:30px' />, rather then 6 joined N-states <img src="../Images/6dots_joined.png" style='vertical-align: middle;height:30px' />. When using this quantum metaphor, it also happens that *virtual* tholons turn out to instantiate as anti-matter.

This is what we would expect to see if we were looking at one perspective of a higher-dimensional model, and being multidimensional, it can be perceived many different ways, just as a 3D tetrahedron can be perceived as either of the shapes <img src="../Images/tricube2.png" style='height:15px' /> in 2D.  Compare the 2-dimensional map of (3 iterations of) overlapping tholons (below right) and a diagram of the current model of quarks as described using colors[^73].  There are a number of similarities.  This is not to say the thologram is a new model of quantum physics, simply that we can find similar patterns.  The tholonic argument is that the quantum model is an instance of the thologram in the context of the quantum world, and even the colors used to describe them are a tholonic model in the context of frequencies of energies, in this case, light, but the same applies to all frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum.

[^73]: Siegel, Ethan. “**Ask Ethan: Can Free Quarks Exist Outside Of A Bound-State Particle?**” Forbes. Forbes Magazine, August 3, 2019. <https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/08/03/ask-ethan-can-free-quarks-exist-outside-of-a-bound-state-particle>

Does this mean that everything that exists is somehow based on a self-similar trigram, conceptually at least?  This would suggest that is the case.  

The underlying point being made here is that the thologram, or any model of reality, is only one perspective of a much greater multidimensional model, and being multidimensional, it can be perceived many different ways.  The tholonic claim is that all models, including those of our ancestors that lived in the wild and in a world dominated by spirits, plants, insects and gods, are built on the same concepts.

As an aside, the proton has UP-UP-DOWN, and the neutron has DOWN-DOWN-UP. Because there is no significance to the order of quarks, DUU is the same as UDU and UUD,  and UDD is the same as DUD and DDU.  If we were to assign UP=1 and DOWN=0, we could arrange the quarks in the following order:  001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, which some readers might recognize as the binary values of the number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  With this in mind, we can identify the two quark arrangements of UUD and DDU as 011 and 001, or, 3 and 1, but when we consider all permutations of 3 places of either U or D, we see that the proton can have the values of 011, 010, or 110, or 3, 5, 6, and the neutron can have the values of 1, 2, 4, but as there is no order, we can say the neutron has a value of 7 (1+2+4), and the proton has a value of 14 (3+5+6).  However, as the order doesn’t matter, we can simple use the smallest number from each group, as energy always takes the path of least work.  This leaves us with just the values 1 and 3,  1 for any DDU group, and 3 for any UUD group.

However, if we have 3 positions and 2 values, we can create 8 numbers, not just 6. The values missing are, 0 and 7, or 000 and 111.  All together, we have the values of 0, 1, 3, 7, with 0/7 as the limits or duality, and 1, 3 as the instances within that duality, but instances that must combine to be balanced.  Combining 1 and 3 gives us 4, which suggests that 4 is the archetype of balance in the 3-dimensional context (making 2 the archetype of balance in the 2-dimensional world).  

**A point on stability and balance**

- It needs to be pointed out that *balanced* is not always the same as *stable*.  Stability depends on structure and balance, but depending on the structure of something, there is a certain limit of tolerance for imbalance.  For example, iron is imbalanced in that all the electrons spin in the same direction, which is what causes it to be magnetic, while in most other elements, half the electrons spin in clockwise, and half spin counterclockwise, balancing each other out.  However, iron is also quiet stable because the *body centered cubic* crystal it forms at the atomic level provides stability regardless of the imbalance of the electron spin. On a macro level, the more imbalance there is, the more structure is needed to compensate to remain sustainable.  This tells us that while both stability and balance determines the sustainability of something, stability appears to have a higher priority.  We saw confirmation of this as well when it came to photosynthesis in plants (in *Chapter 5: Reason*).

#### **Key 5:** Stability trumps balance.

While there is no such element made of UUU or DDD quarks (as far as I know, and if one did exist, it would be so imbalanced and unstable it would only exist for an instant), that does not mean they do not exist.  In the tholonic view, they do exist in the parent, the blue dot, the N-state, which, again, is a state that exists only as a concept, not in material reality.  The parent holds within it the limits of its context, which, in this case, are the values 0 and 7.  Alternatively, we can think of the parent as having 3 Us and 3 Ds, but in order to instantiate they need to find a stable pattern, which happens to be a pair of balanced (or as balanced as possible) sets of 3 quarks, or *baryons* (any 3 quarks is called a *baryon*) that balance out.  In the world of physics, a quark with a value 1 will pair with a quark with a value 3, but tholonically, a quark of value 3 must pair with a quark of value 4, as the total (3+4) must equal the limits (7).  It seems, so far, that as far as quarks are concerned, 3, 5, and 6 all act like 3, and 1, 4, and 2 all act like 1.  For this reason we can assign any U as 14 and any D as 7.  Now, a proton, being any combination of UUD, is therefore 14+14+7, or 7&times;5, or 35,  and a neutron is any combination of UDD, or 7+7+14, or 7&times;4, or 28.  The ratio of difference (28/35) between these two values happens to be 0.8, or 4/5, or 1/5 short of 1, which is not only the measured value of the first generation of a tholon (using the method described in the last chapter), but also explains why 5 is so critical in exposing the pattern of binary growth and decimation (as in ‘reduced by 10’, not ‘complete destruction’, as the word is commonly used to describe) of the &pi;-based pattern we see in the thologram.

How would that apply to the SNF?  I don’t know, but the obvious relationship is that the SNF is the “largest” of all the forces, in that it is the strongest force in existence, but only at the subatomic level.  Outside of that context it effectively doesn’t exist as it’s so weak, just as 7 is the largest value only with the context of values 0-7.   The other obvious relationship is that in this example the N-state must have the potential for 6 quarks (UUUDDD), and we see in the thologram that the SNF only comes into existence when there are 6 N-States <img src="../Images/6dots.png" style='vertical-align: middle;width:30px' />. For this reason, a single N-state is probably more like a *potential* SNF that probably needs other ingredients (hadrons?) necessary to instantiate.  

<center><img src='../Images/hadrons.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

This is a good place to remind the reader, again, that the tholonic model is not meant to be a model based on physics, or even mechanics.  It is a model that shows the patterns which physics, mechanics, and everything else, are based on. 

### Molecules

We mentioned above that the first instance of matter would be tetrahedral, at least conceptually, but we also stated that form, being an instantiation of the laws of form, would follow that model, meaning we should expect to see tetrahedral structures as one of the building blocks of reality.  We just saw how this might be the case in the quantum world, but what about the world of elements and molecules?

The actual first instance of matter in the Newtonian sense (vs. the quantum sense) are the elements, and while all elements have some type of trigram structure, no element has a tetrahedral structure when it is isolated. It is the bonds *between* the atomic elements that create the tetrahedral structure.  We can see how elements are acting like instances of a 2D trigram, even though they are expressions of a 3D tholon, which suggests that elements are the first material instances of a tholon, or are acting like a bridge between a tholon map (2D), and a tholon (3D).  In the tholon model, the individual elements exist at the 1<sup>st</sup> level of the thologram, which are the first tholons created by the folding of the 2D “map” and are shown as the numerous and small tetrahedrons upon which ever-larger tetrahedral structures emerge from.  That means we will not see actual tetrahedrons on this level, but we will see the same tholonic properties, such as form seeking the most stable state.  We don't see tetrahedral forms in 3D structures until the first iteration that emerges.  A single *H<sub>2</sub>O* molecule is not a tetrahedron in form because it only has 3 atoms, so it is a trigram.  Water, however, is tetrahedral.

<img src='../Images/haxagon.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>Water is a particularly good substance for exploring tholonic structures because it is one of the first, if not *the* first, tetrahedral structure that all life depends on.  Another early structure that is tetrahedral as a molecule alone is methane, one of the first organic molecules and not just a building block of life on Earth, but quite possibly the basis for an entirely different form of life, as pictured in the *Azotosome* above, and one we might discover on the Saturn moon of Titan.

It’s worth noting that the very first atom to come into existence was not hydrogen, but helium, with 2 protons, 2 neutrons and 2 electrons, as helium is the first *noble* gas, meaning it is perfectly balanced energetically, and therefore less vulnerable to the wild energies flying around after the Big Bang. Helium also forms a crystal, so the helium crystal is (probably) the first form to come into existence in the Universe.  That form can be either a cube or two hexagrams of 7 atoms each connected by a middle layer of 3 atoms.  Also of significance is that the first creation of matter, as atoms, started with 2 protons, not 1.  

Getting back to water; we saw that in the first generation of a tholon we have 4 trigrams, 3 of which are descending, or downward-pointing trigrams, and 1 is ascending, or upward-pointing trigram (“up” and “down” have only relative meaning here as it simply refers to the way the trigrams were drawn).  If we have two tholons then we have a total of 8 trigrams made up of 6 descending and 2 ascending trigrams.

<img src='../Images/085-h20.png' style='width:30px'/> H<sub>2</sub>O​ is composed of three atoms.  One atom is oxygen, which has an atomic number of 8 as it has 8 protons in its nucleus, which defines how much energy it holds as a “charge”. It also supports 8 electrons in its outermost shell, which represents its most balanced state.  The other two atoms are hydrogen, the archetype of all atoms.  Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 and has only 1 proton and 1 electron.  Although oxygen wants 8 electrons in its outer shell, it only has 6, so it naturally forms a bond with two hydrogen atoms by sharing the one electron each hydrogen has to offer.


From a tholonic perspective, oxygen follows the pattern of 2 3<sup>rd</sup> gen tholons from 1 face of a 2<sup>nd</sup> gen tholon, which has 6 *real* tholons and 2 *virtual* tholons (***Fig. v1*** below, showing two 3<sup>rd</sup> gen tholons).  Hydrogen follows the pattern of a complete 2<sup>nd</sup> gen tholon (***Fig. v2***, showing 2 complete 2<sup>nd</sup> gen tholons).  Combining these 3 tholons (***Fig. v3***) would represent 8 externally-facing points (from the *real* tholons) of interaction and two internally facing points (from the *virtual* tholons) of non-interaction.  When combined, the hydrogen tholons will attach to the empty or *virtual* tholons of oxygen.

We can see a few similarities between the tholonic model of *H<sub>2</sub>O* and its traditional chemical model.

<center><img src='../Images/tholon-atoms.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

<center><img src='../Images/086-h20-tholo.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This is just a hypothetical demonstration, as there may be a much better tholonic model for elements and compounds than this one, but this one is sufficient to show how we might be able to describe elements and compounds tholonically, which may give us new insights into their nature.

<center><img src='../Images/electron-shapes4.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Can we see this similar relationship with other compounds? Given that the basic archetypal shapes of molecules (shown above) can be represented within the thologram, perhaps this model can be applied to all compounds.  We claim this might be possible, as there is an almost infinite number of possible configurations in the thologram.  Instances of fundamental configurations, such as those that appear in the earlier stages of iterations and generations, like the Fibonacci sequence and the hexagram, would represent extremely stable patterns, and therefore we would expect to see them play a very fundamental part in our reality (like water and methane) and could be easily discovered.

The Fibonacci formula is especially tholonic.  For details, see “*Fibonacci Tholon*” in [Appendix C, “*Tholonic Math*”](#Appendix-C:-Tholonic-Math).

### Batteries

An example of how any system can be reduced to a tholon is presented in an insightful article on the effectiveness of batteries, titled “The Unfortunate Tetrahedron”[^74] .  This may seem fairly niche, but it turns out to be very relevant, which is not surprising considering that batteries are all about the movement and balancing of energy.  From this perspective, a simple battery is a microcosm of the Universe, from beginning to end.  In this article, the author shows how the systems of a simple battery can be modeled as a tetrahedron, and how these fundamental aspects of a system relate to one another.  The author looks at the four aspects of batteries; *energy density*, *power density*, *operating cost* and *capital cost*, where:

[^74]: Steingart, Dan. “**The Unfortunate Tetrahedron**.” Medium. the unfortunate tetrahedron, May 30, 2017. https://medium.com/the-unfortunate-tetrahedron/the-unfortunate-tetrahedron-ce1e44d0b961.

- **Energy density** (E) is how much energy a battery can store in its mass (like a dam).  This is the *N-source* as the energy density is the maximum potential of a battery’s usability, and energy is the whole point of a battery. This can also equate to *volts* given that volts, N-sources, and energy density all represent the *potential* of energy.

- **Capital cost** (C) is the cost of the battery.  This is a *defining* point because it is a point of *resistance*.  The cost will define if it gets bought.

- **Operating cost** (O) is the cost to recharge the battery, and costs associated with keeping it safe and proper disposal. This is the *Contributing* point, because this defines how the battery will integrate into the environment (of its use).  This can also equate to *current* and *acceleration* as operating costs represent a constant application of effort.

- **Power density** (P) is how much energy it can deliver relative to its mass (like the turbines in a dam).  This is the *white dot*, *power*, or the amount of energy the battery can deliver over how much time.

With this ordering, we can build a tholon for “batteries”.

<center><img src='../Images/battery-tetrahedron.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The article describes  the relationship between **E** (energy density) and **P** (power density), which is equivalent to an *N-source* and a *defining* point, can be described in a *Ragone Space*.  The Ragone plot (right) measures the performance comparison of various energy-storing devices.  This chart is a perfect example of the axis of “laws, rules and limits” that connects an *N-space* with a *defining* point in the model of the tholon.

On the opposite side, between **C** (capital cost) and **E** (energy density), which is equivalent to a *contributing* point and an *N-source*, we have the tholonic axis of “service”, which is pretty clear; does the battery provide a service?  Remember that the descriptions of “laws” and “service” were specifically meant to apply to concepts of *Definition* and *Contribution* the context of our daily lives.  

According to the tholonic model, the only place where stable patterns capable of replication can occur is between the limitations of *Definition* and the integration of an instance (form) as *Contribution*, which here is **D** (capital costs) and **C** (operating cost).  Across this spectrum of “cooperation or conflict” is where price and value come to terms with each other, as in “getting the most for your money”.  In the battery world (and many other worlds as well), this is the juggling act between good, cheap, and fast, and the arena which produces all the various instances of batteries that can deliver power at a cost, most of the instances landing in the “middle”, representing the best product for the best price for a specific market.  Here would appear instances like alkaline cell batteries (Duracell), lead-acid batteries (car batteries), nickel-cadmium batteries (rechargeable batteries), etc.  Each of these new instances (stable patterns), can then go on to create their own tholonic archetype.

### Consciousness

The highly respected and published team of Donald David Hoffman (cognitive psychologist, author, and Professor in the Department of Cognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine) and Chetan Prakash (PhD Mathematical Physics, Cornell University) developed the idea of a *conscious agent*, which is a dynamic process of consciousness and argue that it is the interaction between various agents that produce measurable phenomena such as the position, momentum, and energy of objects.  They further argue that these objects have no objective, absolute, or even preexisting properties and only exist in relation to consciousness via these *conscious agents.* This is a radical claim, but their arguments and evidence as laid out in their paper “*Objects of consciousness*” [^77] can’t be ignored.  What also can’t be ignored is the striking similarity between their model and the tholonic model, as shown below.  (This was also especially striking for me as I learned of this long after the first draft of this book.  Of course, they do a far better job of explaining their idea technically, mathematically, and psychologically.)

### Circuits and the “God Formula”

There are many examples of how concepts and processes follow the tholonic model:

- **Complexity economics**, which asks "how individual behaviors in a situation might react to the pattern they together create, and how that pattern would alter itself as a result, causing the agents to react anew."[^76]
- **Calculus**, with its concepts of *differentiation* and *integration* that join to create a new value.
- **The stock exchange**, with is opposing forces that negotiate to arrive at a price.
- **Faith and belief** in how it integrates the existential trinity of *all*, *all that is possible*, and *all that is*, or trinity of knowledge; the *known known*, *known unknown* and the *unknown unknown*.

Really,  just about any ordered system can be seen in a tholonic perspective.  We won’t go through them all, obviously, but the following example is especially interesting and informative.

Electronic circuits are especially interesting and relevant to the tholonic model.  One of the most common and important circuits in electrical systems is the very simple *resistor-capacitor circuit*, or *RC circuit*.  It is used to filter and control signals not only in man-made electrical circuits, but in natural electrical circuits such as neuro-transmission in the brain and throughout the entire nervous system of any living organism.  No doubt the reader has seen such circuits as they exist in every computer system, alarm clock, microwave, and virtually all electronic devices.

Briefly, an electrical **resistor** is a component that can reduce the flow of current, adjust signal levels, divide voltages, and limit or control the current of a circuit in some way.  A **capacitor** is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field.  In one way, a capacitor is like a battery in that it can store energy, but unlike a battery, it has no charge of its own but can store a charge from an external source.  Air alone acts like a capacitor and is often used in radio circuits.

Let’s  look at a simple RC circuit.

<center><img src='../Images/rccircuit.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We have 2 basic elements in this circuit; an element that that limits and divides, and an elements that collects and stores.  These concepts are perfectly in line with the basic concepts of *Definition/limitation* and *Contribution/integration* as shown in the *Alternate View* above.

How can we validate this similarity? Let’s  look at the following:

- The N-state acts as both the source and the destination of the energy.  This would represent both ends of a battery, or a charge and a ground.

- The capacitor is returning the energy to the destination, and the resistor imposes restrictions on the source.

- Voltage originates in the N-state in this example, which is also the case when we assign electrical properties to the tholon, as we did in the section on Ohm’s law, so there is consistency.

- The output of a RC circuit is a wave which has a unique form showing an exponential growth followed by an exponential drop, <img src='../Images/rcwave.png' style='height:15px'/>. While the details of the form can change depending on the components, it always has the same characteristics of a sharp ascending and descending.  The interesting thing about this waveform is that it can be perfectly recreated by quadrants of a circle.  Of course, just because two things have the same shape doesn’t mean they share anything else than the shape, but in this case it appears they share more. At the least, if the RC circuit *is* an instance of a tholonic trigram, then we would expect to see its output have some relationship to the thologram… and we do.

  *Note: The lower case “n” represents a new child N-state that results from the children of the parent N-source.*

  *<img src='../Images/tri-cir.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>*In the image to the right, we have divided this hypothetical circle into 4 quadrants and numbered them tholonically, which means we use the *spatially* sequential values 0,1,3,2 (the *temporal* sequence is 0,1,2,3 because 3 can only come into existence *after* 1 and 2,  but once 3 exists, it does so in-between 1 and 2)  of the 4 points of a tholon.  If we assign these colors to those quadrants where 0=blue (parent N-state), 1=green (Limitation), 2=red (Contribution) and 3=yellow (child *n*-state), we find the same characteristics and patterns we see in the thologram, specifically, the 2D tholon map. For example, the image below shows the output of an RC circuit as the result the of overlapping of the circles we just described.
  
  -  We see only the N-States (yellow and blue) overlap on their own color and alternate between parent&rarr;child&rarr;parent&rarr;child, etc., as we would expect.
  -  The D (green) and C (red) alternate in direction and pair up, and in doing so create a new child *n*-state (yellow).
  -  There is no square that has a piece of N (blue). It is either all N (blue), all *n* (yellow), or DC*n* (red-green-yellow).
  -  Every quadrant that is not exclusively an N-state contains all the the other attributes (red, green, yellow) which alternate only along the path of the *lineage* (parent&rarr;child).
  -  Each circle in the row is alternately flipped on both the N*n* (blue-yellow) axis of parent-child N-states and the across DC (red-green) axis.
  -  The direction of the overlaps are the same as the path of the lineage in the tholon.
  -  The overlapping values are a product of 3 &times; 0, 1, 2, and in an order that creates a continuous oscillation <img src='../Images/036.png' style='height:25px'/>. 

<center><img src='../Images/rcgrid.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

- In the tholon, the field in which the *n*-state can be created exists between D and C.  Here, that field is defined by *R* and *C*, which creates a field of *time*.  In electronics it is called the *time constant​* and is written as ***τ = RC*** (where ***τ*** is the Greek *tau* representing the *time constant​*)  and proves that the voltage (*V*) and the current (*I*) are always inverse to one another at any moment in time and increase/decrease as a function of time.

This *time constant* is then used to calculate *V* and *I* using the formulas *V(τ)=V<sub>B</sub>(I-e<sup>-τ/RC</sup>)* and *I(τ)=I<sub>0</sub>(e<sup>-τ/RC</sup>)*.  The point here is not to get into the math, but to show not only that *V* and *I* relate to each other via *R* and *C*, and by extension, *D* and *C*, but that they do so across a field that in the world of electronics is defined by ***e***, or 2.7182, the number of the *natural log*.  This is especially interesting when applying the properties of this RC field to that of the DC field of the tholon, because ***e*** is one of the most profound and fascinating numbers in nature!

*Historical note: Although the value of **e** was discovered by Bernoulli in 1618, The first appearance of **e** as the symbol for this value was in an unpublished paper by Euler in 1728 on the explosive forces in cannons.*

It is similar to *pi* in its significance, but where *pi* is the ratio between circumference and diameter shared by all circles, ***e*** is the base **rate of growth shared by all continually growing processes**.  It has also been called the **epitome of universal growth**.  This growth can be anything; population, radioactive decay, interest calculations, even jagged or unpredictable systems that don’t grow smoothly.  Anything that has a continuous growth can be modeled with ***e***.  ***e*** is to growth what the radius is to the circle.

***e*** and the *Natural Log*, or *ln()*, are two sides of the same concept as ***e*** and the Natural Log are inverse, or opposite one another, so *ln(e)=1*.  ***e*** describes **growth**, and Natural Log describes **time**.  For example:

- ***e<sup>x​</sup>*** is the amount we have after starting at 1.0 and growing continuously for ***x*** units of time, so ***e<sup>x</sup>*** lets us **plug in time and get growth**.
- ***ln(x)*** (Natural Logarithm) is the time it will take to reach amount ***x***, so ***ln(x)*** lets us **plug in growth and get the time** it would take.

If you remember back in chapter 3, it was shown how logarithms were the natural way nature understands scale, or scope, and while *common logs* are based on 10, the *natural log*, ***e***, is so named because it is the only value where the inverse of *time* equals *growth*.

Considering that the tholon is a model of growth, it seems particularly applicable that ***e*** would define the field from which new N-states spawn new tholons.  

<img src='../Images/ipe2.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>There is one more significance to ***e*** that is purely tholonic and will no doubt annoy math purists, but is added here not only because of its symmetry, but because the concepts that these values described *do* exist in the tholonic model, even if this particular form may not be the *exact* way they are best represented.  As was just shown, the spectrum between *Definition* and *Contribution* is, in this context, defined by the value of ***e***. Referring back to how it was described that 1 point creates 2 points and 2 points create 3 points, when we created the 2<sup>nd</sup> point we had a 1D line from *Negotiation* to *Definition*.  However, we also had a center and a radius, thereby defining a circle.  In this way, the first 2 points implies the relationship between a radius and a circle, which is *pi*,  so were we to assign a value to that 1D line, *pi* would be the best candidate.  It was also explained how the  3<sup>rd</sup> point represented complex numbers.  If N=-1, then the CN line could reasonably be seen as ***i***, the imaginary value for the square-root of -1.

If this tholonic trigram represents the three values of ***e***, *&pi;*, and ***i***, we can construct Euler’s Formula, or what has been called the most elegant formula in math,  *<IMG src="../Images/math/345.svg" style="vertical-align:middle;height:12pt"/>+1=0*.  This formula integrates all the dynamic connections between the points and the originating point into a beautiful concept.  In addition, as ***e*** represents time and *pi* represents space, we have the two dimensions of time and space, plus the concept that describes the reality of cycles, that being complex numbers (which are necessary to add cycles that are different, for example).

What then would be the value of the 4<sup>th</sup> point of the *white dot*?  It’s probably *time*, as none of these values have any significance without time, so perhaps the time constant can be applied to the 4<sup>th</sup> point, but this is just a guess.  

This beautiful formula is fundamental to the continuous exchange of energy that we perceive as time (where 0 equals the present moment), and a whole bunch of other basic ideas of reality.  This formula is so fundamental, in fact, that not only is it called the **God Formula**, it has been presented as empirical proof of the existence of god.  We are not that ambitious, pious, or learned, and simply call it fundamental archetypal instance of a tholon.

If $e{^i}{^\pi}$=-1 then *ln(-1)=$\pi i$* and we apply the concepts of of ***e*** and ***ln( )***, as described above, then $\pi i$ equates to time, and the spectrum of ***e*** represents the growth.  Does this also suggest that the originating energy of everything, including the Universe, started with a negative movement? There is more evidence to suggest that is the case, and later it is shown why and what that really means.

<img src='../Images/1tt.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>There is yet another supporting argument for ***e*** which we can see when we map the original formula for ***e*** that was discovered by Bernoulli in the 17<sup>th</sup> century (right) to the tholonic trigram, which shows a remarkably compatible pattern.  

If we go in the forward direction using the three values of 1, $\frac{1}{x}$ and *x*, we arrive at ***e***, the value of *growth*.  If we go in the reverse direction, we arrive at 1, the value of unity (and no growth).  What is so interesting about this is that the N-state is 1, as in not 0, not *nothing*, , representative of *something*.  The *Definition* point, the point of resistance and limitation, or low entropy chaos, is $\frac{1}{x}$, or *something that is limited*. The final *Contribution* point, the point of the *integration*, the final state of balance, high entropy chaos, is ***x***.   We could easily translate the math to say:

> Unity plus the chaos of its infinite divisions creates new systems on its way to its final state of total balance.  



## The Bigger Picture

<img src='../Images/math-tetrahedron.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>It may look like our math has taken some “liberties” using more exotic values to support the argument that there is a natural and fundamental pattern of order that can be seen in the tetrahedron, and there is probably a lot of patterns that can be applied with various numbers that make the same “sense”.   That would be partly true, as the tetrahedron contains all kinds of patterns that can be seen in nature an math, but some or more “in your face” that others.  For example, when we used the numbers 6, 2, and 3 for our trigram corner points we can see a pattern of division (***Fig. g1***), and a pattern of multiplication (***Fig. g2***).  These are the same pattern  for **+** and **-** as well.  When we use ***e***, ***i*** and ***&pi;*** , we can see a pattern of multiplication and exponents (***Fig. g3***).  

Each of these patterns represent different ways energy moves in a tholon and requires different types of values to function properly.  The values of 6, 2, and 3 work with patterns **g1** and **g2**, but not in the same manner with pattern **g3**, which works with values ***e***, ***i*** and ***&pi;***, but they support each other.  For example, if we only use values of ***i*** for pattern **g1**, using the values of ***i<sup>1</sup>***, ***i<sup>2</sup>***, ***i<sup>3</sup>***,  we get values of *i, -1, -i*, which perfectly comply with pattern **g1** as *$\frac{i}{-1}$=-i, $\frac{i}{-i}$=1,* and *i&times;-1=-1*. But this is a tetrahedron, so we need that 4<sup>th</sup> *white dot* point that needs to be a value that is fundamental to, and compatible with, all the other values.  That would be *i<sup>0</sup>*, which is 1 and the value that all these values are derived from.  And with that, all the formulas work.  If we continued with *i<sup>5</sup>, i<sup>6</sup>*, and so on, we would get the same values because no matter how many multiples of i are used, it can only result in *1, i, -1, or -i*, which is yet more validation of the tetrahedron model.  This pattern also tells us that the cardinal values of the points on a trigram are the exponential values of 1 (at the top), then 2 and 3, with the 4<sup>th</sup> point as 0 *after* the tholonic trigram has created its 3 children and folded into a tetrahedron.  So, while the instances of the pattern are different, the pattern where the types of functions are grouped by the base and side trigrams.

## Back to Basics

Let’s now map Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> law (in the form of Ohm’s Law) to the tholon, which fits nicely.

To apply Ohm’s Law we have to correlate the N, D and C values to V, I and R, like so:

-   **N** (negotiation) as V (voltage,  potential and field of potential)
-   **D** (definition) with R (resistance,  opposition to free flow)
-   **C** (contribution) with I (current,  force of flow)

This allows us to state the following:

<center><img src='../Images/088-tholo-trimath-3.png' style='width:90%'/></center>

We've taken a big leap here by applying math to such abstract concepts and expecting so see something meaningful, but if we look as these definitions as abstractions they seem quite reasonable, just as they did to the founders of mathematics. 

## The (lost) Meaning of Math

To look closer we need to make sure we’re all on the same page regarding how the trigram can describe the math functions of Ohm’s law, and to do that we need to clarify some really simple concepts, such as what do the math symbols mean in this context.

Addition and subtraction are easy concepts to grasp.  We take some number of things and add or remove some number of things.  But depending on the context even simple addition and subtraction requires some extra thought. A good example of this is how addition and subtraction affect colors. It is not intuitive to most people that *violet - cyan = blue*, for example, but once shown it makes sense.

<center><img src='../Images/090-addition.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

What about multiplication and division then? In this context we will describe division as *the definition of one value by the units of another value*.  For example, in division, such as 3=$\frac{12}{4}$ we are stating that 3 is what we get when we measure an existing value of 12 by a unit of 4.  In multiplication, such as *12=3&times;4,* we are determining a new value of 12 by combining 3 of these units-of-4.  The 4, as the divisor or multiplier, is the *unit of measurement* and the 3 is the *number of units*.  Every kid knows what was just stated, but when we apply those same simple rules and concept to a non-math context, they become very significant.  (For highly speculative thoughts on the meaning of squares and square roots see *Meaning of Squares and Square Roots* in [Appendix C, “Tholonic Math”](#Appendic-C:-Tholonic-Math))

As mentioned above, we would expect to see the same laws expressed in different ways across all the scopes that the laws apply to, so we would expect to see an example of Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law in the tholonic realms of society, or planets, or organisms, and we do.  For comparison, we also show how the attributes of the tholon would appear using the same laws.

<center><img src='../Images/hor-laws.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

For example, if we claim that a **society** is based on its **ethics** and we also posit that **ethics** are to be measured by **laws**, we can say ***society=ethics&div;laws***, and likewise, ***ethics=laws &times; society***.  If we measure the **power** of a **society** by its ability to function or “**work**”, and the measure of a **society** by its **sustainability**, then, according to these formulas, a **society** with a lot of **laws** and very little **ethics** will **work** less and be less **sustainable**.  On the other hand, a **society** that has a lot of **ethics** and very few **laws** will be far more **sustainable** and produce even more **work**.

Here, we interpret “laws” as *limiting factors* with regard to its members.  Those limits could even be limits on limits, e.g., The 1<sup>st</sup> amendment of the U.S. Constitution guaranteeing the right to free speech is a law, but it is a limitation on a limitation, in that it limits the State from limiting an individual's right.  For context, an example of a society with a lot of limiting laws and very little ethics would be North Korea or Syria.  An example of a society with fewer limiting laws and higher ethics would be Norway or Sweden.  *Note: These rankings are according to institutions that rank countries [^309]and not necessarily the examples I would personally choose*.

[^309]: “**Freedom in the World**” (2018), published by Freedom House, **Democracy Index** (2017), published by The Economist Intelligence Unit, **V-Dem Annual Democracy Report** (2018), published by the V-Dem Institute

If we claim that individuals interacting with each other (commerce, culture, aid, community) represents the strength of a society, then we might say this interaction correlates with *current*.  If *ethics* represents the arena in which individuals operate, then we could correlate *ethics* with *voltage*.  *Laws*, which define limits, would then reasonably be correlated to *resistance*.  All together, individuals, ethics, and laws form a *society*.

We are effectively assigning the values of:

- 3 = ***interaction*** and equates to **current** (I) or  **acceleration** (a)
- 6 = ***ethics*** and equates to **voltage** (V) or **force** (F)
- 2 = ***laws*** and equates to **resistance** (R) of **mass** (m)
- 18 = ***work*** and equates to **power** (P)

These are numbers that work with Newton’s and Ohm’s Law, but in this context, the quantitative value of these numbers are not important. We are using the numbers just to show the relationships. The number itself is merely a concept of measure.  Power, which is the transference of energy over time, would then correlate to how much “work” this society could generate.  Perhaps this would be seen in their social achievement, or productivity, or levels of cooperation, but could also represent a “work product” of oppression, taxation, or enslavement, if that is the goal of the society.

How these assignments were arrived at is not critical because they may differ depending on how one chooses to correlate, so this detail does not matter for the point being made.  

With these assignments, *society*=$\frac{ethics}{laws}$ follows the same reasoning as the formula as 3=$\frac{6}{2}$ , so we can imagine different scenarios, for example:

- Case 1) *interaction* = $\frac{ethics}{laws}$ = $\frac{6}{2}$ = 3 ∴ work = 18

- Case 2) *interaction* = $\frac{ethics}{laws}$ = $\frac{12}{2}$ = 6 ∴ work = 72

- Case 3) *interaction* = $\frac{ethics}{laws}$ = $\frac{6}{4}$  = 1.5 ∴ work = 9

If this premise has any validity, this would suggest that a lot of laws and little ethics, or perhaps where the ethics are enforced by law rather than conscience, leads to an inefficient society, while a society with few laws and lots of ethics leads to a productive society.

How would we calculate *sustainability* then? Here is one way, perhaps, but this is totally outside the context of the law as we currently use it, so it will probably make no sense from an engineering perspective.  In short, we simply take the product of all the unit-counts of *society* and measure it by the product of the unit-measures of *society*:

$society = I = \frac{V}{R}\ or\ \frac{P}{V}\ or\ \sqrt{\frac{P}{R}}\therefore\frac{unit\ count}{unit\ measure}\therefore \frac{V\times P\times \sqrt{P}}{R\times V\times \sqrt{R}}$

Applied to these 3 cases, we get the following:

- Case 1) $\frac{6}{2}\ or\ \frac{18}{6}\ or\ \sqrt{\frac{18}{2}}\ \therefore \frac{6\times 18\times \sqrt{18}}{2\times 6\times \sqrt{2}}\ \therefore \frac{458.2}{16.9}=27.1$
- Case 1) $\frac{12}{2}\ or\ \frac{72}{12}\ or\ \sqrt{\frac{72}{2}}\ \therefore \frac{12\times 72\times \sqrt{72}}{2\times 12\times \sqrt{2}}\ \therefore \frac{7331.3}{33.9}=216.3$
- Case 1) $\frac{6}{2}\ or\ \frac{9}{6}\ or\ \sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\ \therefore \frac{6\times 9\times \sqrt{9}}{2\times 6\times \sqrt{2}}\ \therefore \frac{162}{16.9}=9.5$

How these translate to the real world is only speculative, as it is up to the reader to decide if *laws*, *society*, *ethics*, and *work* are the best concepts to use here, and if so, how are the social equivalents of *power*, *ethics*, *laws*, *work*, and *sustainability* actually measured, as well as the significance of squares and square-roots.

How would this look if we used concepts such as *natural rights*, *privileges* and *responsibilities*?

This can apply to any properly defined trigram.  For example, if we applied this same exercise to the cognitive behavioral trigram we mentioned previously we might claim that *behavior* is a product of *thoughts* (one’s own or those one is exposed to?) and that *thoughts* are to be measured by *feelings*, thus, *behavior = thoughts &div; feelings* and *thoughts = behavior &times; feelings*.  This would suggest that high *thought* with low *feeling* results in higher *behavior* and higher *power* (whatever that means in this context..  intention? beliefs? desires? will?), while low *thought* and high *feelings* results in much lower *power* and even lower *behavior*.  

I suspect it would take quite a bit of discussion and research to find the best values.  The point of this is to suggest that with the correct values, these equations would produce meaningful results. Still, someone who acts out of emotions with very little thought is bound to have a less sustainable lifestyle that one who tempers their emotions with thought, so these may not be too far off.

In any case, the twelve formulas of Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> law shows some potential when applied to other contexts and may offer a new perspective on the dynamics of culture and society that, if nothing else, raises some worthwhile questions.  As it applies here, it shows how the tholon can describe everything from atoms to culture, as long as we know what data to apply.  Because the math involved in a tholon can be more than the reader might be interested in, more of this subject is covered in *Appendix C, “Tholonic Math”.*

Because our 4D (3D+time) reality maps neatly into the 4D tetrahedron, especially when using the synergetic 4D quadray coordinate system based on the tetrahedron, we may be able to correlate radically different contexts, such as space-time,  psychology, and electricity, to name a few.

With this in mind, let’s reexamine the previous claims that began this thread:

**Definition = Negotiation &div; Contribution**

The definition of something is its boundaries, limits, abilities, attributes, properties, and resources.  All of these details are the results of the scope and context of that thing’s instance.  It could be environmental factors, genetic attributes, physical limitations, such as size and weight of a thing, energy levels, etc.  It is the nature of energy to expand (i.e. disperse due to entropy) in every way possible.  That expansion is the contribution, but it is the resistance from these factors that determines what expansions get the opportunity to be expressed and what expansions are thwarted.  That battle between the force of expansion and the force of resistance is the negotiation (*see Negotiation=Contribution &times; Definition*).  As *Definition* is *Negotiation* &div; *Contribution*, we can say that *Definition* is measured by that which is *Contributed*, or, the *Definition* of something is determined by what it can (sustainably) *Contribute*.

**Contribution = Negotiation &div; Definition**

What a thing can *Contribute* is measured by its *Definition*, but the degree to which it can contribute is determined by its environment and how it interacts with that environment.  That interaction is a result of *Negotiation*.  A thing must provide something that something in its environment needs, otherwise what it has to contribute is useless and unintegratable.

**Negotiation = Contribution &times; Definition**

A thing’s ability to find a stable and sustainable position within its environment and scope is determined by the degree to which it can contribute with its current resources.  A thing may have a *Definition* that gives it a lot of A and a little of B, but if its environment needs a lot of B and very little A, then it is B that the thing must *Contribute* to ensure its existence in that environment, or it needs to find another environment, or change its environment so that A is in more demand.

Applying different values and concepts can result in new data.  We experiment with this a little, but given it is outside the main theme of this book, we have put that section under “New data?” in *Appendix C, “Tholonic Math”*

## The shape of knowledge

The point of all this is to show one way that the tholon can be used and viewed.  There are many new ways of looking at energy in all its forms when viewed tholonically.

<center><img src='../Images/093-DNA.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

We showed examples of quarks and molecules, but in higher orders, such as DNA, we also see some striking similarities as well, and with a bit of investigation, we can probably find some stunning relationships.  

DNA and how it is both tholonic and binary in nature is examined in the companion book “*The Tholonic I-Ching*”.

DNA’s relationship with tetrahedrons is particularly unique given the creation of tetrahedrally structured DNA, or TDN as it is referred to.  TDN is the cutting edge of DNA nanotechnology and has various applications such as drug delivery, inhibiting certain gene expressions, and of course, interfacing with bio-sensors.  These TDNs assemble themselves from scratch and offer greater strength and stability than the ol’ fashioned dual-strand DNA.  Given that there is little accessible information on TDNs for the layperson there is not much more that can be said here, other then they look pretty awesome and will most likely be the origin of a new form of life powered by TDN-interfacing A.I. DNA-integrated quantum computers.

<center><img src='../Images/tdn.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Our simple trigrams of relationships, such as Newton’s  2<sup>nd</sup> Law, becomes a *tetrahedron* or *tholon* of relationships.  Whereas before it was stated that every piece of knowledge can be deconstructed into a trigram, by the same token, every piece of knowledge forms a tetrahedron. With this more expanded tetrahedral model in mind, let’s briefly jump back to the examples of deconstruction mentioned earlier.
