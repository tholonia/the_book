# Appendix L: The Thologram and Religion

###### Awareness and Intention, or God

## Tholonic Divinity

The tholonic claim is that our understanding of reality is determined by the context of our understanding the universally consistent laws, and because of this, we will see the same patterns through these different cultural lenses.  

Prior to modern science, it was religion that provided that lens, and over thousands of years inspired and brilliant minds studied and philosophized on the nature of these god-given tenants in an attempt to unveil the mysteries of the God, the Universe, and Life.  

Not surprisingly then, we can see a number of parallels between the ancient understanding of God, the creations of God, and the thologram.

In the traditional and current Christian view of the Judaeo-Christian model (The Jewish model is similar, but not exactly the same) there exists 9 angelic choirs made up of 3 spheres of responsibility with each sphere having 3 classes of angels.

This is remarkably similar to the tholonic model, but limited to a single tholon.

We can even see how the class of angles fits neatly into the tholonic trinity of *Negotiation/Definition/Contribution* (or *Balance/Limitation/Form*):

- *Negotiation/balance* angels are tasked with care-taking, delivering, and manifesting the will of God.
- *Defining/limiting* angels are tasked with guarding, operating, and watching God’s creations.
- *Contributing/form* angels are the wheels, the warriors, and man’s personal guiding angels.

Even more astonishing is that some of the greatest religious philosophers have described this angelic hierarchy in ways that sound perfectly tholonic.  For example, the most respected and influential philosopher and Torah scholar of the Middle Ages, Maimonides (Moses ben Maimon, 1138–1204 CE. Spain), in his book “Guide of the Perplexed”, explains at length how angels are forms of intelligence, and what is referred to an “angels” are not only the forces and laws of nature, but the forces of imagination, ideas, and even the mind of man.  Furthermore, reality as we know it is formed by these invisible intelligences as well as the intelligence of Man.  He supports his arguments with the ideas of Aristotle, Plato, and even the angles themselves as they are portrayed to conclude that:

> Thus the Sages reveal to the aware, that *the imaginative faculty is also called an angel; and the mind is called a cherub*. How beautiful this will appear to the sophisticated mind – and how disturbing to the primitive.”

He doubles-down on his heretical claims by stating t￼hat reality is controlled by the laws of physics, not by God’s will, most miracles never happened, and perhaps his most egregious claim, that divine providence is non-supernatural, is not given by the grace of God, but is achieved by perfection of the intellect&hellip; and this was 800 years ago!

Of course, telling people that angels are anthropomorphized constructs of forms of intelligence and that they were responsible for their own divine providence not go over so well, and his book was quickly condemned and burned by both Jews and Christians.

This was 800 years ago, but going back as far 2000 years we can see the same sentiment  in the Christian Bible:

> Bible: “For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible, and invisible… all things have been created through him and for him”. Colossians 1:16-17 

The tholonic view is identical, only related in terms of tholons and energy:

> Tholonic: “All things exist within the thologram, from concepts to forms.  All things come in to existence through the movement of energy for the sole purpose attaining balance.”

I want to make it very clear that this in no way is meant disparage, disrespect, or even criticize religious beliefs.  The tholonic position is all views, beliefs, perspectives are equally valid, and with each perspective comes certain understandings and limitations. The major difference between the tholonic model and the religious model is a duality between nothing and something vs. the duality between good and evil and that there is no “will of God”, there is only Awareness and Intention.  The tholonic view even recognizes an ultimate creator, that being the Awareness and Intention that all energy comes from.  in fact, if you replace the concept of “God” with “energy”, the “will of God” with “tholons intelligence and “divine beings” with “tholons”, there are remarkable similar.

All tholons are expressions of energy and are created by energy.  Tholons are regulated by tholonic intelligence, and all tholons have the ability to creating more tholons. 

The first tholon within which all other are created could be considered as the God Tholon, but that tholon itself was created by Awareness and Intention which has no traits or characteristics other than A&I. Any concept of a god or divine being that has any traits whatsoever, other than A&I, would by definition be a child tholon that has its own tholonic intelligence and therefore has an agenda of some sort as it requires its own child tholons to exist as well as having to co-exist with its peers and in accordance to its parent.
