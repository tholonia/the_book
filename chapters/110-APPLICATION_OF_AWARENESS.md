It may seem odd that *mythology* would be placed in the chapter of how awareness is/can be applied in the real world, but beliefs of any sort are excellent examples of the application of awareness.  Beliefs are perhaps the most common way to channel awareness as they can cohere the otherwise undirected and unrestrained awareness.  In this way, beliefs act like the point of *Definition* in the tholonic trinity, putting restrictions on how that awareness is expressed.  Considering this, it is no wonder that mythologies so closely reflected the archetypes of creation.  From the tholonic view, it was/is the intelligence of these archetypes that vie for that awareness within the arena of human consciousness. Mythologies and beliefs are the earliest form of Man's *conscious will* to have a hand in the creation of his reality.

It may sound childish or even superstitious to suggest that archetypes can have intentions that can result in conflicting and/or cooperative relationships, which implies allies and enemies, and therefore some sort of diplomacy and politics.  In one sense it is childish, in that it leaves so much open to the imagination. In another sense it is childish because beliefs in general are an early form of learning how to use the power of awareness.  Beliefs are the Legos of awareness.  Beliefs are also placeholders that fill in the blanks of our limited understanding of the mechanics of awareness, intention, and intelligence, which is also why they have such a significant effect on our understanding of reality.  

The ancient myths provided a pretty effective way to understand the workings of reality, given the context and scope of our abilities when they were created.  We see these gods and their unending dramas as anthropomorphized concepts of tholonic intelligences and their interactions. As previously stated, tholonic archetypes, like the gods themselves, are autonomous agents in a self-reproducing system.  To get a general idea of the Mexican-soap-opera-of-psychopaths-on-steroids that was the life of the Gods, see *Appendix D*, “*Greek Gods*”  It is short, and quite entertaining.

These two charts compare the hierarchy of the Greek Gods (according to Gaius Julius Hyginus, a scholar born in 64 B.C.) and the same hierarchy composed of one (of many) archetypes represented by that deity.

Its insightful to see how everything starts out in the nothingness of the void, descends through the noble qualities of intellect, skill, healing, imagination, and ultimately settles down to youth, sex, booze, food, and war.  Clearly, the Ancient Greeks were on to something.

## Sensing Intention

The idea that plants, and presumably other life forms, are sensitive to the feelings and intentions of others within their sphere of influence is not a new idea.  One of the early (1960s) instances of this idea is called the *Backster Effect*[^300]named after Grover Cleveland Backster Jr. who was not only an interrogation specialist for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) but went on to become Chairman of the *Research and Instrument Committee of the Academy for Scientific Interrogation*.  From his “interrogations” of plants, he concluded that plants not only feel pain, but emotions, and even have ESP abilities.

There still exists debate as to the validity of his claims, as well as the claims made in the popular 1973 book “*The Secret Life of Plants*”, but at the very least, there is sufficient evidence to justify more investigation.  The tholonic view is that everything that exists is part of a *Vast Active Living Intelligence System* (to borrow the title of a book by author Phillip K. Dick) that we are calling the Thologram, and consequently, everything *must* be connected to everything else in some way and form.  As our knowledge and our ability to share that knowledge expands, our understanding of reality so too will expand, and in many different directions.  Multiple theories, philosophies, practices, will not only emerge, but each will have their own body of evidence supporting that model. Some will flourish and others will wither away. This is the evolution of perspective.  

[^300]: Backster, Cleve & Karron, Db. (1968). **Evidence of a Primary Perception In Plant Life**. 10. 

Similar to the "Can you prove Australia exists?" problem, at some point we need to choose what or who to *believe* as true or not. While the Backster Effect is soundly grounded in tholonic principles, that alone is not enough to accept it as real.  Perhaps the most convincing support comes from one of the more ingenious scientists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Marcel Vogel.    

Marcel Vogel  (1917 - 1991) was a research scientist for IBM’s San Jose facility for 27 years and was granted a number of patents, from hard-disk magnetic coatings to egg testing.  At age six he was pronounced dead from double lobar pneumonia. He claimed that while he was “dead” he experienced a light and a sense of love and well being that was overwhelming, and this formed the underlying fabric of his life and beliefs. 

With the aid of IBM's state-of-the-art equipment, he replicated the Backster Effect.  Below is the polygraph results that he said made him a “believer”.

<img src='../Images/Cleve_Backster_2.png' style='width:100%'/>

Vogel even lectured at IBM on the subject of "Do Plant Have Emotions?", which, in 1969, was a radical concept.  He experimented with plants for some time and discovered a number of very odd and “unscientific” facts.  For example; 

- It was observed that when he released his breath slowly there was virtually no response from the plant, but when he pulsed his breath through the nostrils, as he held a thought in mind, the plant would respond dramatically. 
- The plant's response was the same regardless of distance, as the results were the same when he was in San Jose (where his lab and the plant were), or in Prague, Czechoslovakia.  This also suggests that coherent thought acts similarly to coherent energy in that it can travel over long distances without loosing power.  
- Plants appeared to respond more to the threat of damage than to the actual damage itself.
- Plants appeared to have many of the same properties as batteries, especially when it came to their interactions with thoughts.
- It was observed that the attitude, or mind-set, of the experimenter had a measurable effect upon the test-results.  This might shed some light on the inconsistent result of the “water memory” experiments of Jacques Benveniste, as related previously.
- He concluded from these experiments that he “learned that there is energy connected with thought. Thought can be pulsed and the energy connected with it becomes coherent and has a laser-like power.”

Because of his young near-death-experience, Marcel believed that the greatest cohering agent is love.  This may be correct.  The tholonic view is that *intention* is the basis of reality and creation, but says nothing about what that intention *is*.  The tholonic position is that *any* intention is equally valid.  However, it's reasonable to imagine that some intentions are more effective than others, and it is reasonable that the intention of love may be the most sustainable.

Such ideas did not endear him to the scientific community, but this discovery opened many new doors of investigation for Marcel, especially in the areas of crystals and water, with some very impressive (anecdotal) results.  Needless to say, this not only set him apart from his fellow scientists, but ensured his obscurity.

## Maharishi Effect

Given the general direction of mainstream science, we do not see a lot of investigation into how thought affects external reality, but some research does  *(see items 3 and 4 in "Other Experiments" list below)*.  We will look at one research report here, *“Effects of Group Practice of the Transcendental Meditation Program on Preventing Violent Crime in Washington, D. C.: Results of the National Demonstration Project, June-July 1993”*[^160] published in the journal *“Social Indicators Research.”*

C., Alexander, Charles N., Shatkin, Susan F., Davies, John L., Hughes, Anne O., Ross, Emanuel, Orme-Johnson, David W., **Effects of Group Practice of the Transcendental Meditation Program on Preventing Violent Crime in Washington, D.C.: Results of the National Demonstration Project, June--July 1993,** Social Indicators Research,,8 June 01,1999 <https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1006978911496> Full report available at <http://www.istpp.org/crime_prevention>

This study and its 4,000 participant, which was monitored by a 27-member project review board comprised of independent scientists and Leading citizens, found that there was a significant statistical result.

What was this study exactly?

> This study presents the final results of a two-month prospective experiment to reduce violent crime in Washington, DC.  On the basis of previous research, it was hypothesized that the level of violent crime in the District of Columbia would drop significantly with the creation of a large group of participants in the Transcendental Meditation® and TM-Siddhi® programs to increase coherence and reduce stress in the District.[^161]

Here, the word “coherence” refers to its definition of “*the quality of forming a unified whole*.”

<img src='../Images/medchart.png' style='FLOAT:RIGHT;width:40%'/>The results were impressive.

This is only one study, so it is not definitive, but it is certainly supportive of the idea that directed intention, what the participants called *coherence*, and what we are calling *order* (as that is what unifies the parts into the whole), has an extended effect.  The explanation, according to the tholonic model, is that the directed energy of coherent thought alter the curves of various archetypes thereby altering the probability of where the “work” will produce the most order, or where and how energy will be expressed across a scope’s spectrum.

### On a Personal Note

I had a particularly insightful experience with the Maharishi Effect back in the late ’60s when I was a young teenager.  My father was a captain of industry in the world of electrical components, ultimately becoming president of one of the pioneering companies that helped create the first integrated circuit.

Born of poor Scottish immigrants in the Bronx on the tail of the Great Depression, and serving in Korea, he was no stranger to hard times and hard work, which made him one of the most pragmatic and practical people I have ever known.  He was a devout capitalist, atheist, and husband, and had no patience for anything that did not produce results.  Hippies were idiots, imports were ruining the economy, Scotch whiskey was better, and talking about your problems was for whiners.  You get the picture.

At the insistence of his wife (and my mother), he joined her for a seminar on *Creative Intelligence (CI)*, which was what they called Transcendental Meditation back then for those folks like my father.  He heard their claims about improved mental and physical health, better focus, fewer distractions, etc.  He decided to test their claims by giving all his employees in one of his factories CI training, along with an extra half-hour at lunch break for them to take this training and practice their new CI skills.

This factory was in a poor, rundown industrial town in New England, and the people that worked in those factories were uneducated, unskilled, assembly-line laborers - not exactly an open-minded demographic.  I knew a number of them myself, as we lived in that town, and many never made it past 4<sup>th</sup> grade.  The rivers in this town were dead from all the pollution, and the neighboring town had the highest *per capita* suicide rate in the United States.  It was a dreary, dark place filled with dreary, dark people.

His peers in the industry thought he was being foolish to deploy such a plan, but the results were astounding.  People were fighting less, taking less sick leave, injuries were down, production went up; in general, everything improved.  So much so, that the Wall Street Journal did an article on him and his “revolutionary” new technique.  He became known as some kind of New Age Industrialist, which was ironically funny as he was as new age as his ’57 Chevy.

Ultimately, this new concept was unsustainable in that environment because eventually people began to abuse the extra time meant for CI, and everything went back to *normal* with sick leaves, fighting, injuries, and lower production, so the program was scrapped.

## Prayer

You might be thinking that traditional prayer holds the same power, but the evidence migth suggest otherwise.  Why? Because most prayer is anything but coherent.  Prayer means very different things depending on culture, religion, personal perspectives, etc.  Perhaps this is a side-effect of monotheism, which eliminated the myriad of niche gods.  In any case, prayer can be anything from begging to demanding, justifying to virtue signaling, and occasionally it can be an expression of gratitude and love, but using group prayer to effect change is like using a group of blind people to paint a room by throwing handfuls of paint at the wall.  Your room *will* get painted, but you’ll wish it didn’t.

This was recently confirmed by a &dollar;2.3-million-dollar study on the effect of prayer on the sick, involving over 1,800 patients.  It was the largest study of its kind ever undertaken.  Contrary to prayer helping the sick, they found that when a patient knew others were praying for them, they tended to have *more* complications.[^162]

There are other studies that conclude the exact opposite, such as Dr. Byrd’s study “*Positive Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer in a Coronary Care Unit Population*”[^163] and Dr. Harris’s  study “*A Randomized, Controlled Trial of the Effects of Remote, Intercessory Prayer on Outcomes in Patients Admitted to the Coronary Care Unit*”[^164].  However, without a detailed comparison of the studies, and specifically the manner in which the participants prayed, we cannot know to what degree coherence was at play.

The difference between the coherence of Transcendental Meditation and prayer is the former follows a very specific set of rules, has a beginning, a middle and an end, has a clearly defined non-personal target subject, and never attempts to force change.  Prayer can follow these same rules, but it rarely does because there are no rules to prayer and varies greatly depending on culture, tradition, perspective, intention, etc.

The practice of *coherent prayer* is common among metaphysical secret societies.  For example, in the not-so-secret secret society of the *Order of the Rosy Cross*, or *Rosicrucians*,  members who have reached a certain level of initiation are introduced to a schedule of “prayers”. This is a globally synchronized schedule of times when people are requested to focus their energy on a particular topic, such as health or family or finances, and in a specific manner.  If one is not in need, they send their gratitude into a “pool” of energy specific to that topic.  If one has a need in these areas they can join in at the scheduled times and “tap into” that pool.  This is a very coherent technique because it has specific archetypes and directed energy, which then creates sustainable patterns, and it (reportedly) works surprisingly well.

The effect of the *Consciousness Field*, as it is referred to by Roger *Nelson* of Princeton University and director of *The Global Consciousness Project*, is not limited to humans, but can affect matter and machines *(see first two items listed below under “Other Experiments”).*

## Thought

If we are looking at meditation, prayer, and other forms of coherent thought, we have to also look at the concept of entropy because coherence is *lower* in entropy than incoherence, just as a laser light is lower in entropy that normal diffuse light.  This suggests that the act of meditation, prayer, concentration, focus, and even attention in general, creates a lower entropy state from a higher entropy state, which is contrary to the direction of entropy, at least according to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Law of Thermodynamics.  While the 2<sup>nd</sup> Law is not really a law but a statistical probability, the probability of breaking that law is extremely unlikely, so how can coherence of thought be possible?

**Another point regarding entropy**

- It needs to be pointed out that *entropy* is a property, a measure of the *total energy* in a system; the more *total energy*, the lower the *entropy*.  This *total energy* is technically called *enthalpy*.  However, we use the term *entropy* to represent the measure of *total energy* and the energy itself, or *enthalpy*.  This is the same as how we refer to physical material as *mass* rather than *matter*, as *matter* is the actual material, but *mass* is the measure of that *matter*.  A kilogram is *mass*, a kilogram of potatoes is *matter*. They are the same thing, but referenced differently, that is, until we get into the bizarre outliers of quantum and relativistic phenomena where *massless matter* exists, but as we don’t normally exist in wormholes, we will conveniently ignore this exception.  *Massless matter* is not to be confused with *massless particles*, such as photons.  The concept of a *massless particle* was born when Einstein proclaimed “light consists of spatially random particles”, which was a poor choice of words, but that was in 1905, so he didn’t have a lot of options given the scientific vocabulary of the day.  We all know that mass means matter, and the point of this book is to try and  communicate ideas to the readers, not to confuse them.  Additionally, because we are using the concept of *entropy* outside of its strictly thermodynamic context, the concept of *enthalpy* becomes even more confusing.  A compressed JPG or ZIP file image has high *entropy*, so, does that means it has less *enthalpy*?  What does that even mean in the context of JPG images and ZIP files?  An uncompressed file has more *total energy* than an zipped file? Perhaps, but we won’t be going near such concepts.  *Applying* enthalpy to consciousness would get even more obtuse and confusing, especially as we have no idea of what the “energy of consciousness” is and certainly no idea how to measure it.

From a thermodynamic perspective, focus, concentration, prayer, etc., only uses 5% of the calories needed to power the brain, or 0.65 calories an hour, at most, and no matter how hard you concentrate, which means a single chocolate chip cookie could power a year’s worth of meditation or focused attention if someone meditated 20 minutes a day, and yet focused thinking is what accounts for pretty much everything mankind has created since he thought “hmm… I wonder if farming is easier than hunting and gathering?” and started the *Neolithic Revolution* that changed humanity forever.  It was not the 0.65 cal/hr our hunter/gatherer ancestors spent coming up with that idea that challenged the 2<sup>nd</sup> Law; it was the consequences of the idea.  If one happened to reach enlightenment during a meditation we certainly would not say they achieved 2.7214 watts (which is 0.65 calories) of enlightenment. 

This brings us back to the question “How can a system become more organized in an ever increasingly chaotic system?”.  This argument is called the *Schrödinger paradox*, as it was introduced to the world by Erwin Schrödinger in 1933 in his book “What is Life?”.  But, Schrödinger had the answer (it’s not clear why it is called a paradox considering the question is rhetorical, making it more of a *Schrödinger’s rhetoric*).  We briefly touched on this earlier, but here is a paraphrased version of Schrödinger’s explanation:

The 2<sup>nd</sup> Law only applies to *closed* systems, where no energy can enter or leave.  Life, at least on Earth, is an *open* system, as we get lots of energy from the Sun, and our solar system is an open system as it gets energy from the galaxy.  In practical terms , the Universe as a whole is the only closed system (that we know of) in nature.  So, the evolution and self-organizing of life *appears* to break the 2<sup>nd</sup> Law, but doesn’t *really* because it’s getting more energy from the Sun than it expends evolving and self-organizing.  This is called *free-energy* or *negentropy* (negative entropy), a term coined by Schrödinger in the same book.  The reason he coined the word rather than just saying “negative entropy” is because he did not feel that simply adding a “-” in front of “entropy” captured the remarkable ability of living systems to seemingly violate the 2<sup>nd</sup> law by lowering their entropy and increasing organization, order, and structure.[^418]

[^418]: Ho, Mae-Wan, “**What is (Schrödinger's) Negentropy?**”, Modern Trends in BioThermoKinetics 3, 50-61, 199, https://www.i-sis.org.uk/negentr.php

This tells us that a system can self-organize as long as the reduction local entropy is less than the free-energy it receives.  And why *would* any system self-organize in the first place?  Because whatever anything is organizing into, it does so only because it is a more efficient structure for the distribution and preservation of energy, as we saw back in *Chapter 4* where Jeremy England of M.I.T. explained how hydrocarbon-based blobs can turn into a life form.

Schrödinger was speaking about things like evolution and solar/cosmic energy, but thermodynamically speaking, we have more than enough extra energy just from the calories we consume to “power” coherent thought.  So, if we have the energy, and coherent thought is so easy to produce, why don’t we not all have super-coherent consciousness?

One reason has to do with our neurology, which is not only still evolving, but whose  primary task is *not* to develop or enhance consciousness but to “*encode and integrate information acquired from the environment through sensory inputs, and then generate adaptive behavioral responses*”[^414].  Consciousness is more of a consequential side-effect as a result of our ability to recognize relationships between things, thanks to the relatively new parts of our brains called the *frontoparietal networks*[^415].  Within this network is the crowning achievement of evolution[^416], the *cerebral neocortex*, which, due to its increasing complexity, formed interneuronal networks within networks until one day it was able to process the relationship between “I” and “Not I”, and voilà , “I Am” became a very big thing.  While out new and improved brain give us the ability to apply conscious intention to direct our brain to focus at will, we need to focus our attention in order to make the brain focus our attention.  

Another (highly speculative) reason is that consciousness as an instance of A&I, and even though A&I is energy, it is a different kind of energy that operates in a different scope and context.  Science has no tools to detect it or measure it, and therefore, it doesn’t exist, because accepting the accepted scientific axiom that that&hellip;

> Regardless whether something exists or not, something is real when it is a necessary ingredient of a theory that correctly describes what we observe.

we are also accepting the premise that&hellip;
> Regardless whether something exists or not, something is not real if it doesn’t conform to our theories.

In the tholonic view, this other form of energy would conform to the laws of energy as they apply to this different context, so we would expect there to be some form of entropy, in which case we could apply Schrödinger’s reasoning and suggest that consciousness is an open system receiving free-energy from the Source A&I, and given that consciousness is a contextual instance of A&I, we can also understand it as the result of the need to dissipate the free-energy of the A&I we are exposed to, just as the carbon-based blobs were exposed to energy.  

This is not that radical of an idea, as it is the same concept of how matter is a very slowed-down or rudimentary instance of energy.  Here it is being suggested that energy, as we know it, is itself a limited instance of an even finer form of energy that instantiates as consciousness and while non-physical in nature, is influenced, limited, and reformed by the context of our neurology.

**Entropy-debt**

There is another related idea that is also a highly speculative concept which relates to the above, and that is the idea of *entropy-debt*.  This is similar to Schrödinger’s concept of *negentropy*, but *entropy-debt* is more of a tholonic view that also addresses the issues of  consciousness and time.

Farming is a particularly good example to describe this idea because it is a good example of creating a lower entropy process of food procurement, which is exemplified in comparing the order and structure of the hunter-gatherer work environment to the modern farmer’s work environment.

<center><img src='../Images/farming.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Simply by planting the food or raising the livestock one would otherwise have to forage or hunt not only required significantly less calories[^413], but the less productive calories of the less-fit members of the community could now contribute more value to the community-at-large, and the output was potentially far greater with lower risk (“potentially” because early farming was less productive than hunting/gathering, but was still less work, less risk, and socially stabilizing).  By all measures, the entropy of food procurement was dramatically reduced as production became more ordered and structured.  However, if we consider that the introduction of farming also introduced many changes, such as the concept of property rights, population growth, military prowess, and more, all of which led to more complex forms of government, accounting, trade, and war, it could easily be argued that the loss of entropy that farming delivered was more than compensated for.  Of course, these consequences took many years to develop, during which time there was a *entropy-debt*, but a debt that  was balanced by the increased entropy of the consequence of this entropy-reducing invention.

The idea behind *entropy-debt* is that while we accept that entropy will always increase, under certain conditions it can decrease as long as the consequences of that decrease are guaranteed to create more entropy than what was reduced.  It is similar to a bank loan, where you get money you don’t have, but end up repaying it over time.  The difference is with entropy-debt, it is the laws of creation that guarantee the balance.  The “certain conditions” restrictions is that *entropy-debt* cannot exist between interactions of instances, i.e., between energy and matter, which is why we will never see this in the material world, but it can exist between archetypes and instances, or between A&I and the material world.   The reason it can exist in the world of archetypes is because it is there that the pure laws, free of any contextual limits, exist.  If a law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, then whatever the action is, there *will* be an equal and opposite reaction.  In the case of matter, it will instantiate as force=mass &times; acceleration, and in the world of instances there is no entropy-debt as the exchange must be instant as all the participants are instances exist in the same scope and context of space-time.  The world of archetypes and ideas does not share the same space-time context as space and time are merely concepts or dimensions in the world of archetypes.  In the world of archetypes, the effect is as guaranteed as the existence of a cause, as both exist simultaneously.   2+2 is simultaneously equal to 4, regardless how long it takes someone to discover that fact.  

In the example of farming, a decrease in entropy will simultaneously create and/or accelerate a number of archetypes that will use that extra entropy, even though it may take years for those archetypes to instantiate, but that is a function of time that only matters in the material world.

What this implies is that every idea that increases order and reduces entropy will eventually create more chaos and disorder.  Schrödinger (again) made a parallel observation when he specifically commented on how the order we humans create  seems to make more chaos (as in the farming example above):

> we witness the event that existing order displays the power of maintaining itself and of producing orderly events. That sounds plausible enough, though in finding it plausible we, no doubt, draw on experience concerning social organization and other events which involve the activity of organisms. And so it might seem that something like a vicious circle is implied. - [a dragon biting its tail, the Oroboros]

This makes perfect send if we consider that the more energy is distributed, the more opportunity (microstates) there is for (high-entropy) chaos to form, and as order is a transitional condition or state of chaos, (low-entropy) chaos will always manifest before order forms, and order will always create more (high-entropy) chaos.

In a way, we see this delayed reaction of entropy-debt in our reality now, as the “instant” reaction to a cause it not actually “instant”, but it is at the speed of light, which *is* the speed of cause and effect.  Energy leaves the Sun as its entropy increases.  8.3 minutes later, that energy lowers the entropy of the Earth.  It’s like an *entropy-credit* (i.e, *free-energy*,  *negentropy*,  *negative entropy*), but Earth doesn’t get the credit for 8.3 minutes, but the credit is as guaranteed to arrive as the Sun is guaranteed to shine… even more so, in fact, as the Sun could blink out after the energy was released and we’d still receive it (even if we are extinguished moments later).  

Of course, in our time-limited reality, this delayed reaction always moves from cause to effect, or so we assume, but there is evidence to suggest otherwise.  While there has been some debunking (the validity of which I can’t attest to) of John Wheeler's *Delayed Choice Experiment* when it comes to changing the *states* of quanta in the past, there is no doubt that the experiment proves you can change the *actions* of the quanta in the past.

Here is a transcript of an interview with John Wheeler speaking about his experiment:

> One of the most remarkable features of nature is that a Quantum can pursue two different routes through two different slits, come together, and manifest itself as a single quantum.  But nothing prevents one from saying that the quantum might be a photon, to speak of quantum of radiation, or it might be an electron, to speak of a particle.  A quantum can go both routes, or it can go a single route.  And it's possible to choose which after the particle has already made its travel.  You choose after the particle has decided whether it's going both routes or one route, and after it's got through, you yourself decide which it shall have done.  You seem to intervene to change the past.  But quantum theory says it can be done.  And I had the pleasure to spell out some of the features of such an experimental arrangement.  My University of Maryland colleague, Carroll Alley, made changes in the experiment, but without changing the principle, and carried it out.  And it checked, so that we now know it is indeed true that one can decide, at the quantum level, whether an object shall go two routes to get to its final point or just one route.  You can make the decision after it's already made the trip.  That sounds like a contradiction, but it works.[^417]**~John Wheeler**

John Wheeler is one of those “trusted sources” who has been to “Australia”, so if he says it’s there, then it’s there.  And if it *is* there, then that means delayed reaction works in both directions, and that means, just like there is an *entropy-credit*, there can be an *entropy-debt*, even if all we have been able to see is just a tiny bit for a moment in time.

[^413]:S. Bowles, **“Cultivation of cereals by the first farmers was not more productive than foraging”**. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108, 4760–4765 (2011).

Incoherence is nature’s first choice when it comes to the distribution and balancing of energy, but we can find examples of coherent transmissions of energy as well, mainly between molecules involved with photosynthesis, microtubules, quantum energy transfer, and possibly mitochondria, bacteria, and plant chloroplasts (part of plant cell that converts light into chemical energy).  This natural coherence is more common  to the micro-world, and is also of very short duration, but it exists because it is a far more efficient way to transfer a specific amount and type of energy to a specific target.  Just as the energy emissions of the blob required a more organized, more structured, more coherent pattern to efficiently move energy, molecular and quantum processes also require a more coherent and efficient form of energy transfer for the same reason.  

If we accept this new theory of life, then we also have to accept that the evolution of life, which includes DNA information storage and retrieval systems, is also a by-product of, and for, the movement of energy, and that sounds like a pretty big leap.  However, examples of this claim are self-assembling crystals and quasi-crystals (structures that act like crystals but do not look like crystals) and are the subject of much research.  DNA self-assembles in the same manner, and many self-assembling quasi-crystals *are* DNA.  

Now consider that the primary function of anything that exists is to remain in existence, to maintain a stable pattern of energy distribution within the context of its existence.  Our hydrocarbon-based blobs could only evolve into life after they created a synergetic relationship with its surrounding; i.e., it will need to consume or assimilate resources and contribute something of equal or more value back to its context or environment, and the information is passed on via DNA.

Schrödinger also observed that: 

> An organism's astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos - of 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environment - seems to be connected with the presence of the 'aperiodic solids', the chromosome molecules, which doubtless represent the highest degree of well-ordered atomic association we know of&hellip;

In other words, the ability for living organisms to increase coherence, reduce dispersion, (i.e., reduce entropy) seems to be connected with the quasi-crystals of DNA (i.e. information).

It is the DNA of life forms that determines how it will manage not only the sustainability of an organism, but also the transmission of energy, especially *free-energy*, and as all the organs, including the brain, come into existence and grow in accordance with the rules recorded in the DNA.  We can then say that the entire organism and its parts exist because of the DNA that is designed to optimize existing energy and dissipate excess energy.

If we are constantly being “energized” or “irradiated” by the omnipresence of A&I, how are we dissipating all the excess “energy” we are exposed to?  Through increasingly complex systems of dissipation, such as consciousness, meta-consciousness, and the systems they “self-assemble”. “Self-assemble” is in quotes because from a Universal perspective, everything that did, does, or will exist is self-assembled.

As pattern and order become more complex, interconnected, and efficient, coherent exchange of energy will become more common, not unlike the ever-evolving *frontoparietal networks* from which consciousness emerged.  Rain is a very efficient and  incoherent way to distribute water, and in the past, humans would hope for rain to water the plants that they foraged.  Coherent attempts were made to invoke the rain, such as praying, dancing, and sacrificing.  Regardless as to to the viability of such techniques, they have been around for at least 10,000 years, even among cultures that had developed writing and record-keeping[^419].   Eventually, humans created far more coherent and efficient techniques that resulted in far more coherent efficient production, such as irrigation, water management, dry farming techniques, and technology.

We are partons to a larger tholon. It is our ability to transfer coherent energy, with technology and with thought, that makes us part of the energy distribution system of that larger system, but more than that, we are that part of this larger system because of the movement of energy in that larger system has evolved to the point where it needs to produce coherent distribution of energy, and as energy is Awareness and Intentions, that translates to “the intentional directing of consciousness”.

## Structured Water

Given how water seems to be such a good tholonic medium, can we lower the entropy of water by increasing its order,  adding structure in a way that matches and/or enhances the patterns of the thologram and see some differences in how it transmits or interacts with energy? If we do see any differences, then we have another piece of potential evidence that supports the tholonic model.

As it happens, there is such a thing as *structured water*.  *Coherent* or *Structured* water, for those who are not familiar with the term, is regular water that has been modified to give it more structure or pattern, specifically in the way that the water molecules are arranged in relation to one another, or so it is claimed.

OK, I know I probably lost some of the readers with this last sentence.  If you do an Internet search of “structured water” one of the first results you will get is the Wikipedia entry that begins with “structured water is a term used in a marketing scam” and although that is true to the extent that anything can be a scam in the hands of scammers, the entry says nothing whatsoever on the research and testing that has been done regarding the use of structured water.

To the dogmatically skeptical, anything that challenges the current world view is “swarming with worms of heretical perversity”. It doesn’t matter if a new idea, in this case, structured water, has vast amounts of scientific research and support from highly accredited professionals and ample evidence one can find by researching the pioneers and leaders in the field, many with a lifetime of contributions and dozens of Chairs, Fellows, and Adjuncts with Accolades of their life’s work[^78], as well as hundreds of papers and dozens of books related to and supporting the structured water phenomena.  Skepticism has its place and serves a critical purpose, but regarding the extreme skepticism of structured water, that purpose does not seem to be moving understanding forward or seeking new solutions to real-world problems, such as solving global water shortage problems and increasing crop production, as has been well documented by some of Australia’s largest produce farms.

To see the result of my own tests and how to make structured water, see *Appendix J: Structured Water*.

[^78]: See resources at <http://hexagonalwater.com> for more information.

There is quite a lot of good research on the subject that we won’t detail here, but if you want to learn more a good place to start is Fabian Ptok’s Masters theses *“Alternative Irrigation Methods: Structured Water in the context of a Growing Global Food Crisis due to Water Shortages”*[^79], which covers the subject well from an agricultural and security perspective but also has a number of references to the researchers and work going on in this area.  One of the often cited studies showed dramatic results in decreasing blood and DNA damage in diabetic rats, but this study is also criticized as it was small[^303] . There is also a book by Professor Gerald Pollack, who has an impressive list of credentials[^304], and is available online for free[^80] (which I have not read, so this is not an endorsement or recommendation).  Another good source is the work of Marcel Vogel (more on him later) who claimed that through years of work and thousands of experiments he was able to prove that various forms of energy, including thought, could permanently change the spectrographic properties of water, [^301] and that water was an information storage system.  This last claim is especially significant considering Vogel was not only a chemical and physics researcher at IBM for 27 years, but he was an information medium specialist, holding patents of hard-drive memory technologies that are in use to this day.

<img src="../Images/116-water-ice.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>Water is a particularly good test medium because the structure of molecular water is tetrahedral, and being the most basic shape of creation lends itself to many different tholonic applications.  It’s worth noting that when it was originally suggested that water might be tetrahedral in shape back in 1938 the idea was met with disbelief.  It was not until 80 years later, in 2013, that this was finally accepted as valid.  Today “it is widely accepted that liquid water structure is comprised of two closely interweaved components; i.e.  tetrahedral and hexagonal structures”.[^81]In fact, water, as ice, may be the closest instance of the entire tholonic structure of any other substance (that is common to us).  *(image above from “Tetrahedrality is key to the uniqueness of water”[^82])*

The *silicate structures* of minerals are also quiet similar in that they are made up of tetrahedrons of various arrangements.  In fact, the structure of water and quartz is so close that in some conditions ice has the same (or really similar) structure as quartz[^302]!      In fact, the word “crystal” comes form the Greek word *krustallos*, meaning both “ice” and “rock crystal, because they believed quartz was permanently frozen water.  This lends some credence to the metaphysical and ancient idea that water and quartz have a special relationship.

Radical ideas are often met with radical resistance.  Structured water is one of those ideas, and it falls into the same New Age category as “crystal power”.   Ignoring the 249D crystal that (possibly) created reality, common crystals do have some pretty impressive qualities.  

- Generate electricity (piezoelectric).

- Amplify, transmit, and store data (up to 300 million years [^342]).

- Generate signals (used in microchips, watches, internet routers and network controllers, satellites, up to billions of cycles per second).

- Control the transmission and phase of of light (liquid crystal displays - LCDs, )

- Ability to alter time (yes! they are called *time crystals*, and they represent a new state of matter, according to MIT.[^343]

- Ability to hold a magnetic charge.

The reason crystals can do all these amazing things is because of the structure of the elements that make a crystal, and water, with its tetrahedral structure, is like a form of liquid crystal.  As we have stated, energy creates order, and movement is the effect of energy, therefore, adding energy via movement to a tetrahedral liquid, such as water, will  have some positive or reinforcing effect on its structure, and that structure, being a more efficient conduit for transferring energy, will likewise have an effect on that which interacts with it by transferring more energy.

The hypothesis is then, simply by causing movement to commercial water (tap or bottled) we should see measurable effects.

In Ptok’s Master’s thesis mentioned above, the author examines various tests that grew different plants using tap water and structured water.

<center><img src='../Images/095-ptolks-images.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One of his findings was that using structured water increased alfalfa growth by 15.1%.  This may not sound like much, but in the U.S. alone a 15% increase in alfalfa growth represents an additional 20,700,000 tons of alfalfa, which has a value of over 4 billion dollars.

Similarly, some of Australia’s largest produce farms have reported needing 25% less water to produce a superior product than with traditional water.  This is a perfect example of how the simple enhancement of order at the most fundamental level can have radical changes up the chain.  These dramatic results were achieved with only one change to one element in one application.

In the tholonic model, this example also applies to ideas, concepts, and intelligence;  small changes in one area can have radical consequences in the world of ideas, and of course, ideologies.

**Review of studies**

There have been a number of studies of SW using animals.  One review does a meta-analysis of these studies, “Structured Water: effects on animals”. [^322]

[^322]: Lindinger, Michael. (2021). **Structured Water: effects on animals**. Journal of Animal Science. 99. 10.1093/jas/skab063.  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349669391_Structured_Water_effects_on_animals

> This review focuses on the effects of structured water on animals when it is consumed on a daily basis. Structured water is liquid water that is given altered H-bonding structure by treatment with various forms of energy including magnetic fields and light. While most of the research has been conducted on magnetized‘ water, which has structure of short duration, recent research has examined effects of a structured water with stability of at least 3.5 months.

**Conclusion**:

>  The animal research conducted to date consistently demonstrated beneficial effects of SW consumption.

<img src='../Images/bullied_plant.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>There is another conclusion that also needs to be looked at, and that is not just the inability for some people to accept such findings, but their need to attack the findings.  An example of this is the very simple “experiment” produced by IKEA where they placed 2 identical plants side by side for 30 days in many K-12 GEMS (Global Education Management Systems[^420]) schools across the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E).  Signs near each plant instructed viewer to either “compliment” the plant (right) or “bully” the plant (left).  The short YouTube video[^421] had 1.2 million views, with 6,700 likes and 625 dislikes, and many of the comments were as vile as YouTube will allow.  Granted, this exhibition will never get publisher in the *Journal for Experimental Science*, but it is certainly sufficient to raise the question “Do emotions effect life?”, which sounds like a ridiculously silly question, as we all know the answer to that, but while there are countless studies on the effect of plants on human emotions, there is nary a one (that I can find) on the effects of human emotions on plants.  This is unfortunate, as such a study would tell us a lot about the emotions/biology connection that presumably would have some effect among the often emotionally chaotic, fear-driven, culturally distorted minds of humans.  Unfortunately, the anger and dismissive attitudes expressed in the comments of this video are shared by to many leaders in the scientific community, which can, at times, be more of a cult of scientism.

## Qualitative Energy

One experiment to consider is the concept of *qualitative energy*.  We have countless ways to test the quantitative properties of energy, but if we are claiming that quantitative and qualitative properties are related in some way, then can one property effect the other, for example, via induction?  

Measuring the value of money is quantitative, so a \$10 bill is always \$10 regardless if it came from a blood diamond or a farmer, but many people would reject that \$10 if they knew it was from blood diamonds &hellip;a qualitative value that had significant quantitative effects as it has shifted over $1,000,000,000 away from the blood diamond industry.  Does that make the value of the money qualitative?  Subjectively, perhaps, but not objectively because all legal tender is centrally controlled by the State in a manner that removes all qualitative value.  In addition, the State has made it illegal to create a new forms of money.  But this is not the case in the cryptocurrency world.  There are currencies whose value is hugely influenced by the service they provide, such as cryptocurrencies specifically bound to agriculture (SOYA, CORA, WHEA), precious metals (XAUT, DGX, GLC, PMGT, LKNS), marijuana (POT, CANN, DOPE), and even pornography (PORNCOIN).  There are coins based on political and ideological goals, such as privacy (XRP), candidates (FJB, LGB), religions (BBP, CT).  There are more that 19,000 cryptocurrencies at the time of this writing, each with their own underlying philosophy, vision, goals, and values. These new infant currencies demonstrate the bond between quantitative and qualitative values, and how each of these two qualities can induce changes in the other.

By the same token (pun intended), and because money is a abstract representation of energy, we can extend this idea to energy in general and ask “can qualitative attributes effect quantitative measure, or visa versa?”, “Is there such a thing as qualitative induction?”

For example, a simple test could be performed with two vases of identical water. One vase can be subjected to constructive emotions, sounds, etc, while the others are subjected to destructive emotions, sounds etc.  This water is then used to water two identical plants.  Any difference in the plant’s growth might be attributable to the “quality” of the water.  

Why not simply expose the plants to such emotions?  Because the use of the tholonically compatible substance of water as a storage medium is the real test.  How, or if, the water effects plants is really the testing of the idea.  The question of whether plants are sensitive to any non-physical or non-electromagnetic stimulus remains, but we can look to the existing theories and tests to find that answer.  One such experiment is “The Florence Experiment” where bean plants accompanied a human as they slid down a 20 meter slide installed in the *Palazzo Strozzi* Renaissance palace of art in Florence, Italy.   This exhibit was put together by plant neurobiologist Professor Stefano Mancuso, founder of the study of plant neurobiology that studies the intelligence of plants, and German artist and former entomology researcher with a Ph.D. in Phytopathology, Carsten Höllerm.  

The idea was to see how plants responded to the emotions of “fun” and “exciting”.  This experiment was followed with another experiment where plants were exposed to people watching horror films.  Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I have yet to hear back from the producers of this experiment who I reached out to in June of 2022.

It would not be surprising if the results confirmed that plants respond to emotions.  In fact, it would be surprising if they did not, as plants, being the very bridge between the source of energy for this planet (Sun) and life on this planet, must be of a very high order of intelligence, at least according to the tholonic definition of intelligence of “The ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of energy within the scope of its existence.” and the tholonic claim that “Intelligence exists in anything that has a sustainable pattern of energy.”, because plants are not only far more sustainable than all other forms of life, no other form of life is sustainable without them. 

But even the traditional definition of intelligence of “The ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or *trying* situations.” applies because the creation of life on a dead planet is about as *trying* as it gets.  We can take it further with the traditional definition of intelligence of “The ability to learn, understand, and make judgments or have opinions that are based on reason.” if we presume the tholonic intelligence that instantiated in plant life has the ability to learn, understand, make judgments, reason and even have opinions.  Now, apply the tholonic definition of “understanding”, i.e., “the knowledge of something sufficient enough to be able to make verifiably accurate statements regarding said thing”, and we can also claim that a tholon has knowledge, as every form of life is accurately described by the knowledge data-storage medium of RNA/DNA (which may have existed long before life itself).

Note that the tholonic definition of intelligence&hellip;

> The ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of energy within the scope of its existence.


&hellip; implicitly includes the traditional definitions, and where “reason” extends beyond current human reasoning.  As patterns come from order, which is the result of energy, and energy is awareness, then, by this reasoning, intelligence is synonymous with “ordered or structured awareness.”

Mancuso claim that plants *are* intelligent is quite compatible with the tholonic model, as is even Charles Darwin’s, albeit contextually limited by the world-view of the 1870s .

> “it’s hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle (the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination) thus endowed, and having the power of directing movements of the adjoining parts, acts like a brain of one of the lower animals.”  **~Charles Darwin, “The Power of Movement in Plants” (1880)**

What is surprising is that our current world-view continues to be based on the erroneous concepts passed down by the likes of Aristotle, who wrote in “De Anima”, that plants have a “low level”, “vegetative soul” because they are incapable of local movement and ability to sense.  Like his claims about gravity, both statements are observably wrong, even to the ancient Greeks, had he bothered to actually investigate.

## Language and Metaphysics

It is well known that language has the power to hold a social order together, or to destroy it.  Language has such power because the order and hierarchy of concepts that form a social order are known, taught and defined by words.  In addition, words and language actually form neurological pathways in our brain, and these pathways exert physiological pressure in the physical structure of the language processing part of the brain.  The brilliant linguist Noam Chomsky, in his *Generative-transformational Theory* of language, states that children are born with the hard-wired understanding of language, and the only thing they need to learn is the context of how that innate understanding is culturally expressed.  

Anecdotal to Chomsky’s point, my son was never taught to read or write, raised in a house without TV, radio, or internet, and in a rural environment.  He was exposed to a Rudolf Steiner-esq form of learning where he was not “taught”, but rather “exposed”, allowing his innate knowledge to manifest at its natural pace.  When he entered public school at the age of 8 or 9,  his reading and writing abilities far exceeded those of his classmates. 

It must be stated that while the first casualty of war may be truth, the first act of war is an attack on language and words, which begins long before the shooting starts.  One example of such a salvo aimed at Western Culture is the post-modern concept of language and the redefining of words.  This very successful neo-Marxist offensive began in the 1960s and has been so successful that by 2022 even a U.S, Supreme Court Justice was unable to define the word “woman”, and this view was staunchly supported by the largest publishing company in the U.S., who unironically reported “[her] answer was scientifically sound. There is no sufficient way to clearly define what makes someone a woman.”[^358]

Words and language are fundamental to psychology, communications, behavior, culture, cognition, relationships, perception, identity, politics, and just about all aspects of a society.  Consequently, it’s challenging to describe ideas that use concepts that are outside our vernacular.  The only solution is to define new concepts and create new words for them. Last year, 20 new words were added to the dictionary including “ecoanxiety” , “Dunning-Kruger”, “hodophobia” (fear of traveling), “nothingburger”, “ratio” (as in “dude, you got ratio-ed”; likes/dislikes of a social media post).  The words we create, and how we use words in general, might be a good indicator as to where society is headed.  At least that is the concept behind the study of “predictive linguistics”.  The problem with predictive linguistics, and words/language in general, is that each person’s different experience with words invokes a different qualitative context[^357], so, even if everyone agrees on what the word “walk” means, it does not mean that word will invoke the same subjective context, and the context will determine the psychological, emotional, typically unconscious or “right brain” meaning of that word.  All of us have experienced this, usually with scents, places, or things, but it applies to words/language as well.

Scientific or technical words are the easiest to create because they can be clearly and definitively described.  Words to convey emotions or beliefs are harder as they are subjective, but as we all have feelings and beliefs, we can all generally agree on words like “love”, “fear”, “spirit”, “freedom”, but the specifics of these words will never be agreed upon.  It’s even harder to define new words for existential or esoteric concepts, such as “awareness”, “consciousness”, “soul”, “god”, or the metaphysical aspects of concepts like “intention”, “free-will”, “being”.  The most challenging concepts to describe are those that are technical, emotional, and metaphysical, such as the concept of energy. Energy is everything that is, can be, and will ever be, and by everything, I mean *everything*, which includes consciousness and awareness, intentions, cause and effect, space-time, spirit, soul, free-will, and literally anything else you, or anyone who ever did, is, or will live, can imagine.

In order to describe such things we can invent new words, but unless you are a cultural icon, world leader, or brilliant scientist who has the support of the media, your new words will remain a mystery.   Many new words are serendipitous, as they were accidentally created , such as the word “malapropism” (nonsensical, often humorous utterance), which is an adaptation of the name of a character, Mrs. Malaprop, from the 1775 play “The Rivals”.  Even the word “serendipity” itself was invented by writer and politician Horace Walpole in 1754 as an allusion to *Serendip*, an old name for Sri Lanka.  “banana republic”, “catch-22”, “bedazzled”, “beatnik”, “cyberspace”, are all invented words that found a home in the collective consciousness of our culture because we could all recognize and agree on their meaning and agree that it filled a need.  To create a new word that describes a state of understanding, we can look to Robert Heinlein, who had to write an entire book (“Stranger in a Strange Land”, 1961) to describe the nuanced definition of the word “grok”, and even then, the definition has been drastically reduced to a simple sentence; “To understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with; also, to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment".

Short of inventing new words, we can use existing words as representative, symbolic, metaphorical allusions to describe metaphysical, supernatural, or existential concepts.  Some languages are better suited for this, so we can appropriate their words into our vernacular, such as “chi”, “chakras”,“Tao”, gestalt”, “karma”, “mantra”, “yoga”, “prana”.

How, then, can we talk about such broad and illusive concepts as A&I in a way that can be understood by all? The best we can do is use the simplest words possible, leaving less room for wildly differing interpretations.   At the most fundamental level, A&I can be described as “I Am” and “I Will”.  It doesn’t get more basic that that, but as we’ll see, these concepts are anything but simple.

In the thologram, we have the concept of a 0-dimensional point which only has 2 attributes, A&I.  Linguistically, the singularity of that point can only be described as that which “is”, and the nothingness in which it resides, is that which “is not”. This is the first duality of *somethingness* and *nothingness* which describes a state of existence or “being”.  Applied to subjective or 1<sup>st</sup> person context of “to be”, these would be “Not I” and “I am”, or, to borrow the opening words of the most widely known and quoted lines in modern English literature:

> “To be, or not to be” **~“Hamlet”, William Shakespeare, 1600**

We now have these 3 objective concepts, “is not”, “is”, and “to be”.  These concepts are instances of (or lack of) Awareness, as the only prerequisite for some “thing” to exist is the awareness of its existence, even if that “thing” is a 0 dimensional dot.  Here, a “thing” can be no more that a concept, and that concept can even be the concept of awareness!  For something to exist, it does not need any other qualifier other than “to be”.  It doesn’t need to “do” anything, nor does it need a purpose, reason, or rationale to exist.  In the context of Intention, “is not”, “is”, and “I am” become “will not”, “will be”, and “I will”, and the only qualifier that “will be” requires is an intention to “to be”.

This should sound familiar as we briefly touched on the same theme in Chapter 7, *Structure*.  This association between the thologram and ancient spiritual concepts was never intended, but it was inevitable as both paths are based on the same laws of existence.

<img src='../Images/iamtri.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>Awareness is the primal state of existence and instantiates as consciousness, which in the human context is “I”. Intention is the primal force which created the primal movement, the 1<sup>st</sup> cause that started the chain reaction of causes and effects instantiates as movement/energy and “I will”.  

Regardless that these concepts have been, and continue to be, hotly debated as to their true meaning, they are the most fundamental and simple of concepts that we have yet to conceive of.  They also match our original tholonic trinity of the N-state/Negotiation/balance (“I/is”), Definition/limitation (“I am/to be”), and Contribution/form (“I Will/will be”).

Language not only dictates cultural values and beliefs, it is inextricably linked to the formation of human consciousness[^422]<sup>,</sup>[^424]<sup>,</sup>[^427] .  This suggests that the limitation of languages will be reflected in limitations of consciousness (and visa versa).  For example, along with our brain’s high evolved *frontoparietal networks* ability to conceive of the concept of “I” was the conception of “Not I”.  These concepts are very effective in helping the brain do what is has evolved to do, which is “*encode and integrate information acquired from the environment through sensory inputs, and then generate adaptive behavioral responses*”.  The reason such concepts could even be conceived in the first place is because the most fundamental reasoning process in any brain is to distinguish between “that which is” vs “that which is not”.  A bee knows “this is (a flower)” from “this is not (a flower)” and even ants have shown they can recognize themselves in a mirror[^425] (which is not the same as having a concept of “I”, although they clearly have a concept of “us”, or rather, the individual ants act like neurons in a collective brain, or superorganism ^[426]).

Even the simplest form of life that exists, the “JCVI-syn3.0”, a man-made cell with only 473 genes[^423], “knows” how to differentiate between “what is” and “what is not”, and does so much better than the scientists who created this first designer organism in history.  We know this because there are 79 genes in this organism that are required for the cell to continue living, but no one has any idea why they are there or what they do.  The organism “knows” they need to exist, otherwise it would not have created them in the first place.

It is reasonable, then, to presume that the simplest relationship that can be recognized is  between that which “is” and that which “is not”, so the concept of “I/Not I” would be the first relationship that the *frontoparietal networks* could form once it conceived of “I”, and given that this concept has been around for about 5 million years, it has a pretty good track record of “*generating adaptive behavioral responses*”.  The “problem” with the concept of “I/Not I” is that it is based on, or rather an evolution of, the fundamental concept of existence, that of “is/not is”, which is built into all life.  This makes sense as far as rules of logic go, but that does not mean it has anything to do with reality.   Reality, as far as the brain is concerned, is whatever it can logically deduce from experience and the senses (of which only 5 get any attention, thanks to Aristotle).  A more objective view of reality tells us that it is the culmination of all that came before and the current state of an ever changing system that has been around for 4.5 billion years.  While logic may be a part of reality, just as order is a part of chaos, that does not mean that all of reality abides by the rules of whatever limited version of logic the brain has so far deduced.  Consequently, that which “is not” is that which does not exist, therefore when there is no more I, “I” ceases to exist, and “I”, being purely a utilitarian construct of the *frontoparietal network* which is only interested in “*generating adaptive behavioral responses*”, can only conclude that the end of “I” is death, as “Not I” is the end of existence.  While it is true in the sense that the brain’s existence comes to an end, from a tholonic view, it is virtually impossible for the tholonic intelligence of one’s existence to come to an end.

Such concepts are reinforced and passed on via language, which forms our human consciousness and understanding of reality, which is why humans have a tendency to believe that death is the end of our existence.  Metaphorically speaking, the brain (and body in general), is like an organic form of artificial intelligence whose primary objective is self-preservation, so we should expect that everything it creates is designed to support that agenda.

We can’t blame the *frontoparietal network* for doing its very impressive job, especially as it has also managed to create meta-physical concepts of some kind of relationship with a something beyond our physical reality (in spite of Aristotle's attempts at thwarting).  These concepts appeared shortly after (~2 million years) it formed the concept of “I am/I am not” and tend to be driven by hopes and fears, just as our social structures and political/economic systems have been.  Hopes and fears are probably the 2<sup>nd</sup> strongest driving force in human existence after life and death, which makes sense if we consider that “I will” is an extension of “I am”, but with intention, as in, intending to achieve something or intending to avoid something.

We see these concepts at the very foundation of our ancestor’s attempts to describe their emerging concept of “The Creator”.

If we start with Western Judeo-Christian concepts, immediately we are challenged with the obfuscation of language.  This is best represented in the seminal message God gave to Moses at the Burning Bush.

> (3:13) “But,” said Moses to God, “if I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what do I tell them?” (3:14) God replied to Moses: “I AM WHO I AM”. Then he added: “This is what you will tell the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you’”. **~Exodus**

The most important detail about this line is that it can only be understood if read in Hebrew (Note: we don’t actually know what language the message was delivered in, not do we know if Moses even knew Hebrew.  All we know it our current sources were written in Hebrew 1000 years after Moses.  The claim that the message was delivered in Hebrew because God only spoke in Hebrew is suspect, but in any case, the languages of the day, Aramaic, Canaanite, Phoenician, are similar to Hebrew.) 

In Hebrew, the root word that means “to exist” or “to be” is HWH (*Ehyeh*, <img src='../Images/heb_HWH.png' style='height:10px'/>). Adding an A (<img src='../Images/heb_A.png' style='height:10px'/>) at the beginning makes it *1<sup>st</sup> person*, as in “I exist”.  Adding a T (<img src='../Images/heb_TAU.png' style='height:10px'/>) makes it *2<sup>nd</sup> person*, as in “you exist”, and adding a Y (<img src='../Images/heb_YOD.png' style='height:10px'/>) makes it *3<sup>rd</sup> person*, as in “he exists”.

Here, God tells Moses his name is “I AM WHO I AM” (*Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh*, <img src='../Images/iamthatiam.png' style='height:10px'/>), which can be interpreted as:

I will exist because I will exist
I exist because I exist
I am who I am
I will be who I will be
I am that which exists

It is not a matter of choosing which interpretation is correct.  Given that Hebrew only has tenses for *finished* (perfect) and *unfinished* (imperfect), and no *future* or *past* tenses, all these (and more) interpretations are simultaneously correct.

But, God also said “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”.  “I AM” here is spelled like YHWH (*Yih’weh*, <img src='../Images/yhvh.png' style='height:10px'/>, YHWH), which is the *3<sup>rd</sup> person* form of “to be” (HWH, *Ehyeh*, <img src='../Images/heb_HWH.png' style='height:10px'/>) .  This translates to “He exists” *and* “He will exist”.  It is unclear if the voice of *Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh* was speaking as the messenger for the even greater God of “He Is”, or, as pointed out by Jaynes, refers to itself in the *3<sup>rd</sup> person* because human consciousness at that time could only conceive of a god as someone/something outside of themselves.

In either case, we have instances of Awareness (I am, I exist) and instances of Intention (I will). This correlation fits so nicely that we could say that *finished* is a description of Awareness, in that awareness, in its pure form, is finished, perfect, in the present.  There is nothing for Awareness to “do” other that “to be”.  Intention is unfinished, a work-in-progress, the future, something that requires “work”.

<center><img src='../Images/ancient-yhvh_2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Why are we getting into this linguistic linguine?  One reason is to demonstrate how difficult it is to describe the simplest concepts that exist, that of “I Am” and “I Will”.  After thousands of years and thousands of volumes of opinion, doctrine, religious law, and in spite of the deliberate hiding, misspelling, encrypting, and misinterpreting the name of God (as it was forbidden to be spoken, and often forbidden to be written), there is still heated debate as to the “real” and/or “secret” significance of these words.  And if this subject wasn’t already shrouded in the mystical symbolism of Moses’ isolated vision, it has been orally passed on for centuries before it was translated from Phoenician to Hebrew to Greek to English and dozens of other languages, none of which hold the same significance as the language of Moses. For example, historians say that the Phoenician alphabet evolved out of symbols for things like fish (<img src='../Images/p_fish.png' style='height:10px'/>), eye (<img src='../Images/p_eye.png' style='height:10px'/>), tooth (<img src='../Images/p_tooth.png' style='height:10px'/>), weapon (<img src='../Images/p_weapon.png' style='height:10px'/>), etc., and even though the symbols and order are similar to Hebrew (and Greek), the legend is that Hebrew came from the words that were written with black fire on white fire in the presence of god, and that these words are the Torah as well as all the names of God, and so powerful with this language that, as the legend goes, the 1<sup>st</sup> letter of the Hebrew alphabet, ALEPH, was created by God opening his mouth to speak, but even that was so overwhelming it caused the people to fall to the ground (is this why the word “Aleph” is the joining of 2 words, “al”, meaning “god”, and “p”, meaning “mouth”? <img src='../Images/alephgodmouth.png' style='height:15px'/>). Obviously, the cultural significance of letters, words, and sentences will be dramatically different even between these similar languages.  

<img src='../Images/iamtri_rings.png' style='float:right;width:35%'/>The other reason is to show how tholonic concepts find form in not only scientific understanding, but religious and spiritual beliefs, and even language itself.  Any belief that advances dogma and confusion of any kind is a belief that is detrimental in understanding the nature of reality, but such beliefs have existed for thousands of years and appear to be very sustainable.  What follows is a simple description of the tholonic concept that is linguistically and conceptually compatible with many belief systems and which may shed light on their cryptic symbolism. 

## What? That!

You enter a restaurant and the waiter asks you “**What** would you like?”, and you reply “I’ll take **that**.” pointing to a plate of Rocky Mountain Oysters.  “What” is defining the context and is synonymous with “anything that” (with the implied “is on the menu”).  When “what” is used as a *predeterminer*, such as “What a great idea!”, it is still referring to the larger concept of “great idea” and is stating that the specific idea is worthy of being a member of the “great idea” category.  Any use of “what” will always refer to some context, either explicitly or implicitly; Bob: “I have money for the meter, so we can park here.”, Carol: “I have six toes.”,  Bob: “What!?”.

The word “that” is, grammatically, a *determiner* and a *relative pronoun* because it always refers to something specific that is contextually relative, and implies a plurality of potential “that’s”.  There’s no need for the waiter to ask what you want, or for you to say “I’ll have **that**”, if the only thing that they serve is Rocky Mountain Oysters.  

“I Am **That** I Am” is stating that the existence of “I Am” is, and only is, awareness of “I”, and that the entirely of that awareness is, and only is, the singularity of that awareness.  There is no context for that which is “I Am” other than “I Am”.  It is perfectly self-referential as “I Am” consists only of that singularity that is “I Am”.  On other hand, “I Am **What** I Am” means that the entirety of “I Am” is the sum of its parts, and even if those parts are instances of “I Am”, it is not a singularity because “what” explicitly refers to a plurality in contrast to the singularity of “that”. 

<img src='../Images/popeye.png' style='float:right;width:35%'/>Tholonically, “I Am **That** I Am” describes an instance or a concept from the perspective of a tholon as a whole, a *holon*.  “I Am **What** I Am” describes an instance or concept as a collection of parts, or *partons*, that make the whole. It is the difference between the creator and the created (e.g., God and *Popeye the Sailorman’s*, who’s fond of saying “I yam what I yam, and that's all what I yam”). And, as the parts are identical to the whole, we can say that the parts most definitely are made in the image of the whole.  

There is only a single instance where the the *holons* and *partons*, the context and contents, are identical, and that is the initial instance of the trigram.  This is the only true instance of “I Am **That** I Am”, and everything that follows is “I Am **What** I Am”.  The Aramaic name of God can be interpreted as either, as if we are being told that Jehovah is both the creator and the created, which is antithetical to the Abrahamic concept of a god.

<center><img src='../Images/trizirp.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

The thologram is not a religious or spiritual model, even though is seems to border on those areas.  However, it does apply to religious and spiritual models.  For example, we see a number of tholonic concepts in a number of creation stories, but, tholonically speaking, the biblical god could not be the Source A&I as it is clearly stated in Genesis 1:26  “*Then God said, 'Let Us make humans in Our image, according to Our likeness'*”, which tells us that the tholon from which creation sprang was a plurality of partons.  The tholonic view is that awareness and intention is inherent in all existence, suggesting that the god of the Bible was a tholonic intelligence establishing its sustainability, which is exactly what we would expect to see.

**Reinventing “I am” in the Age of Enlightenment**

Descartes had a similar understanding of this concept when he coined “Cognito, ergo sum” (*I think, therefore I am*)[^359].  Unfortunately, qualifying “I Am” with “I Think” could easily be perceived as intellectual hubris, or worse, self-defeating and dangerously ignorant.  While Descartes was a brilliant mathematician, scientist, philosopher and even metaphysician, we have to understand his world view in the context of 17<sup>th</sup> century Europe, before Newton, and even before the *Age of Enlightenment*, as many historian consider the *Age of Enlightenment* to have begun when Descartes originally coined this phrase with his publication of “*Discourse on Method*”.  The Western concepts of mind, consciousness, and thought were only beginning to hatch and they would quickly grow to be recognized as the defining quality that not only separated man from beast and made man a divine creature.  We can’t just blame intellectual arrogance that the intelligentsia of the day saw themselves closer to, and favored by, their all-powerful Christian sky-god, as this pitfall comes packaged with the ability to say “I” in the first place, but it no doubt played a role in their world view of those who ushered in the Age of Enlightenment.  The ability to have the concept of “I Am” was only possible for those that possessed  consciousness and rationality, as least in the way these concepts were defined later by Freud.  According to Freud, consciousness and rationality are not only ego-centric, they are the source of the ego.  

[^359]:The full quote is “Dubito, ergo sum, vel, quod idem est, cogito, ergo sum” (“I doubt, therefore I am, or what is the same, I think, therefore I am"), which was later shortened to “*Dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum* ("I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am"). 

Being the pioneer that Freud was, we should view his theories as “first drafts” of psychological theory, especially in light of the cultural revolution fueled by madness and modernity in 1900 Vienna.  The seeds of this revolution were being sewn 50 years earlier in Leipzig, Germany, when Gustav Fechner’s theories created what would later become *physiological science*, and in 1879, when William Wundt founded the first laboratory for psychological research, also in Leipzig, and which was succeeded by the empirical psychology of Ferdinand Ueberwasse.  It was this intellectual garden of the rigid, disciplined, demanding, competitive, imperialist German culture that was being strictly enforced the some-what tyrannical “Iron Chancellor”, Otto von Bismarck, that nourished the theories of Freud, Jung, Adler, Titchener, and the other midwives of modern psychology that quickly spread throughout the western world.  It was also this view of humanity that further developed the concept of *self* as “that which thinks” that was first introduced by Descartes (1644) in his “*Principles of Philosophy*” into the far more encompassing and modern concept of *self* as the “*totality of the individual, consisting of all characteristic attributes, conscious and unconscious, mental and physical*”[^447], a wholly materialistic concept that rejects all introspective ideas of imagery, memory, mind, consciousness, etc.  This concept of the self as a material, mechanical byproduct of “nature and nurture” (genetics and training) paved the way for behavioral psychology as a way to “predict and control animal behavior”, producing sociopathic luminaries such as B. F. Skinner, Ivan Pavlov, and the man credited as the founder of behaviorism, John B. Watson who, in addition to terrifying children to test his theories, proclaimed in his 1913 paper “*Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It*”[^448]:

> Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I'll guarantee to take anyone at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select—doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors.

John B. Watson went on to become the president of the American Psychological Association.

While behaviorism is still alive, well, and growing, the broader post-behaviorism ideas of Cognitive Behavioral therapy that formed in the 1950s and 1960s have also taken center stage.

[^447]: American Psychological Association, Dictionary of Psychology, https://dictionary.apa.org/self
[^448]: Watson JB. [Psychology as the behaviorist views it](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0074428). *Psychological Review.* 1913;20(2):158-177. doi:10.1037/h0074428

The tholonic view is that *self* is a construct that reflects where in the hierarchy of archetypes one’s awareness is anchored.  What is commonly called *self* is a particular instance of energy in a specific context.  This makes everything that exists a type of *self*, the only real difference being that the concept of *self* can only exist as an extension of “I am”.  The energy that launches rockets and the energy that moves your arms is the same, only in a different form and context.  Remove all context and there is only A&I.  Unlike the psycho-spiritual axiom that there exists a “true self” for each individual, the tholonic view is that there exists a number of embedded archetypes that an individual instance can “realize”.  A hyper-simplified example of embedded archetypes is something like:

- I am
- I am a living being
- I am a mammal
- I am a human
- I am an Asian human
- I am a female Asian human
- I am an old female Asian human
- I am a rich old female Asian woman
- I am a widowed rich old female Asian woman
- I am a widowed rich old female Asian woman living in New York City
- I am a widowed rich old female Asian woman living in NYC with gout

This list continues until we get to the “bottom”, which is a set of numerous archetypes or attributes from numerous branches of hierarchies that does not (yet) have any sub-archetypes.  DNA is a good example of an archetype in a biological hierarchy that has only a single instance.  Other hierarchies could be location (not necessarily limited to the 3 dimensions), cognitive changes (beliefs, ideas, knowledge, understanding), and so on.  Tholonically, for any instance there are many, many types of embedded archetypes, all of which interacting with others, creating new archetypes which also interact and create, ad infinitum.

Our erroneous concept of self has its roots in Judeo-Christian (which includes Islamic) thinking which goes back 6,000 years, so it is only natural that the great thinkers of the dominant Western culture over the last 400 years applied their genius within that context.  This is not meant to pick on Judeo-Christian concepts, as many other systems had similar concepts, but it was the Judeo-Christian model that dominated.  Obviously, the idea and model of *self* works, but it is ultimately unsustainable as it is dis-integrates the whole of which the individual *selfs* are a part of, thereby reducing the efficiency, stability, and balance of the whole.  Eventually, the “whole” (i.e., current form of humanity) will cease to exist, or the concept of the “self” will adapt and change, probably as a result of *evolutionary suicide*, i.e., catastrophic changes caused by the intelligence of the “whole” in an attempt to self-correct. 

With this historical context in mind, we can recognize that it is unreasonable to suggest that conscious and rational thinking is ego-centric, but it is not unreasonable to see how one must have the concept of “I” before they can say “I Think”, and, having such a concept, it would be natural for followers of a demanding, judging, and punishing god to consider themselves, their *self*, “special” and “better”.  While consciousness and rationality are not ego-centric, that does not mean that conscious, rational humans are not egotistical and self-serving any more than the benefits of fire does not mean it won’t do a lot of damage if uncontrolled.

It’s not surprising then, that for a devout 17<sup>th</sup> century Christian, which includes most, if not all, the great minds of Western modern culture, the concept of “I think” and “I Am” were essentially synonymous.  Thinking is what made man superior, and they had a divine right, and even a divine duty, to act superior, as that was commanded by their god:

> *Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth. **~Genesis 1:26**

For these people, that which did not have the concept of “I” was no more useful than however it was judged to be useful by man.  “I think therefore I am” is simply a contextually abridged version of “I am, therefore I am”, but it does raise the question: is  reason the modern day voice of the gods? Were the ancient voices of the gods an early instance of reason?  

While the thologram has no concept of a divine creator (beyond that of a 0-dimensional dot of A&I in an infinite nothingness), it does have a concept of a hierarchy of intelligences that have awareness and intention. From the tholonic view, the epiphanies of Moses and Descartes were due to the intentions of a greater intelligence to instantiate itself, but not simply *a* greater intelligence, but many greater intelligences that are constantly in a stage of negotiation via conflict and cooperation.

## Are Archetypes Alive?

If ideas are archetypes that have energy and fields, then it would be reasonable to think that an idea could be reinforced and strengthened by adding more energy to it.  How would one go about adding energy to an idea? If awareness is energy, then one obvious way would be to simply increase the awareness that an idea is exposed to.  This sort of thing is done all the time.  We can see it in politics, media, culture and traditions, even  National Prayer Day in the U.S. (May 7th) when the President signs a proclamation encouraging all Americans to pray on this day and “turn to God”.  Now, imagine the potential power of 114,000,000 consciousnesses all being exposed to the same symbolism at the same time, such as any of the bizarre Super Bowl half-time shows, or the 635,000,000 views of the Apollo 11 moon landing, or the London/Philadelphia Live Aid event with its 1.9 billions viewers, or the EU’s reality TV singing competition “Idols” that captured 3.2 billion viewers.  That is literally half the population of the planet!

Considering the average American youth spends 900 hours a year in school, and another 1,200 hours a year watching television, that 70% of the American adult waking life is spent in front of digital media, [^170] and that the average 78.6 year old American will spend 9 years of his life watching TV, 2 years of which is just watching commercials, we're talking about a tremendous amount of awareness, billions and billions of hours, up for grabs. How is that currently being used?  Considering the test results of the *Maharishi Effect* and its 4,000 participants, it’s hard to imagine the possibilities within reach as a global community.

Even if producers and broadcasters of media were oblivious to the power of collective awareness, which I suspect all but a few are, that much concentrated, coherent, focused awareness is naturally going energize all sorts of “fields”, similar to how the thermal hot springs brought life to bio-goo. In the tholonic model, intelligences will outright vie for that energy, especially the less sustainable and parasitic forms of intelligence as those tend to be far more energy greedy.

With the Internet and the decentralization of social media, we have seen a mad scramble for attention-mining and a dramatic polarization of ideologies, beliefs and agendas with equally desperate, dangerous, and even deadly attempts to control that attention.

We are seeing tremendous amounts of awareness, both conscious and unconscious being pumped into ideas, beliefs, symbols, memes, etc., many of which have existing archetypes, and therefore, according to the tholonic model, their own awareness, intention, and intelligence.

A suspicious person might begin to suspect that the manipulation of awareness as energy is perhaps already well understood by some less-than-noble folks. Others may think this is bordering on tin-foil-hat territory of mystical conspiracy theories.  The reader will come to their own conclusions. Our intention is to question the effects of such awareness harvesting, especially in light of the understanding that ideas have a life of their own. This includes ancient ideas, even if they seem to have been forgotten by modern society.

With that said, it must also be said that magic and mysticism also follows as strict a set of rules and reasoning as science, if more more strict, if you consider that some magic rituals can take many months, are physically challenging to point of being life-threatening, and leave no room for error, at least according to one of the more well-known grimoires[^428].  A major difference between science and mysticism is that science is based on observations and relationships to the external and physical reality, while mysticism depends on one’s observations and relationships with a non-physical reality.  This may sound like nonsense to some, but consider that near-death experiences (NDEs)[^434] are reported by about 17% of those who nearly die of which only 0.1% believed the experience was not real, [^429] and out-of-body experiences are reported by 10% of the population globally [^430].  These are very statistically significant numbers that are not easy to simply brush off.  An even more significant statistic is that out of the 7.87 billion people on the planet, 7.6 billion of of them (96%) believe in some sort of spiritual concept that, by definition, is not based in objective, physical reality.  

While it is true that the laws of reality are not subject to popular opinion, political and economic pressure, and self-interest, it is definitely the case that the practice of science is.  We can see an example of this in how 0.11% of the world’s population (the 8.8 million scientists[^431]) feel they have the intellectual authority to tell the other 7.87 billion people they share the planet with that they are deluded, gullible (official term “Barnum effect”[^432], i.e. “suckers”), or simply *wrong* in how they perceive their relationship with reality.  Unreasonable as it may be, it is not only common, but supported by the scientific community[^433] and research funding.

The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?). The authors of the study and the SA article conflate our neurological preference for either *time-preference* or *risk-preference* decision making (See: Frederick, Shane. 2005. “**Cognitive Reflection and Decision Making.**” *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, 19 (4): 25-42.DOI: 10.1257/089533005775196732, https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533005775196732), with the assumption that *time-preference* decision making is indicates lazy or weak thinking.  Even worse, they conclude with “Is there any way to protect people from falling prey to such magical thinking?”, which they then equate with “misinformation” and “conspiracy theories”.

It should also be pointed out that many breakthroughs in science had a mystical or paranormal ingredient.  We have seen how Newton was a dedicated alchemist and how  Kekulé’s vision of an ancient mystical symbol changed organic chemistry.  Einstein, though not overtly a follower of any religion, was deeply spiritual and a self-proclaimed disciple of Spinoza a (1632-1677), the 17<sup>th</sup> century Jewish philosopher and mystic.  Einstein even admitted that his Theory of Relativity was a result of his believing that here existed a “harmony of the universe”[^438] and &hellip;

> “behind all the discernible laws and connections, there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion.”  **~ Albert Einstein**

Furthermore, he believed that true science was to be a path of spiritual understanding:
>“Science can be created only by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion.”
>
>“Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe—a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the religiosity of someone more naïve.”
>
>“I assert that the cosmic religious experience is the strongest and noblest driving force behind scientific research&hellip; The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man’s image. In my view it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it.” 
>**~ Albert Einstein**

Carl Jung was not simply mystically inclined, he was a genuine mystic.  As a child, Jung’s life was filled with paranormal events, such as a wooden table spontaneously splitting apart and a kitchen knife in the cupboard loudly shattering into pieces.[^440]

These lived experiences are what led Jung into psychology,  and why his dissertation published in 1902 was titled “On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena”[^441].  His ideas would open an entirely new path to understanding the mind and consciousness.  

As an adult, Jung had visions and heard voices that made him think he migth be schizophrenic.  In two visions, each of which lasting hours and leaving his ill and weak, the message was the same:

> I saw yellow waves, swimming rubble and the death of thousands… two weeks passed then the visions returned, still more violent than before, and an inner voice spoke: “Look at it, it is completely real, and it will come to pass.  You cannot doubt this”. [^440]

I wasn’t until World War I broke out just months later and he saw all his visions come to pass that he realized it was not him that was insane.

Jung was also quite clear that the paranormal exists, and science is both at a loss to explain it, and has little interest as well, as he states in the forward he wrote for Aniela Jaffe’s “Apparitions and precognition” [^442]:

[^442]: Jaffe, Aniela, “**Geistererscheinungen und Vomidut**” (Zurich, 1958). Trans., New Hyde Park, New York, 1963

> One of the most notable things&hellip; is the fact that among the Swiss, who are commonly regarded as stolid, unimaginative, rationalistic and materialistic, there are just as many ghost stories and such like as, say, in England or Ireland. Indeed, as I know from my own experience and that of other investigators, magic as practiced in the Middle Ages and harking back to much remoter times has by no means died out, but still nourishes today as rampantly as it did centuries ago. One doesn't speak of these things, however, they simply happen, and the intellectuals know nothing of them-for intellectuals know neither themselves nor people as they really are. In the world of the latter, without their being conscious of it, the life of the centuries lives on, and things are continually happening that have accompanied human life from time immemorial: premonitions, foreknowledge, second sight, hauntings, ghosts, return of the dead, bewitching, sorcery, magic spells, etc. Naturally enough our scientific age wants to know whether such things are "true," without taking into account what the nature of any such proof would have to be and how it could be furnished. **~ Carl Jung, "Bilder und Symbole aus E.T.A. Hoffmanns Marchen 'Der goldne Topf”** 

In fact, the arenas of science and mysticism not only share a lot of territory, but at times their difference can me purely semantic.

We accept that the Sun is our planet’s source of energy, and we accept that it is extraterrestrial, but we don’t think of the Sun and a “extraterrestrial energy being”, like our ancient ancestors.  However, if we consider that there is a Sun intelligence, given that the Sun exhibits the properties of intelligence (as we defined it earlier, and certainly the Sun is as “intelligent” as some lab-grown hydrogel), we could say the Sun is an “extraterrestrial energy intelligence” and still be perfectly within the boundaries of scientific reasoning.

Science without mystery of the unknown, the metaphysical, the paranormal, without miracles and the unexplainable, cannot be the science that expands human understanding as it is lost in a dark cave of material scientism.

The tholonic view is that we have the ability to tap into these intelligences and archetypal, non-physical realities whenever we like or need, and often do unconsciously. This is the purpose and power of myths, be they ancient or modern, as well as totems, rituals, rites, superstitions, magic, Wicca, paganism, religion, animism, etc., and with the advent of global media, we will see a renaissance of these concepts emerge in the context of our modern culture.

As these archetypes exist in the uninstantiated tholonic state, they are free from the limitations of our space-time reality.  The myths and beliefs of the ancient past continue to live on in ever-evolving meaning and symbolism that promote their existence, almost like a self-mutating virus that has to constantly adapt to the context it exists in. 

Much of our everyday culture is inextricably bound to these archetypes.  Jung described these archetypes as *ordering factors* in the collective unconscious, such as his 12 archetypes of the human psyche organized into 4 cardinal types, which we described earlier, but there are *ordering factors* in every context of existence.

A cultural example might be how the *ordering factor* of *cooperation/conflict* instantiates as a social concept of “*Heinous deeds will be punished*”.  In the context of the Norse theology, this concept instantiated as the goddess named *Hel* whose job it was to not only judge the dead but also help the apocalypse along by Leading an army of the dead in a ship made of the fingernails of corpses.  This is where the modern word “hell” comes form, but was itself a literary translation (in the King James Bible) of the Hebrew word “Géenna”, which meant “valley of Hinnom”, which was where the waste of Jerusalem was dumped.  This same *ordering factor* appears in cultural concepts such as karma, judgment day, guilt, original sin, and many other forms.

The concept of *hell*, or whatever it happens to be called, is deeply ingrained into the worldview and collective conscious (and unconscious) of billions of people who have little knowledge of the roots of their beliefs. These believers, through the energy of their awareness, bring into creation associated and/or parasitic archetypes that are attached to primary archetypes which they are completely unaware of, but which are energized by that awareness nevertheless.  This suggests that the more awareness directed at the specific concept of *hell*, the more energize the attached concept of an apocalypse become, as they are 2 sides of one state, or rather, 2 tholonic archetypes that have a shared existence, at least within is instance of the concept of *hell*.

Language, as a way to convey concepts, is a microcosm of how archetypes merge, evolve, and reproduce.  An example would be how we can draw a very straight line of connection from the invention of hieroglyphics and moon worship to pharmaceutical drugs and those vacuum sealed plastic bags of imported Colombian coffee you buy at the supermarket, connecting along the way with magicians, pyramids, thieves and secret societies. 

The super-short version goes something like this: The Egyptian moon god, Thoth, who invented hieroglyphics, was adopted by the Greeks who called him Hermes, who was among other things, the protector of thieves. He carried the Caduceus, which became the symbol of modern medicine, and was the founder of the super-secret mystical teachings of Hermetism. So protected were these teachings that the word *hermetic* became synonymous with *perfectly sealed*, hence, *hermetically sealed* bags.  

<center><img src='../Images/hermes.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

What we have referred to as an uninstantiated tholon can, at least in this context, be an archetype as a form of *metameme*, which is a form of a *meme* that only exists in the collective unconscious and/or in the world of archetypes, the thologram. If a meme is “*an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture*”, then a metameme is an “an idea or belief formed within the tholonic field (i.e. universal mind,  collective unconscious, morphic field, etc.) and spreads from tholonic field to tholonic field”.   

You may have heard phrases like  “*If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, its probably a duck.*”, or “*When you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras.*”, or “*The simplest explanation is most likely the right one*”, otherwise known as *Occam’s Razor*. Applying the wisdom of this advice, what are we to make of the fact that research out of Princeton University supports the theory that ideas, in the form of social media networks, follow the same growth models as viruses (in the form of diseases)? [^171] 

Outside of the conclusion that perhaps Facebook and Twitter are actually viral diseases, it tells us that ideas follow the same patterns as existing natural patterns of growth, suggesting we might learn more about the life of archetypes if we considered them living.  OK, viruses *may* not be “alive”, but I say *may* because some experts in the field are redefining “life” to include viruses. [^172]<sup>,</sup>[^173] Regardless, the growth, survival, and creation of ideas follow the same patterns as everything else that grows, survives, and creates. For this reason, a clever researcher might be able to find correlations between the life cycle of a galaxy and something as seemingly unrelated as, say, the life cycle of a tomato plant. 

One such researcher might be Tokyo Institute of Technology’s Maruyama Shigenori, a Leading geophysicist and founder of the Center for Bio-Earth Planetology, who, by connecting the theories of astronomy with those of the life sciences, has shown how entire planets may well be living super-organisms.

This idea that archetypes are alive, however, has a dark side to it because so many of our beliefs are manipulated and controlled by others whose agenda is less than altruistic, hidden, and who are aware of the mechanics of reality and consciousness. From the most powerful laser in the world named after the Hindu god of destruction to trivial tarot cards based on movie stars, we can find countless examples of how these imposed archetypes infiltrate our understanding of the world.

So, what kind of world are we creating with our awareness, desires, and beliefs, as a planet? To find out, I wrote a mobile phone app that allows people to send out into the “ether” either a blessing or a curse.  The app was (unsurprisingly) called “Bless or Curse”.

The majority of both blesses and curses are about…wait for it…love, money, and health (surprise!). Some were touching, such as the blessing of “May he win lotto,” cast upon the bus driver who “stopped just for me”. Some are bizarrely dark, such as the curse of “Torture Rape Murder die die die die die,” cast upon Noisy Walgreen Employees. The predominant *cursers*, were Iran, Southern Australia, Puerto Rico, Russia/North Korean border, western South Africa, and Honolulu.  Predominant *blessers* were northwest Canada, southwest U.S., Eastern Europe, South pacific, Uruguay, Ghana/Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and the jungles of Northern Brazil.

Humanity seems to be pretty well split down the middle between the *blessers* and the *cursers*, as you can see by this report map below. In general, it tended to hover over the 53% area, giving the *blessers* a slight edge over the *cursers*.

### Tulpas

One of the better legends of how ideas can take on a life of their own comes from the well-known 1932 book, *Magic And Mystery In Tibet*, by Belgian-French explorer Alexandra David-Néel.

In the Far East, there is the concept of a *tulpa*, which is a type of thought-form. They are understood to be a sentient consciousness that resides in the brain of the host and can have separate feelings, thoughts, and memories from the host and can communicate through thought, imagination, feelings, or verbally. With enough practice and concentration, the host can see the tulpa’s form in the real world, and for the truly advanced *tulpamancer*, can be seen by others as well. Of course, this is a preposterous idea to Western thinkers. 

Alexandra David-Neel was a woman of remarkable courage. She recounts how the only way she could enter the forbidden (to foreigners) city of Lhasa, Tibet, was to sneak in dressed as a beggar carrying only a compass, money (for ransom in case she was kidnapped), and a gun. She was also known for her sound scientific thinking and her opinions and observation carried weight in academic and scientific circles. Doctor A. D’Arsonval, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, The Academy of Medicine, professor at the College of France and president of the Institute of General Psychology, said of Alexandra David-Néel:

> This well-known and courageous explorer of Tibet unites in herself all the physical, moral and intellectual qualities that could be desired of one who is to observe and examine a subject of this kind.[^174]

[^174]: Goodrich, Chauncey S., and Alexandra David-Néel. “**Magic and Mystery in Tibet.**” Journal of the American Oriental Society 93, no. 3 (1973): 415. doi:10.2307/599607.

So, when she described how she used the techniques taught to her by the Tibetan magicians to conjure up her own *tulpa*, it is not as easy to discard them as pure fantasy. In her case, she manifested a short, pudgy, jolly monk, as per her intentions.  Perhaps even more interesting was that this tulpa, once it began to be visible to others, began to have its own free will, a life of its own; the jolly, fat monk began to grow lean and taller, and less jolly. It eventually became a major problem for her, and she had to spend 6 months “dissolving” it. As she states:

> The fat, chubby-cheeked fellow grew leaner, his face assumed a vaguely mocking, sly, malignant look. He became more troublesome and bold. In brief, he escaped my control. I ought to have let the phenomenon follow its course, but the presence of that unwanted companion began to prove trying to my nerves; it turned into a ‘day-nightmare.’ Moreover, I was beginning to plan my journey to Lhasa and needed a quiet brain devoid of other preoccupations, so I decided to dissolve the phantom. I succeeded, but only after six months of hard struggle. My mind-creature was tenacious of life. There is nothing strange in the fact that I may have created my own hallucination. The interesting point is that in these cases of materialization, others see the thought-forms that have been created.

In Jewish folklore, there is a similar concept call a *golem* (not the *gollum* from “Lord of the Rings”, which is spelled differently).  These are beings created from clay or mud and then brought to life.  The most famous legend of a golem is the 16<sup>th</sup> century *Golem of Prague*.  This massive golem was specifically created to help protect the oppressed Jews, but, due to simple human error, the golem went berserk, destroyed the neighborhood, and was ultimately disabled and stored in the attic of a synagogue for hundred of years until that synagogue was bombed by the Nazis in WWII.  Some people believe it was not destroyed and is waiting to be brought back to life.

Whether tulpas and golems exist or not is left to the reader. The point is that the belief that ideas can take on a life of their own is neither new nor unique.

Perhaps we shall see our own modern versions of tulpas and golems soon, as that is where the research into what is essentially the collective consciousness of artificial intelligence, or *A.I. Swarms*, as they are called,[^175]<sup>,</sup>[^176] , and early attempts to create artificial humans[^177] appears to be heading.  No doubt, one day they too will prove to be “more troublesome and bold, escaping our control.”
