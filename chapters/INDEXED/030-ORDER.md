# 3: <u>ORDER</u>
###### On every scale of <u>existence</u>, <u>order</u> arises out of <u>chaos</u> and then returns to chaos.  Each <u>cycle</u> of <u>existence</u> can take millennia or nanoseconds.
##### **Synopsis:**  All that exists between 0 and &infin; is an expressions of energy. <u>Numbers</u> represent the distribution of that <u>energy</u> and describe <u>order</u>, and <u>order</u> is a function of perception and understanding.  <u>Order</u> has <u>scope</u> and <u>hierarchical</u> dependence, and each <u>scope</u> has its own <u>laws</u> and natural measure.  <u>Chaos</u> is the baseline state of <u>existence</u>, and the <u>order</u> that arises does so to more efficiently return to a state of chaos.  David <u>Bohm</u>’s *implicate/explicate* theory sheds light on the relationship between the appearance, or “relativity” of <u>order</u> and chaos.

Everything that exists must follow the <u>laws</u> of <u>existence</u>, for the penalty of not following those <u>laws</u> is non-existence.  This is why we call it the *<u>Laws</u> of <u>Physics</u>* and not the *Highly Recommended Suggestions of <u>Physics</u>*.  These <u>laws</u> of <u>physics</u> can change between one state or <u>scope</u> of matter and another, so before we look at some of the <u>laws</u>, let’s look at the scopes that these <u>laws</u> must function within, and some of the <u>concepts</u> we use to understand them.

## The Definition of <u>Numbers</u>

<u>Numbers</u> is the <u>language</u> of these <u>laws</u>, so let’s start there. One way to think about <u>numbers</u> in general is to imagine *value* as a <u>conceptual</u> form of <u>energy</u>, and a particular value, like 1 or 2, is an instance of that concept. This should not be too difficult as this is pretty much a description that even <u>Platonists</u> (*“<u>numbers</u> are non-physical, non-sensible things that exist in an objective realm beyond time and space”*) and <u>Nominalists</u> (*“<u>numbers</u> don’t exist outside of abstract man-made <u>concepts</u>”*) would agree on.  This is not a new idea, although it’s an idea that comes more from psychology and philosophy than mathematics[^385].  As <u>concepts</u> are energetic, they follow the <u>laws</u> of <u>energy</u> and have stable and unstable patterns.  The <u>concept</u> of *<u>numbers</u>* is one such stable <u>pattern</u> that emerged from the stable <u>patterns</u> in <u>nature</u> we can observe, and includes a <u>number</u> of sub-concepts, such as *real*, *rational*, *whole*, *natural*, *irrational*, and more, each with their own set of <u>laws</u> and definitions.  From the <u>tholonic</u> perspective, it does not matter if the <u>Platonist</u>’s or Nominalist’s theories are correct; all that matters is that the <u>concept</u> of *<u>number</u>* exists, and that these <u>concepts</u> represent instances of <u>energy</u>, because everything that exists, from things to <u>ideas</u>, are instances of energy.

[^385]: Marshall, Oliver R., “**Toward a Kripkean Concept of Number**” (2016). *CUNY Academic Works.* https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/703

We start with 0, *<u>nothingness</u>*, which, as explained earlier, also creates the <u>concept</u> of *<u>somethingness</u>*.  We can represent all instances of *<u>somethingness</u>* with the  non-numerical symbol of &infin; or *<u>unity</u>* of the system that contains all <u>somethingness</u> as 1.  This *<u>unity</u>* can be the *<u>unity</u>* of a bag fill of 12 oranges, or the *<u>unity</u>* of the Universe. This is the first <u>polarity</u>, 0 and 1, *<u>nothingness</u>* and *<u>unity</u> of all <u>somethingness</u>*.  

<u>Energy</u> always moves in one direction, the path of least <u>resistance</u>, the most efficient path, resulting in a more <u>balanced</u> state.  0 and 1 represent the most imbalanced state that can exist.  How will this become more <u>balanced</u>?  The next numerical <u>concept</u> after 1 is 2, because with the values [0,1] we can create the values [0,1,2] with the the 3 combinations of 0+0, 1+0, and 1+1. But how does 2 create a more <u>balanced</u> state between 0 and 1?

<img src="../Images/harmonic-shell.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>The only way 2 can balance the energy between 0 and 1 would be if 2 represented half of the value of 1, or 1&div;2, or $\frac{1}{2}$. Of course, there is still opportunity to create more balance with the next value that can be created with the 9 combinations of [0,1,2] that creates 5 unique values of [0,1,2,3,4].  Of this new set, the smallest possible value that is greater then the last value of 2 must be used, according to the laws of energy, and that value is 3.  Now we have $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$.  Again, with [0,1,2,3] we have 10 combinations that creates 7 unique values of [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,] of which the smallest new value is 4, giving us $\frac{1}{4}$.  This goes on forever, and what we end up with is a series of values called the *harmonic series*, $0,1,\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{5}\frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{7}\frac{1}{8}...$ (right image, left side).

The <u>harmonic</u> series is a fundamental <u>pattern</u> in <u>nature</u> and of music.  No doubt, this is the idea behind the Pythagorean <u>concept</u> that “Physical matter is music solidified”, or the <u>Sanskrit</u> *Nada Brahma*, “<u>Existence</u> is sound” (literally “god sound”) or the legends of Native Americans, Judeo-Christians, Hindu <u>cosmology</u>, Egyptian, Aboriginals, <u>Mayans</u>, Norse, and many other <u>cultures</u> that have a story of sound shattering the void of nothingness.  Imagine the progression of <u>numbers</u> as the <u>harmonic</u> series $\frac{1}{1}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{4}$ , rather than the typical progression of 1,2,3,4, (or what could also accurately be written as $\frac{1}{1}\frac{2}{1}\frac{3}{1}\frac{4}{1}$), is consistent with <u>concepts</u> of how <u>energy</u> is distributed and conserved and shows <u>numbers</u> as an *internal expansion* of <u>energy</u> that begins with the initial all-encompassing <u>concept</u> *<u>unity</u>*.  In our numbers-as-energy thought experiment, the <u>number</u> 1 represents the largest value and contains *within* it all numbers.  If there is a finite amount of <u>energy</u> in the <u>Universe</u>, then the entirety of that <u>energy</u> can be represented as 1 quantity, or 1 unit, of energy.  This would then imply that it is the *division* of that 1 unit of <u>energy</u> that accounts for creation, and that division, or at least one fundamental <u>pattern</u> of that division, will be the natural <u>harmonic</u> <u>patterns</u> of <u>energy</u> as shown in the <u>harmonic</u> series, the music of the <u>Universe</u>, literally and figuratively.  We find the <u>harmonic</u> series of $\frac{1}{1}$ &rightarrow; $\frac{1}{\infty}$ in the <u>energy</u> <u>patterns</u> of <u>nature</u> and the <u>Universe</u> because <u>numbers</u> *do* represent energy.

#### **Key 10:** <u>Numbers</u> represent <u>energy</u> and the <u>number</u> sequence represents the <u>balancing</u> of <u>energy</u> and the creation of all things.

We don’t count in fractions, we count in whole <u>numbers</u>, but the difference between whole <u>numbers</u> and fractions is how we compare *<u>unity</u>* with the *parts of <u>unity</u>*; $\frac{whole}{part}$ vs $\frac{part}{whole}$.  If we want to know how much of the *whole* does a *part* account for, the we divide the *whole* by the *part*, but if we want to know much of the *part* does the *whole* account for, then we divide the *part* by the *whole*.  As we <u>humans</u>, and all things, are *parts* of the *whole* of the <u>Universe</u>, we can only consider the *parts*, as we have no <u>concept</u> of *the* whole other than it is a *whole*, a *<u>unity</u>*, 1 *<u>existence</u>*, that all things have in common,  so $\frac{2}{1}\frac{3}{1}\frac{4}{1}$ becomes 2,3,4.

#### **Key 11:** From a Universal perspective, <u>numbers</u> only get smaller.  From an individual perspective, <u>numbers</u> only get larger.

## The Definition of <u>Order</u>

*<u>Order</u>* refers to the arrangement of things.  Those things can be objects, <u>patterns</u>, sequences, <u>ideas</u>, methods, or anything that can be defined.  We typically think of *<u>order</u>* as some type of <u>structured</u>, organized, <u>pattern</u>, but these are types of *<u>order</u>* of which there are many, such as <u>random</u>, chaotic, linear, to name just a few.  If we consider <u>chaos</u> to be a spectrum from 0 to &infin;, they we can also consider *<u>order</u>* to be the inverse spectrum of &infin; to 0.  This would be similar to how we measure light or heat. We don’t measure the cold by how much cold there is, but by how much heat there is because cold and dark represents a lack of <u>energy</u>, and we can only measure the lack of something by how much of that something exists.  If something has no <u>energy</u>, it simply does not exist.  No <u>energy</u> is total nothingness.  It is the same for <u>order</u>, but where <u>energy</u> exists as different types, such as light and heat, <u>order</u> exists as different types, such as <u>random</u> or linear.  The lack of <u>order</u> is not *<u>nothingness</u>*, as there is still <u>energy</u>, but it is chaos. In this way, chaos/order is an instance of the <u>archetype</u> of nothingness/somethingness. The comparison of <u>energy</u> to <u>order</u> is not just metaphorical, as *<u>order</u>* requires <u>energy</u>, or more accurately, <u>energy</u> produces *<u>order</u>*.  

Does that mean everything has *<u>order</u>*?  To some degree, yes, because for something to have 0 *<u>order</u>* it would also have to have 0 <u>energy</u>, and if there was 0 <u>energy</u>, it would not exist.  We that say then that anything that exists, exists somewhere on the spectrum of *chaos/order*.  The challenge is determining the type and degree of *chaos/order*, and towards that end we have discovered and invented many types of <u>chaos</u> and <u>order</u>, with many more to come.

#### **Key 12:** Everything that exists has <u>energy</u>, therefore, has some type of order.

#### **Key 13:** <u>Order</u> is a measure of energy.

We use the term “<u>order</u>” quite liberally, even to describe things that have no obvious or even provable <u>order</u>, such as in “chaotic <u>order</u>” or “<u>random</u> <u>order</u>”.  If everything has *<u>order</u>*, then the word becomes meaningless.  Traditionally, “<u>order</u>” refers to a discernible <u>pattern</u>, while the more post-modern view of “<u>order</u>” refers to “the way things are”, synonymous with “arrangement”, ordered or not.  

So what do we really mean when we say something is *ordered*?  The <u>tholonic</u> view of *<u>order</u>*, in practical terms, refers to how predictable something is, and this <u>predictability</u> is the result of our level of <u>understanding</u> of that thing.  This makes *<u>order</u>* more of a perception than a description.    Guppies[^391], honeybees[^382], hyenas[^383], <u>dogs</u>[^384], and numerous other animals have some abilities to recognize *<u>order</u>*.  A 10-month old baby can recognize *<u>order</u>* among 3 items, and crow’s abilities to recognize the *<u>order</u>* of process is equal to that of a 7-year-old human, but none of them could solve a Rubik's Cube because their <u>understanding</u> of *<u>order</u>* is limited.  *<u>Order</u>*, then, is also a measure of understanding.

#### **Key 14:** <u>Order</u> is a measure of <u>understanding</u> and exists to the degree that it is perceivable, definable, and predictable.

<u>Chaos</u> precedes <u>order</u> just as our *lack* of perception and <u>understanding</u> precedes our perception and understanding.  This would be pretty difficult to argue with, which is why we can say:

#### **Key 15:** <u>Chaos</u> precedes order.

This is not to say that <u>chaos</u> and <u>order</u> are only defined by the limits of our perception, but that our definitions of them are.   Nor is this a claim that there is no such thing as <u>chaos</u>, only <u>order</u> yet to be perceived, but we do claim that, as <u>chaos</u> precedes <u>order</u>, it is <u>chaos</u> that is the baseline of <u>reality</u> and creation as it is the most <u>energy</u> efficient, most <u>sustainable</u> state, and that <u>order</u> must be one state or condition of <u>chaos</u> as <u>order</u> is less <u>sustainable</u> than chaos.  <u>Order</u> is, with respect to <u>chaos</u>, a temporary state.  

When we are talking about systems with systems, which is how our <u>reality</u> is put together, we are also talking about the <u>chaos</u> and <u>order</u> within each of these systems.  The <u>scope</u> of a system is defined not simply by the <u>order</u> of a system, but by where that <u>order</u> breaks down within the system,  Newton’s <u>Laws</u> of Motion <u>work</u> fine until things get too big, small, hot, cold, or fast, at which point those <u>laws</u> begin to falter because the <u>order</u> of <u>reality</u> begins to change in those zones that lay at the outskirts of the <u>order</u> of <u>reality</u> we exist in.

For example, if we being 1 mile tall we can see perfectly ordered patches and circles of corn crops.  As we shrunk, that <u>order</u> would be less and less visible, but we would begin to see the <u>order</u> of rows of corn stalks.  As we continues to shrink, we would loose sight of the corn crops, but begin to see the <u>order</u> of the plant, then the <u>cells</u>, then the <u>molecules</u>, then the <u>atom</u>, then the <u>quarks</u>, then the preons, then &hellip; nothing, I suppose, as preons are the 0-dimensional <u>conceptual</u> points that create quarks.  The same applies to what we would see if we grew larger and larger, passing through solar system, the galaxy, the <u>multiverse</u>, and finally… the 0-dimensional <u>conceptual</u> points that creates universes.

Another example might be how we destroy the <u>order</u> of a tree to create the <u>order</u> of lumber.  All that was exclusively the part of the <u>order</u> of the tree comes to an end, and the <u>order</u> that is created exclusively by the lumber, such as a chair, comes into being.  These are 2 scopes of <u>order</u> that do not overlap, but they are both children an <u>order</u> that remains in both tree and lumber, such as the <u>structure</u> of wood (cellulose, homocelluloses, and lignin).  This tells us that the <u>order</u> of lumber and trees are subsets or, or dependent upon, or within, the <u>structure</u> of wood.  When that wood is burnt, its <u>order</u> and the <u>order</u> of anything that is within its <u>order</u>, such as a desk or tree, disappears via pyrolysis, or thermal degradation, and the hydrocarbons are broken down to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and carbon (ash), each of which abiding by the <u>order</u> within the <u>scope</u> it now exists.

You can easily imagine the never ending series of *<u>chaos</u> $\rightarrow$ <u>order</u> $\rightarrow$ <u>chaos</u> $\rightarrow$ <u>order</u> $\rightarrow$ <u>chaos</u> $\rightarrow$ <u>order</u>* &hellip…  

For this <u>reason</u> we also claim:

#### **Key 16:** <u>Order</u> precedes chaos.

Truly <u>random</u> events may be the exception, as a truly <u>random</u> event doesn’t follow any rule, <u>pattern</u>, or reason. By this definition, it’s likely that nothing in <u>nature</u> is truly <u>random</u>, but it's probably safe to say that there are *apparent* <u>random</u> events that *do* follow currently unknown rules, <u>pattern</u>, and reason.  This makes it impossible to prove anything is <u>random</u>, and that's even if we ignore Gödel’s *incompleteness theorem* which proves that it is impossible to prove any absolute <u>truth</u>, only truths based on unprovable assumptions.  For this <u>reason</u>, we’ll be avoiding the <u>concept</u> of <u>randomness</u> for the most part in this book, but we can say that:

#### **Key 17:** <u>Randomness</u> can create <u>chaos</u>, but <u>chaos</u> cannot create randomness.

## The <u>Scope</u> of <u>Order</u>

Some <u>laws</u> are *universal*, and some are *local*.  However, what we are calling *universal* may well be *local*, but in a much larger context that we cannot see beyond.

An example of a *local* <u>law</u> might be the *Standard Model* of particle <u>physics</u> that describes the relationship between 3 of the 4 fundamental forces and the elementary particles that make up the matter in our universe.  This is a set of <u>laws</u> and constants that apply to particle physics.  You don’t see this model replicated in larger systems because the model only makes sense when dealing with the <u>reality</u> of sub-atomic particles.  Likewise, Oort constants only apply to the rotational properties of the Milky Way.

<u>Science</u> calls the <u>scope</u> of our everyday Newtonian <u>reality</u> *Macrorealism*[^8] or *Local Realism*, and the subatomic <u>scope</u> is called *<u>Quantum Mechanics</u>*.  <u>Understanding</u> how different <u>laws</u> operate in different scopes is an area of intense research and has led to such landmark experiments like:

- **Bell’s inequalities**: The <u>math</u> that enables the distinction between two different views of <u>reality</u>, typically the relativistic view vs. the quantum view.
- **Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox**: The speculation that every particle in the <u>universe</u> knows the state of every other particle in the <u>universe</u> at all time, and that no two particles in the <u>universe</u> have the same state.
- **<u>Leggett-Garg inequality</u>**: The claim that in the quantum world something can be in two states at the same time, which is impossible for the macroscopic world.

...  to name a few.

#### **Key 18:** Local <u>laws</u> and constants are valid only within the context of their scope.

An example of universal <u>laws</u> or <u>patterns</u> that span many scopes might be the Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377&hellip;) and its constant ratio of Phi (φ), also called the *Golden Ratio* (1:1.618).  This <u>number</u> is the ratio that not only pops up in galaxies and sea-shells but, according to some <u>evolutionary</u> and chemical scientists[^9], is the ratio that keeps all of <u>existence</u> in <u>order</u> and is the shape of <u>space-time</u> itself.

<center><img src='../Images/003-phi-shell.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Another universal <u>law</u> might be simple <u>fractal</u> <u>math</u> formulas that have a form like *f(x)= x<sup>2</sup>-1*, which can be found across all forms of <u>existence</u>[^10], suggesting that self-similarity is a universal property.  *Power <u>laws</u>* explain how a relative change in one measurement can result in a proportional relative change in another measurement (e.g.  logarithmic or exponential), and we see these across all levels of <u>existence</u> as well.  These universal <u>laws</u> can be found in astronomy, <u>physics</u>, <u>biology</u>, meteorology, <u>cosmology</u>, mathematics, <u>economics</u>, and many other areas including <u>society</u>, wealth and <u>work</u> distribution, <u>competition</u>, media exposure, and much more.

Another universal <u>law</u> might be Benford’s <u>Law</u>, which is the <u>pattern</u> that describes the chances of what will be the first digit of a <u>number</u> that naturally appears, such as lengths of rivers, populations, <u>numbers</u> printed on the first page of a newspaper.  This might sound odd, as simple logic would suggest that the chances of, say, the <u>number</u> 1 being the first digit in a series of <u>numbers</u> would be 1 in 9, but that is not the case.  About 150 years ago it was discovered that the <u>number</u> 1 is the first digit 30% of the time, while the <u>number</u> 9 only about 5%!  In the two images below we can see this <u>law</u> in action when we plot the populations of every county in the U.S. and then count the first digit of each of those populations.

<center><img src='../Images/bensonslaw2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>



The <u>reason</u> for this is because, while we may count in a linear fashion, 1,2,3,4… etc., <u>nature</u> distributes itself in a logarithmic fashion.   For example, let’s say we have three naturally occurring scales; 0 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000.  With each new scale we simply add a 0.  There are 10 <u>numbers</u> in the 1<sup>st</sup> scale, 90 in the 2<sup>nd</sup> scale, and 900 in the 3<sup>rd</sup> scale, but as far as <u>nature</u> is concerned, each scale has an infinite <u>number</u> of divisions, so they are effectively the same from <u>nature</u>’s perspective.  This is how we discovered (or why we invented) logarithms; to replicate the *natural* way <u>numbers</u> <u>work</u> (and why we call it *natural logarithms*).  The image below shows these 2 scales.

<center><img src='../Images/scalar.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Logarithms allow us to multiply simply by adding.  For example, the log of 10 = 1, and the log of 100 = 2, so instead of multiplying 10&times;100 to get 1000, we can just add 1+2.  This gives us 3, and because we are using the normal base 10 system, we convert these log values back to normal values with 10<sup>3</sup>, which is 1000. 

Once upon a time, before the invention of digital calculators, and after its invention in 1859 by a French artillery officer, every engineer had a *slide rule*, which allowed them to do this multiplication-by-adding (and more) simply by sliding some rulers back and forth.

<center><img src='../Images/sliderule.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

How does this apply to 30% of all our <u>numbers</u> beginning with a 1?  Because the occurrence of any <u>number</u> as the 1<sup>st</sup> digit is the log of the next <u>number</u> minus the log of the number.  So, the chances that the value of 1 will be the first value in <u>random</u> list of <u>numbers</u> is *log(2)-log(1)=0.30*, or 30%/  For the value of 9, the chances are *log(10)-log(9)=0.045*, or 4.5%.  

The point here is not to get into <u>math</u>, but to show that <u>nature</u>’s <u>concept</u> of scale, or <u>scope</u>, is *invariant*, meaning, <u>nature</u> treats all the scopes or scales, the same, so we would expect to find <u>laws</u> in one scale equally applied to all scales.

## Appearance of <u>Order</u>

<img src='../Images/CMB.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>A good visual example of how these laws (in this case, oscillation and entropy, which is discussed at length in the next chapter), affect our perception and understanding of chaos and order is in the distribution of the  energy that fills every corner of the Universe.  This is known as *cosmic microwave background radiation*  (CMBR).  The left image (of right chart) shows the CMBR filling the known Universe with ~2.64 K of heat (-269.51 C&deg;, about 4&deg; C above absolute 0).  The energy is widely dispersed, has no pattern, and is a perfect example of chaos.  It may actually be perfect chaos, which is why some scientists are proposing to use CMBR as a natural source of random numbers[^386] (as true random numbers are extremely difficult to generate).  But, to see this natural chaos, a major correction had to be applied to adjust for *red-shifted* and *blue-shifted* effects due to our galaxy hurling through the Universe at about 1,497,600 miles per hour which make anything we are heading toward look *blue-er*, and everything we are heading away from look *red-er* (due to the compression and expansion of the wavelengths of light).  The way we *actually* see this omnipresent chaos is shown in the right image. The only factor that accounts for the difference between the appearance of chaos and order is the movement of our galaxy.  It is through this movement that chaos *appears* as order. 

Can we say that if something *appears* to have <u>order</u> then is *has* <u>order</u>?  In this case, the <u>chaos</u> remains <u>chaos</u>, and the apparent <u>order</u> is the result of the <u>laws</u> of interaction of energy. We can say that about anything, as where there is no <u>movement</u>, there is no <u>energy</u>, and where there is no <u>energy</u>, there is the *<u>chaos</u> of <u>nothingness</u>*.  

#### **Key 19:** <u>Movement</u> creates order.

The CMBR is considered the smoking-gun evidence of the <u>Big Bang</u>[^11], which is the scientific explanation of when the *<u>chaos</u> of <u>somethingness</u>* met the *<u>chaos</u> of <u>nothingness</u>*.

#### **Key 20:** <u>Movement</u> creates chaos.

## <u>Order</u> of <u>laws</u>

Even though there are many, many classes of <u>laws</u>, for this writing we are only going to use these two general scopes of <u>laws</u>, the *local* and the *universal*, because no matter what <u>laws</u> may exist, they will fall into one of these two scopes (or children of these scopes).

Local <u>laws</u> may be local, but they can affect everything that is built upon them.  Everything is made of <u>atoms</u>, and <u>atoms</u> are the size they are because of *Planck’s constant*, which is the relationship between the <u>mass</u> and the <u>frequency</u> of the particles that make up an atom.  If that constant were to change, the entire <u>universe</u> would be radically different, if it even existed at all.  If Planck’s constant was to increase by only 2.5%, the size of <u>Earth</u>, it's spin, <u>gravity</u>, and the density of the atmosphere would all increase.  If it was 2.5% less, <u>Earth</u> would shrink by 20%, its rotation would increase, <u>gravity</u> would lesson, and much of the atmosphere would disappear.  If Planck's constant changed from 6.2618&times;10<sup>-34</sup> to 6.2618&times;10<sup>-20</sup>, the radius of an <u>atom</u> would go from being microscopically small to being 100 times the distance to the nearest star!

On a more realistic level, consider a bridge made of bricks.  If the <u>laws</u> that bind <u>molecules</u> together change such that they have a lesser negative charge, then the bridge would melt on a warm day.  The (relatively) *universal* Newtonian <u>laws</u> did not change, only the *local* <u>laws</u> changed on the particle level.  

It’s logical that the <u>laws</u> of particle <u>physics</u> affect everything that exists because everything is made of particles, but that does not make the <u>laws</u> of particle <u>physics</u> *universal* in <u>scope</u>, rather, that which is made of particles is *dependent* on the <u>laws</u> that operate in the *local* particle <u>scope</u>, thereby making the effects of local <u>laws</u> farther reaching than their domain.

#### **Key 21:** Local <u>laws</u> can alter everything that descends from, or depends on them.

## The State of <u>Order</u>

It is these <u>laws</u> that create <u>order</u> out of <u>chaos</u> and <u>chaos</u> out of order.  That <u>order</u> exists between the two states of zero-energy <u>chaos</u> and total-energy <u>chaos</u>, but even within the <u>chaos</u> we can find clues of <u>order</u> as neither a *<u>zero</u>* or *total* state of <u>chaos</u> is possible in the material domain, just *closest-to-zero* and *closest-to-total* states.

One theory that sheds light on new thinking about <u>chaos</u> and <u>order</u> is David <u>Bohm</u>’s *<u>Implicate</u> <u>Explicate</u> theory*.  In short, <u>Bohm</u> describes this theory by stating:

> In the enfolded (or <u>implicate</u>) <u>order</u> space and time are no longer the dominant factors determining the relationships of dependence or independence of different elements.  Rather, an entirely different sort of basic connection of elements is possible, from which our ordinary notions of space and time, along with those of separately existent material particles, are abstracted as forms derived from the deeper order.  These ordinary notions, in fact, appear in what is called the “<u>explicate</u>” or “unfolded” <u>order</u>, which is a special and distinguished form contained within the general totality of all the <u>implicate</u> orders.  **\~Bohm, “Wholeness and the <u>Implicate</u> <u>Order</u>”**

To demonstrate this <u>concept</u>, we can use an ink droplet analogy.  In this demonstration, we place three drops of ink into a cylinder of glycerin.  The cylinders are then turned, which mixes the ink droplets together.  Reversing the spin of the cylinders then reconstructs the ink drops.  When the ink droplets are in their original form, at the beginning and the end of the spinning, they are *explicitly* ink droplets and have the *<u>order</u>* of ink drops.  When they are mixed up together, they are *implicitly* ink droplets only, and their <u>order</u> would be considered more *chaotic*.  The <u>order</u> of the ink drops has been destroyed, but the <u>information</u> of that <u>order</u> exists as a *virtual* ink-drop, an <u>archetype</u> only, within the <u>chaos</u> of their mixed state.[^12]

In practical terms, this theory says that when something exists in the physical world it is in an *explicit*, or *unfolded* state.  To exist in this state, it must conform to a set of rules that define the archetype(s) of the form it will take.  When it does not conform to these rules, it still exists, but only in an *implicit* or *enfolded* state, a state we cannot see or interact with (under normal circumstances).  This sounds similar to the “sea” of <u>potential</u> or unmanifest <u>wave</u> functions that collapse into form.  This state has its own rules as well but they are a super-set of the *explicit* rules, making a *thing*, or physical <u>reality</u> as we know it, just one sub-state of a *thing*, or <u>reality</u>, it can be in.

It is these local and universal <u>laws</u> that cause form to *unfold,* to *<u>explicate</u>* itself, <u>self-organize</u>, form <u>patterns</u> and move in accordance with these laws.  By the same token, these <u>laws</u> will also *enfold* or *<u>implicate</u>* these forms, causing them to return to an unrecognizable state, but even in that unrecognizable state they are <u>contributing</u> to, or affecting, other yet-to-coalesce <u>implicate</u> patterns.  Depending on the form and the medium, and under certain conditions, one can imagine see how the past (that which is enfolding) and the future (that which is unfolding) can effect each other, and in both directions.

Here is another example that perhaps better displays the idea.  Below are four pages that started out as identical.  To each page was added some <u>random</u> dots, but *within* a narrow region of a circular line, however, none of those dots stood out from the page’s original <u>random</u> dots and were in no way identifiable as *special* dots. As we merge the pages, the <u>randomness</u> gets denser and denser until a all four pages are perfectly aligned and those extra <u>random</u> dots can easily be seen as a circular line.

The circle is *implicit* in the <u>random</u> dots of each separate page, and *explicit* when the pages line up together in the proper manner.  In this example, the *local* <u>pattern</u> would be the <u>random</u> <u>pattern</u> on each page, which represents the <u>scope</u>, and the *universal* <u>pattern</u> would be the parts of the circle as it exists on every page.

All of this addresses the relationship between instantiation and context, in that, how something comes into <u>existence</u> and how it is expressed is dependent on the context and <u>scope</u> of where it is being expressed.  This <u>concept</u> is not only a technical or scientific one, but also a philosophical one that we can see in <u>Buddhism</u> as the principle of *Pratītyasamutpāda*, which means *dependent arising*, and which states that all phenomena (*dharma*) arise in dependence upon other phenomena (*dharmas*).  More than that, it also implies that the significance of something is defined by its environment.  An obvious example of this is how the same wooden ball falls in the air, is motionless on the ground, and rises in the water.

Now we can continue on the subject of energy.
