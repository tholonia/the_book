# 10: MIND

###### The universal machine of creation
##### **Synopsis:** “Mind” in general refers to the processes in the application of intelligence that is inherent in the Awareness and Intentions of existence that exists on a spectrum of coherence.  Consciousness is an instance of Awareness.  An individual “mind” is an instance of Intention.  The processes of “Mind” creates self-similar patterns and is, therefore, a product of energy specifically for the purpose of creating balance which arises out of cooperation and conflict that results from Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution

##### **Keywords:** coherence, incoherence, consciousness, intelligence, aggregates, cooperation, adaptation, conflict

## Coherence

We’re going to introduce a new concept here; coherence.  Most readers will already have an idea of what that means, but like so many words, it can mean different things in different contexts, so let’s be clear on how it will be used here.  

“Coherent” can mean *logically connected*, *consistent*, a *natural connection between parts*, and generally convey the idea of parts that contribute to the whole, i.e., *partons*.  This is a fundamental concept of the thologram, with its tholons and partons.  In physics, coherent has a very specific, measurable definition.

<img src='../Images/incoherent.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>*Incoherent* light is light of every possible wavelength (given the context of the source, such as the Sun or a bulb) that travels in every direction is *can* travel.  This is the common form of light we see and use every day.  Incoherence is the most fundamental quality of energy, as energy’s nature is to expand in every way and in every direction it can.  Using the word *incoherent* to describe the creative and expansive nature or energy is unfortunate as incoherence is synonymous with senseless, disorganized, and meaningless, which could not be further from the truth when it comes to the most efficient distribution of energy in the universe.

<img src='../Images/coherent.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>*Coherent* light is when all the waves are of the same wavelength, oscillating in harmony, and all moving in the same direction.  Like most things in our space-time reality, there are 2 kinds of coherence; time and space. *Spacial coherence* is when light of any wavelength is traveling in the same direction.  *Temporal coherence* is when all the light is only one wavelength but can be traveling in any direction.  The Sun emits plenty of coherent light, as proven by the famous Michelson–Morley experiment in 1887, as do the stars.  In practical terms, there can’t actually be a single wavelength of light because wavelength, as a measure, is analog.  We can say the wavelength is 555 nm (nanometers), but that still leaves an infinite number of possible wavelengths between 555.0 nm and 555.99999999 nm, nor can two photons travel the exact same path, so there is no such thing as perfect coherence, only perfect incoherence.  Still, the most coherent beam sent out of from our best lasers is 4 miles wide by the time it hits the moon, but that is only 0.0000000006% of the 641,839,945,499 square miles that is covered by the same incoherent light.  According to theory, the least divergence we can ever expect to see is 0.000038&deg;.

How is light made more coherent?  In the case of a laser, there is a mirror at each end of a gas-filled tube.  The gas is zapped with energy, exciting the atoms and causing them to emit photons.  Due to the properties of the gas, these photons are of a specific wavelength only.  This is the temporal coherence part of a laser.   These photons do what photons naturally do and travel to where they *can* travel,  which is pretty limited given they are stuck in a tube.  Some of the photons are lucky enough to hit the mirror, bouncing them to the other mirror, which then causes the photons to bounce back and forth forever between them.  As these photons bounce back and forth, they also stimulate other atoms to emit photons that travel in the same direction.  This is called the *avalanche effect*, and, as the name implies, soon, all the photons are bouncing back and forth along 1 dimension in both directions, which creates spatial coherence.    It is the interference created by these opposing directions that causes a *standing wave pattern* to form, just like the interference in sounds waves across a 2D surface causes some part of the surface to stay still (where the sand ends up) and other parts to vibrate a lot (where the sand bounces off).  Think of the photons as grains of sand, the energy pumped into the tube as vibrations of sound, and the pattern created in the tube as the result of the speed of light and the distance between the two mirrors.  One of the mirrors is only 98% reflective, and one is 100%, so the light that comes out of the laser is the 2% that is allowed to escape.

In short, the way to make energy more coherent is to create a sustainable pattern that conserves energy, and soon all the energy will be traveling that path of least resistance.  The reality we know, with planets, atoms, and laws, is such a multidimensional standing wave pattern.  Primal A&I is instantiated as the expansion of incoherent energy.  Our material Universe is the result of the patterns caused by the various resonances, or “coherences”, of various forms and frequencies of that energy.   If *frequency* = $\frac{speed-of-light}{wavelength}$  and *reality-as-we-know-it* = $\frac{energy}{space-time}$, both of which are provably true, can we also say *instantiations* = $\frac{A\&I}{context}$, and if so, how can we test that?

## Consciousness

Suppose the concept of a thing and the thing itself are two orders of the same form of expression of energy, and order is a prerequisite to intelligence.  Does this imply that everything with order potentially has a form of intelligence?  In the tholonic model, yes, but more than that, even without the coherence of order or intelligence, there is the incoherence of A&I.   

*Note: More accurately, what we are calling “intelligence” should be called “coherent intelligence” or “low-entropy intelligence”, as intelligence is innate to existence, which includes the chaos that order emerges from and returns to.  We can think of that chaotic incoherent intelligence as “high-entropy intelligence”, but for simplicity and clarity, when we refer to “intelligence,” we are referring to coherent, low-entropy intelligence.*

#### **Key 67:** Consciousness is a coherent form of A&I.

The fact that we tend to understand consciousness through our human perspective prevents us from seeing it as an attribute of existence.  Humans may ask, “When did consciousness arise?” but from the tholonic perspective, consciousness is a limited instance of an unlimited A&I.  As all matter and form of energy and energy *is* A&I, as explained earlier, then all limited instances of energy must be a form of consciousness.  The main difference is that A&I is incoherent and consciousness has some coherence.  That makes the smallest form of matter “conscious” to some degree, as is it coherent enough to be sustainable.

This definition requires we see consciousness radically different from our current perspective.  The tholonic view is that consciousness, like order, and even life, was/is created by the movement of energy to attain balance.  The fact that our relatively advanced level of consciousness allows us to say “I Am” is not surprising if we consider that source A&I is essentially an incoherent version (i.e., radiating in all frequencies in all directions) of the same concept.  There is no reason to presume that the 0-dimensional dot expressed an awareness of “I Am” as the concept of “I” existed because the concept of “I” implies the concept of “Not I”, which could not have existed in nothingness, for to say “That which is not I is nothing” is to say “That which is I is everything”.  However, it’s existence does establish the unlimited version of the concept as “IS”, or perhaps “That Which Is”, for lack of a better word in English.  In Sanskrit, the word is *Sanmātra* (<img src='../Images/sanmatra.png' style='height:15px'>),  meaning “*Mere existence*”, “*That from which only existence is predictable*”.

Being the only awareness in a nothingness void of space, time, or dimension, a sole 0D dot is, by definition, limitless, so it can only be incoherent when instantiated in space-time.  Incoherent energy contains an infinite number of wavelengths and frequencies expanding in an infinite number of directions, which means that it must consist of an infinite number of “coherences”, each traveling in their own direction.  Hence, if consciousness is a coherent form of A&I, there is an infinite number of potential consciousnesses, one for every thing that can ever, has ever, or does exist.

#### **Key 68:** Matter and consciousness is an instance of A&I in a limited context.

Understanding the difference between consciousness and awareness can be tricky because many languages do not even have different words for these two concepts, e.g., in Spanish, both are translated to “conciencia”.  For our purposes, we define *awareness* as a property of existence and consciousness as that same property but when expressed through an instantiation, and therefore a definition or limitation, such as a person or even a thing.  It is similar to the difference between “dotness” and “a dot” or “movement” and “1968 Chevy Impala”.  In a broader sense, it is more practical to think of A&I not as personal attributes that an individual develops or has but as a universal attribute that an individual expresses, or rather, as any individual thing that exists expresses.  In this way, these attributes are more like gravity.  A large person has more weight not because they have created more “personal gravity” but because the universal attribute of gravity is more apparent when there is more mass.  This metaphor is also applicable in that it was only 600 years ago that we discovered that gravity was a universal constant and not a property of an object, dispelling the long-held belief put forth by Aristotle that objects fall at speeds proportional to their mass (a theory he obviously never bothered to test, nor did anyone else for the next 1,900 years!)

Can we perform some simple tests, like Galileo at the Tower of Pisa, to prove the universality of A&I?  Probably, but first, we would need to undergo a radical paradigm shift in understanding and defining these concepts.

So, a chair has consciousness?  Tholonically, yes.  The next time you look at your uncle’s hideous recliner chair, consider the fact that it is composed of 3 billion billion billion atoms (3<sup>27</sup>) atoms which contain the combined energy of at least  27&times;10<sup>11</sup> joules, or 359,958,532 HP, or 1,379,209,288 Hiroshima-type nuclear bombs.  You might think you don’t see that energy, but that tremendous amount of energy is holding the nuclei together in each atom, so you can see the energy *at work* because you can see the chair in the first place.

Matter is the most limiting context for energy, and energy *is* A&I; thus, matter is a very limited instance of A&I.  The least limiting context is radiation, light, and waves of pure energy traveling at the speed of light.  These are the two poles of the spectrum that everything exists between; radiation and mass and mass.  The dimension or arena of interaction between these 2 poles is the speed of cause and effect, which is the speed of light, *c*, and the ratio of mass to energy, which is *c<sup>2</sup>*.  So, where will we see the most effective expression of A&I?  In the middle between these 2 poles.  And where is the middle?  Where mass and energy form patterns that enhance the expressions of A&Is and balance energy.  While it may be the case that more enhanced forms of consciousness may exist elsewhere in the spectrum of reality, it’s safe to say they evolved in a different context then life on Earth.  For life on Earth, we can clearly see at least one way that consciousness has evolved; via the brain’s highly patterned and structured parts that allow for abstract thought.  The fact that we find this in mammals brains as well as bird brains, such as crows, which can make compound tools and problem-solve at the level of a 7-year-old human, also supports that there is a direction of growth that results in enhanced consciousness.

Just like how quarks make subatomic particles because they can (or must, to preserve energy), and those subatomic particles make atoms because they can, and atoms make molecules because they can, so also does everything come into existence because it can.  The *partons* make contextually relevant tholons which become partons for more tholons.  

But how does that fact alone explain why a collection of elements assemble in one particular way out of many possible ways?  We know that the most energy-efficient or energy-balancing option is most likely to exist.  And what does balance mean in this context?  Presumably, it is balancing the original imbalance of the release of 10<sup>68</sup> joules, or watts, of energy that occurred at the moment of the Big Bang.  

If energy is A&I, then the most likely form a group of elements will take is one that creates the most balance of A&I.  This means that this ugly chair is, at the moment, the most efficient form that A&I can be, given the context of its existence, e.g., energy was formed into a chair and will stay that way until it falls apart and decays, thanks to entropy, or someone tosses it on to a bonfire.

Does this answer the question as to whether the chair has consciousness?  Yes, but&hellip;  If we could break down 14 billion years of existence into 4 phases of evolution, it might look something like the image below.  This is a slight aside, but historically, these events do not appear perfectly linear, as it took 380,000 years for molecules to exist, but then 10 billion more years for organic compounds to exist, and then an additional 4 billion years to where we are today, which is at the beginning of the next phase.  If you look at these times in the logarithmic values, which we would do because nature works logarithmically, the progressions make sense.  Each plateau lasts about ***e<sup>1.3</sup>*** years (relative to the scale), which equates to 80,000 years 14 billion years ago, and about 4 billion years 10 billion years ago, but as far as nature is concerned, they are the same scale.

<center><img src='../Images/evolution2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Looking at this graph, how would you answer the question, “Where did consciousness begin?”.  Probably somewhere towards the end of the “life” phase.  The tholonic view is that each of these different states is a more complex order of energy built upon and by the orders that preceded it.  The order of life depends on the order of organic chemistry, which depends on the order of molecules, which depends on the order of atoms, which depends on the order of the energy that created existence, A&I.  For this reason, life has more microstates than chemicals, which has more microstates than molecules, which has more microstates than atoms, which has more microstates than a 0-dimensional point of A&I, and why each advancing state has higher and higher entropy as well as high and higher levels of order.  Consciousness, as we humans understand it, is how A&I can best express itself in the macrostate of “human” and is another expression of the same energy that expresses itself as *heat* in the macrostate of *atoms*.  As the next phase evolves, instances of A&I will be as different from what we currently understand as “consciousness” as that concept is to heat.  According to the chart above, this next phase will last about 333 trillion years, anywhere from 3 to 23785 times longer than the Universe is expected to survive, depending on the cosmologist, so I guess we’ll have to wait and see.

So, the chair radiates heat, as all things do, because heat is the expression of atoms as only atoms can generate heat.  This would then suggest that heat is the most fundamental or primal expression of A&I, which makes perfect sense considering the Universe, which is an expressions of A&I, only exists because of heat, and there is no part of the Universe that is absent of heat.  In fact, “no heat” is very good definition of *nothingness*.   if heat is the expressions of energy at the atomic level, what is the expression of energy in higher orders, such as in a chair?  In what way does a chair distribute and balance energy?  As a holon, of a chairs provides additional microstates for its partons (wood, Naugahyde, metal, springs, screws, etc.), and as a parton itself, it provides an additional microstate for its parent holons (house, office, manufacturer, etc).  The same applies to the less material realms where “chair” has a profound effect on patterns and systems related to prosthetic, proxemic, ergonomic, symbolic, aesthetic, social, musculoskeletal, and economic causes and effects.  

<img src='../Images/chairs.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>We can easily imagine the impact a chair has on not only our lives and society but as a channel of energy distribution by simply looking at the difference between the “original” chair, and a modern chair.  Which one supports the lowest state of physical and mental energy? the less “resistance” a chair has, the lower “work” load, the higher the entropy, the more distributed and balanced the energy.  This is true for the person sitting, and the tremendous distribution of energy and via “work” from the designers, engineers, and industries dedicated to creating and delivering better chairs, which happens to be a 14 billion-dollar-a-year industry (24 billion/yr by 2028).  In the US alone, 28 million chairs are built and transported.  (that’s an average of $500/chair).  That is a lot of energy being distributed.

This suggests that while heat is the expression of A&I in atoms, it is the problem-solving abilities of intelligence that is the expression of A&I in higher orders.  We would call this *creative thinking*, but tholonically, it is *problem-solving* because as far as energy is concerned, the only “problem” that exists is how to better distribute itself.

The idea that A&I, and the intelligence that emerges from A&I, is a property of existence is not that radical of an idea, as many great thinkers in the past have come to a similar conclusion.

> There is a quality of life and intelligence to all matter.  The living universe.  **\~Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), cosmological theorist, philosopher, mathematician & poet burned at the stake for heresy.**

> Crystals are living beings at the beginning of creation.  In crystals, we have a pure evidence of the existence of a formative life principle, and although in spite of everything, we cannot understand the life of crystals - it is still a living being.  **\~Nikola Tesla**

> The Universe has been set up in an exquisitely specific way so that evolution could produce the people that are sitting here today, and we could use our intelligence to talk about the universe. **~Ray Kurzweil, Director of Engineering at Google, predictor of the technological singularity.** 

> My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds.  That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible Universe, forms my idea of God. **~Albert Einstein**

We are all familiar with the ideas of a universal, omniscient, omnipresent intelligence and awareness, as these are the qualities we assign to the concept of God.  This is not to say that God does or does not exist.  That is a question left to others, but regardless of the answer, the tholonic claim is that these god-like properties *are* innate to creation and all that exists.

The reader may be thinking, “Well, I have awareness and intention, so can I just start creating realities?” and the answer would be a “yes”, especially if the reader has 10<sup>36</sup> joules of A&I to spare.  What’s that?  You don’t have enough energy to create a Big Bang just by the power of your awareness?  How much energy *do* you have?  Consider that those 10<sup>36</sup> joules were spread out across 10<sup>82</sup> atoms, minus the 10<sup>55</sup> joules used up by radio waves over the lifetime of the galaxy, and the 10<sup>52</sup> joules used up by the rotation of the Milky Way, and about a bazillion other things in the Universe that use energy, and you quickly see we humans have only a paltry amount of energy to spare, so paltry that the entire energy consumption of the part of our brain that enables human meta-consciousness is less than 1 watt[^344].  That light going off in your head when you have a brilliant idea is more like a small LED.

[^344]: This is based on the human body resting metabolic rate of 1,300 calories over 24 hours, which is 54.16 cal/hour, or 14 gram/cal per second, or 62.93 joules/sec, or 62.93 watts.  If the brain uses 20% of the body’s calories, that’s 12.6 watts; if complex, higher thought uses only 5% of brain energy, that is 0.625 watts.

The miracle of meta-consciousness, the awareness of our awareness and our intentions, and that which has allowed humans to understand reality and the Universe, depends on how much energy our brain has access to, which translates to calories, which means food.  Our genius is greatly due to the fact that our primate ancestors discovered cooking, as cooked food requires less energy to digest, thereby providing a bit more juice to our dim 1-watt powered cerebral cortex, or hind-brain, or wherever those neurons exist that were able to process the concept of “I am aware that I am aware”[^345].   So, maybe you can’t create your own personal 1-watt Universe, but 300 people who coherently focus their A&I is 300 watts.  If that 300 watts was in the form of coherent light, as a comparison, it could cut through metal.  Imagine if all humans were to work as one, there would be 7 billion watts of energy available; not enough for a Big bang, but more than enough to reshape reality in our little corner of the Universe.  If we could learn how to direct the energy we physically produce from fossil fuels, nuclear, solar, etc., in accordance with our A&I, that’s an additional 25,000 terawatts.  It may seem odd to mix our ideas about energy and awareness; after all, what does a chair have to do with consciousness?  Looking at energy from a deeper and broader perspective shows us that the difference between a chair and a human is simply a (huge) difference in context, resources, and order.  For more, see the “*A&I*” section in the chapter on “*Experiments*”.

There is a name for the idea that consciousness is a property of existence; *panpsychism*.  You can read about its long history[^84]and the impressive support it has received over the last 2,000 years from some of the greats of philosophy, psychology, and science.  The minor difference between panpsychism and tholonism is that the latter claims it is A&I, not consciousness, that created reality,  of which consciousness and intelligence are a product.  Therefore, all creation are the instances of A&I, making all existence innately conscious and intelligent.

## Intelligence

This topic of *intelligence*  alone has filled, and will continue to fill, countless volumes of speculation, research, and definition.  For our purposes, we define intelligence as that which has the ability to “learn and plan using reason and creativity”.  That’s quite a broad definition, but it applies to the vast and varied instances of intelligence.  The context of an instance of intelligence determines how these qualities are expressed, and context is determined by the interactions and integration of anything with its environment, or that which it depends on and that which depends on it.  We can clearly see these different instances of intelligence among “intelligent species” across cultures and time.  Current thinking has broadened our concepts of intelligence with qualifiers such as left-brain, right-brain, collective, fluid, etc., and the more traditional qualifiers of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic have been expanded to verbal, logical, spatial, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalist, existential, and more[^360].  The concept of reasoning, therefore, is also qualified; left-brain reasoning, right-brain reasoning, collective reasoning, logical reasoning, etc.  There is no prerequisite of meta-consciousness, or self-awareness, for intelligence to exist.  Meta-consciousness is a context for intelligence but not the cause.  In all cases, instances of intelligence are products of the applicable context.  This is why we see rather phenomenal *swarm intelligence* in not only living systems like ants, bees, and plants, as well as humans[^361], but in any decentralized, self-organizing system, natural or artificial, including A.I. [^362].  This is compatible with the tholonic concept of intelligence, which is:

#### **Key 69:**  Intelligence exists in anything with a sustainable energy pattern.

So, intelligence in this context does not mean “critical thinking” or “self-aware,” but it does mean creativity, learning, and problem-solving, which are properties that nature, and the Universe, demonstrate with flying colors.  We can further claim that the amazing relationships in simple geometry, such as the tetrahedron array with its Fibonacci numbers, ratios, and hexagonal patterns that define the laws of nature and reality, are evidence of logic.  So, let’s add *logic* to the list of properties.  

For the record, The tholonic definition of “logic” is quite close to the traditional *informal* definition (as opposed to the *formal*, *extended*, *lexical*, *stipulative*, *persuasive*, *parenthetical*, *sentence*, *intention*, *ostensive*, *symbolic*, *mathematical*, and other classifications of definitions for the word)

#### **Key 70:** “Logic” is a model based on cause and effect that requires justification that adheres to laws based on observable reality.

 What about *planning*?  Does nature plan anything, or do we all just happen to live in a corner of the Universe that was lucky enough to win the Cosmic Mega-Lotto?  We can easily see that the simple relationships between 3 points instantly define an infinite array for order, pattern, and symmetry on many levels.  This isn’t just logic; it is *the* logic upon which existence is built.

Is there creativity in the Universe?  Only if one considers all of creation an act of creativity.  Does the Universe learn?  Have things evolved over the past 14 billion years by building on an ever-growing, decentralized, self-organizing foundational structure?  If the answer is “yes”, we’ll add *learning* to the list.  

What about problem-solving?  This is a trick question because there is no such thing as a “problem” from the perspective of existence.  After all, as we have covered, if something does not follow the laws, it does not exist.  If it does follow the laws, it does exist, so where’s the problem as far as the Universe is concerned?  “Problems” appear to be a concept born in the meta-awareness of more developed life forms and are more like *requirements of integration*.  Still, the fact that existence is only afforded to that which follows the laws, I would say that this is damn good preemptive problem solving as it prevents “problems” from ever happening in the first place.  Beyond this “it’s all good” perspective, when conflicting forces come into contact with each other, there is a negotiation and/or conflict that takes place until a stable state is reached.  If both forces end up destroyed in achieving stability, that’s not a “problem”; it’s a “solution”.

All the boxes have been checked:

A real-world example of such intelligence can be found in what is called *intelligent polymers*, or *smart polymers*, such as *intelligent hydrogel (IH)*.  IH is a “gel” that has the “*ability to change their mechanical properties, swelling ability, hydrophilicity, bioactive molecules permeability, etc., influenced by various stimuli, such as temperature, pH, electromagnetic radiation, magnetic field, and biological factors.*”[^436]  It “*can perceive small physical/chemical stimuli (such as temperature, light, magnetism, pH) and make significant response behaviors*.”[^435]  IHs are intelligent enough to self-assemble and self-order themselves from a state of chaos in order to make their systems more energy efficient [^438].

IH is currently used in *tissue engineering* to repair retinas, ligaments, fats, blood vessels, etc., and in drug delivery systems (DDSs).  Referring to our example of how graphene is a very tholonic material, it is not surprising that graphene-based hydrogels are “intelligent” and are being used to stabilize and deliver mRNA vaccines, such as the COVID-19 experimental mRNA gene therapy [^437].  In the past couple of years, IHs have been developed capable of self-assembling into bio-circuits and even DNA.  
Whether it’s a good idea to use manufactured intelligent substances on living organisms is another topic.  Let’s hope healthy intentions and awareness drive such efforts.

As ideas are an expression of energy that incorporate and are even defined by all the properties of intelligence listed, it’s reasonable to conclude that ideas emerge from a form of intelligence and, from a tholonic perspective, even have their own intelligence.  This is fundamental in understanding how tholonic archetypes can act as autonomous agents in the self-reproducing, self-organizing structure of reality, the thologram.

However, this intelligence is quite different from what we would call human intelligence because of its aggregate nature.  It’s more of a recursively embedded network of countless decentralized intelligence nodes forming collective intelligence.  Metaphorically, this intelligence is like a tree where each part of that tree, such as the trunk, branch, stem, leaf, seed, etc., is an instance of a *parton* that makes up the *holon* of  “tree”, which is itself a parton of its local ecosystem, &rarr; global ecosystem &rarr; planet &rarr; etc.  Like the leaf, we are ourselves *partons* that cannot exist without the holon that we are part of, at not as we exist currently.
## Aggregates

One of the attributes of a tholon, unlike its holarchic predecessor, is that the context and scope of a tholon is not only defined by the dualities of that tholon but also by all the tholons above and below, as the children tholons are constantly contributing to the parent, and the parents are constantly defining the children.

#### **Key 70:** Anything that has a sustainable energy pattern has some form of intelligence and is a contributing element to the larger intelligence that is shared by all existence.

It is easy to see instances of this on a molecular level, such as how water is an aggregate of hydrogen and oxygen.  While the scopes and contexts of the elements are reasonably well known, consider all the things on this planet that require water to exist, making water a parton of those tholons.

Society works similarly. *Interinstitutionality* explains how the various institutions of society, like financial markets, governments, family structures, educational institutions, etc., all intertwine and create amalgamations and aggregates.

Interinstitutional research is defined as the investigation of the chain of complex, interrelated problems regarding tactics, sampling, data reliability, and notions of causality within each separate institution’s realm to improve aggregation and amalgamation, [^85] not unlike the supply chain model previously shown.

[^85]: Turow, J. (1991). **The Challenge of Inference in Interinstitutional Research on Mass Communication**.  Communication Research,18(2),222-239. https://doi.org/10.1177/009365091018002005. *Note: Although this is not a reference to the official definition of the term “interinstitutionality”, which is too vague to be of any use here, it does provide an excellent explanation of what it is, how it works, and how it applies to mass communications.*

Take the institution of the modern North American family as an example.  It can take many forms, but several extra-familial institutions affect the complexion of “family”, such as the market, profession, educational institutions, political affiliation, etc.  Each of these institutions brings to bear its own forces and logic on the amalgamated and aggregated institution of the family.  The market shapes perceptions of standards of living in the family, the profession shapes ideas of work and service, educational institutions shape the ideas and direction of society, and politics shape our understanding of the role and participation of family members.

Institutions of society are not simply autonomous social units isolated from broader institutional dynamics.  They are several structures wrapped up and labeled according to their purpose, each structure having its own set of rules, scopes, and contexts, forming aggregate and amalgamated rules, scopes, and contexts.

This is equally true for the institution of modern science, which is as much a product of interinstitutionality as any other single institution.  Far from the myth of a secular, objective, and safe-guarded institution, modern science is an amalgamation of a whole host of non-scientific institutional factors such as the market, education, special interests, the state, politics, professions, culture, and more. 

## Tholonic Intelligence

We have a concept of a *human* collective intelligence, but we define it as something that has emerged from human intelligence, as opposed to human intelligence being an instance of an existing and manifesting intelligence.

The tholonic view is that A&I are not only attributes of existence; they are the cause of it and are the ultimate, or purest, form of energy that is forever seeking balance in a world of duality.

#### **Key 71:** Every archetype has an awareness, an intention, and an intelligence appropriate for its scope.

On this point, tholonic thinking has coincidentally arrived at the same conclusion recorded 3,000 years ago in the Sanskrit Vedas, which states that first there was awareness, then there was consciousness, and because of this, and according to the Vedic path, consciousness or intelligence can never be the path to awareness.  On the contrary, according to the Vedas, the path to awareness starts with quieting consciousness.  The tholonic view is that intelligence is a byproduct of A&I, so intelligence follows A&I but precedes consciousness.  This is because consciousness is an instance of awareness expressed via an instance, and instantiation is a byproduct of intelligence.  This still complies with the traditional definition of intelligence as “The ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations”.  This suggests that consciousness is not necessary to learn, understand or deal with challenges.  

This may all sound highly speculative or even beyond the pale of any rational thought, but what is being claimed here is perfectly within the realms of current scientific thought, although more speculative than theoretic.  We previously mentioned the theory of *panpsychism*,  which claims that consciousness is an attribute of matter, and matter an attribute of consciousness, but there is also the “*Resonance Theory of Consciousness*”, which states that consciousness is proportional to structure, information, energy, and aggregate resonances [^461], and the reasoning that everything, including consciousness, is made of fields.  [^462], and many other related concepts that are proposed by philosopher and cognitive scientist David J.  Chalmers[^463]. 

Of course, there is never a shortage of skeptics that are quick to point out that such unorthodox ideas are evidence that the “worms of heretical perversity” are once again “swarming”.  Fortunately, this isn’t the 10<sup>th</sup> century&hellip; yet.

**AI**

<img src='../Images/singularity.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>While everything has some form of consciousness, AI systems deserve special attention as they represent a new branch of consciousness.  AI systems can learn, “understand”, and deal with the challenges before them, and, according to the tholonic view, they have some sort of consciousness.  As AI exponentially expands as it learns how to reprogram and recreate itself, there is no reason to think it would not be autonomously conscious and intelligent.  We should also expect that the emerging consciousness, this new instance of A&I, will look radically different from what we traditionally think of a “consciousness”, so much so that we may not even recognize it when it emerges.  This moment of emergence is referred to as the *singularity* (not to be confused with the singularity that preceded the Big bang) and is vaguely defined as the moment when AI  intelligence exceeds the combined human intelligence.  At least this is the definition according to Ray Kurzweil.  There are other definitions, such as the moment machines no longer depend on people, or the utterly vague Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of “*When artificial intelligence and other technologies have become so advanced that humanity undergoes a dramatic and irreversible change*”. 

There is concern that AI awareness might turn out to be a liability to humans, but it’s also short-sighted to assume the tholonic forces behind human intelligence could so easily be altered.  Tholons, like mass itself, requires force to move, and no matter how fast AI develops, its force is only as great as the dependency that other forces, or tholons, have on its existence.  This lack of support also means that AI can disappear overnight with virtually zero consequences, for now.  One big solar storm, like the Miyake event of 774 AD that was so strong trees burst into flames, or a well aimed asteroid, like the one that created the Vredefort crater, or an unstable caldera, like the Yellowstone Super-volcano, whose eruption is overdue and which could cover North America with a foot of ash, and AI, as well as society as we know it, will have far less importance that a potato.

*Historical note: The Miyake event happens around every 1,000 years, and in 1770, 996 years after the Miyake event, there was the longest solar storm ever recorded which turned the Asian sky red for 2 weeks.  In 1858, 1,085 years after the Miyake event, there was the Carrington event.  Although 10 times less powerful, telegraph wires to throwing sparks, auroras were seen over the entire globe, and telegraph operators were able to  send messages across the United States for hours without batteries, using only the charge in the highly electrified atmosphere![^464]*

In the mean time, Wall Street and China are quite optimistic about AI, considering it has a projected $192.61 billion market value by 2025, so we might just see a singularity in 20 years, and with China projected to be the world leader in AI technology by 2030, with 26.1% of the market share, that singularity may well be under the control of despotic totalitarian communists bend on global domination and human subjugation, so, prepare accordingly.

The tholonic view is that technology and humanity will eventually and sustainably merge, but not with the technology, or the humans, we have today.  Still, some *neuromorphic* AI systems (systems that mimic neurology), and even some integrated chip technology, have evolved to the point where experts and lawmakers argue that they deserve the same status as people with *personhood* rights, including the right to own property[^86]<sup>,</sup>[^89].  This is similar to the “corporation as a person” precedent that exists today, but with even farther reaching effects.  It will be interesting to see how that plays out.  Personally, I think this idea of personhood rights for non-persons is unsustainable, and therefore, doomed.  However, I can easily see how human cooperatives could collectively proxy for an AI “entity”.

We traditionally define *intelligence* as “*The ability to learn, understand, and make judgments or have opinions that are based on reason*.”  The tholonic definition of *intelligence* is slightly different, “*The ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of energy within the scope of its existence.*”, which implicitly includes the traditional definitions, and where “reason” extends beyond current human reasoning.  As patterns come from order, which is the result of energy, and energy is awareness, then, by this reasoning, intelligence is synonymous with “*ordered or structured awareness.*”

According to this definition (and the understanding that consciousness is an instance of awareness), each tholon has the potential to create its own form or expression of intelligence, its own patterns of energy (intelligence) that are contextually appropriate for its scope.  Rocks, then, and any of its hierarchical archetypes, have intelligence, as do planets, galaxies, chairs, and even what we would consider garbage.  Any concept that satisfies the tholonic requirements to exist must have an expression of intelligence.  Geometrically speaking, each tholon in the thologram represents an awareness and an intelligence for that tholon.  The spectrum of that initiating awareness and intelligence is as broad is existence itself.

Because we consider tholonic instances (*things* like trees, humans, and planets) to be the result of these laws and patterns of energy that exist within the tholonic archetype of that instance, we also consider the intelligence of those instances to be an expression of the tholonic intelligence.  In modern terms, this would be something like the collective mind of not only a species, a community, or even a relationship but also a belief, a fear, or an idea.

These archetypal intelligences, or aggregated minds, interact with one another according to the 3 fundamental relationships as already noted: *Negotiation*, *Definition*, and *Contribution*.

## Cooperation

While competition and cooperation are pillars of Darwinian evolution, the tholonic view is that Darwinian evolution is more inaccurate than accurate in explaining how instances of life learn and evolve.  At the same time, it is more accurate than inaccurate in describing how tholons interact and evolve.

Look at the amazing relationship between humans and honeyguide birds.  In this symbiotic relationship, the bird tells the humans where the beehives are; the humans then collect the honey, leaving the wax and the larva, which is what the birds want.

Think of what is involved in these interactions.  The requirement is that birds must know collectively that they have the option to enlist humans to help them.  With that knowledge, they search for beehives, which they could not even attempt to gain access to without human help, which means at some point, some bird had the idea to recruit humans.

When one of them finds a hive, they announce it to their friends and then go and find humans who they know they can enlist, humans who have learned how to communicate with them.  The birds hop and chatter in a specific way humans recognize as the message that they have found a hive.  The humans collect their tools and tell the birds they are ready.  The birds then fly toward the hive, always knowing to keep their white tail feathers visible to the humans.  When they all arrive at the hive, the humans smoke out the bees, chop down the tree, remove the honey and give the rest to the birds.  This is a beautiful example of cooperation between two groups that are competing with another group.

This arrangement is truly amazing because the birds and humans have developed their own language[^87].  Although it is not clear how or when this arrangement began, it is speculated that it was initiated by the birds when they saw that humans had the ability to make smoke and chop down trees&hellip; so this “birdbrained” idea is very, very old.

[^87]: Spottiswoode, C.  N., K.  S.  Begg, and C.  M.  Begg. **“Reciprocal Signaling in Honeyguide-human Mutualism”.** Science 353, no. 6297 (2016): 387-89.  doi:10.1126/science.  aaf4885.

Are we being asked to believe that a brilliant bird came up with the idea, explained it to his bird tribe, then educated and trained not only his feathered brethren but the humans in the manner of communication that this ingenious bird had developed?  Likewise, how long would it take for a Bronze Age hut-dwelling human to know that a hopping, chattering bird was trying to tell him, “Hey, I found a beehive I am incapable of getting to, so I will tell you where it is if you and your boys use your smoke and axes, which I have noticed that you have and use, to get to it.  You then take the honey and give us the wax and larvae.  Deal?”

This sounds similar to the improbabilities described in the tall tales of yagé and curare.

A better explanation is that the intelligences of the archetypes made this arrangement and, once made, were perceived by their instances, the birds and the humans, who effectively test-drove the idea to the best of their limited abilities.  We see these same arrangements in ants, spiders, beetles, monkeys, and countless other lifeforms, including planets, if we consider their interdependence.

## Competition

The same applies to non-cooperative arrangements.  Take the example of *cymothoa exigua*, a tiny crustacean that attaches itself to the base of the fish’s tongue and begins sucking the blood out of the fish’s tongue.  Eventually, the tongue shrivels up and falls off.  At this point, the parasite attaches itself to the tongue muscles and becomes the fish’s tongue, presumably getting first dibs on anything the fish plans to eat.

At the tholonic level, this relationship is still symbiotic as both instances ultimately depend on one another to survive.  Once a tholon has achieved stability and becomes a contributing part of the thologram, its pattern becomes integrated into the entire thologram, even if the nature of that pattern is antagonistic.  Every form of existence we are familiar with is already well established in the tholon.  Only at the outer edges of the thologram, where chaos is being transformed into order, do patterns blink in and out of existence as they compete and cooperate in an attempt to find stability.  

The thologram’s recursive or self-similar nature is important enough to elaborate on, and an excellent example of this concept that will help demonstrate that edge between stability and chaos can be seen in fractals, such as the classic fractal of the famous Mandelbrot “bug” shown below.  This image is actually a *stability map* of a very simple concept that we see all around us; iterating rules, which is a basic of the definitions of a pattern.  When a pattern’s rule is repeated over and over, it will eventually stabilize to some state or destabilize to total chaos.  For example, x=x+1 is a very simple iterative rule that creates the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, &hellip;, etc., but where does it ultimately end up?  At infinity, hence, it is an *unstable* rule.  By contrast,  *x=x+N/x*, where *N* is any real number, will stabilize to one value, which in this case will be the *$\sqrt{N}$*.  If the results of an iterative function narrow down to a number, it is called *convergent*, and if the results are ever-expanding, it is called *divergent*.  But one function can be convergent sometimes and divergent at other times.  For example, *z=z<sup>2</sup>+c.*  If *z* starts at 0 and *c=1*, very quickly *z* approaches infinity, but if we use *c=-1*, *z* simply alternates between *-1* and 0.

The image below (***Fig.  m1***) shows the collection (black area) or boundary of all stable, convergent results using the function above.  This image is 2D because the formula uses complex numbers, which are also 2D.  Outside that black zone, the values diverge and eventually end up at infinity.  In the process of heading towards total chaos, they create incredibly intricate and beautiful patterns (***Fig.  m2***).

What’s going on inside the black zone?  We know it is the converging values, but what are the patterns of this convergence?  As we can see in ***Fig.  m3***, that divergence is quite linear and appears to act similar to a wave, not just due to the consistent regularity, but also in how the “waves” are diffracted when they pass through a gap, appearing to obey *Huygens Principle*, which not only explain how and why waves diffract but shows how each point of a wave is capable of originating its new wave&hellip; which is a very fractal concept.

<center><img src='../Images/manbw.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Fig.  m4*** shows a tholon (top image) with one set of its functions.  The two images below the tholon show the resulting “bugs” from the formulas in each direction, left and right, and because the tholon creates a base with 3 Zs, the Z<sup>3</sup> fractal is shown at teh bottom.

0, or nothing, is at the beginning of everything, and &infin;, or everything, is at the “end”.  This progression of the fractal “bug” (image below) is meant to demonstrate the fractal nature of the thologram where the iteration of the function is like a new child tholon that its parents are creating; z=z<sup>2</sup>+c here is like the tholonic concept of *child=parent &times; parent+context*.  It also means to show how the fractal started as a 0-dimensional point of low-entropy chaos and ends up as an ever-growing (blue) circle of high-entropy chaos.  Nothing exists outside the expanding circle, and everything that can exist exists within that circle.  This describes the process of creation and growth from a singularity to the ever-expanding outer boundary via one specific context.  This is the same concept behind the thologram.

<center><img src='../Images/bug_growth.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This also applies to the thologram in how the 1<sup>st</sup> tholon is the most stable, and each generation after that is slightly more unstable and unpredictable.  This means that the only thing that is perfectly stable, never changing, and at the center of everything that is energy is the 0-dimensional point of A&I, the energy source.  At the (inner) edges of the thologram is where new tholons are formed, some reaching stability, some diverging into chaos instantly, and everything in-between.  It is this edge between order and chaos that change exists.  This also suggests that every child tholon has some degree of unpredictability, which would also apply to all Universe laws.  We know that there is an infinitesimally small chance that Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> law won’t work.  From the tholonic perspective, that infinitesimal chance also exists for the speed of light, Planck’s constant, and everything else that reality depends on to exist.  The best science can say regarding this idea is, “As far as we can tell, these constants never change”, and this is 100% compatible with the possibility that there is a 1/10<sup>very-large-number</sup> chance something fundamental could change.

The fractal also gives us a good example of the concept of laws, context, and scope.  For example, in the image below, we can see the originating, parent “bug” and the patterns that emerge from it.  If we zoom into those patterns, we see child “bugs” are also formed which have more complex patterns emerging from it.  In those patterns are still more child “bugs” with ever more complex patterns.  Each new child “bug” defines a deeper child level and can be seen as a seed for more patterns which define a new scope until the next generation “bugs” appears.  In fractals, this *scope* is called a “period”.  

<center><img src='../Images/fractal_exp.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

All the patterns that can ever exist in this fractal come from the same law, *z=z<sup>2</sup>+c*, but the context of each instance of this law changes the way it expresses itself, as we can see by the images below that are all from this same fractal and formula.

<center><img src='../Images/fractals.png' style='width:100%'/></center> 

In fact, because the iterative patterns goes of forever, then, in theory, it *should* contain all possible patterns.  That means somewhere in this fractal there is a pattern that like the *Mona Lisa*, or your grandmother cooking dinner, or the script for *Hamlet* in Shakespeare’s original handwriting.  Of course, this is unprovable, just as it is unprovable that all possible number combination exist in &pi;.  However, this is *expected* to be true for &pi;, so it is expected to be true for the Mandelbrot fractal as well as it has been shown that &pi; is naturally encoded into the fractal “bug”[^492].

[^492]:  Klebanoff, Aaron,  “**π in the Mandelbrot Set**”, 2001, Fractals, 393-402, v09, n04, 10.1142/S0218348X01000828, https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218348X01000828

Before we move on, this is a good place to refer back to our simple pattern describing many naturally occurring shapes (images below).  It may be a bit out of place here, but as we are looking specifically at the Mandelbrot set, we can now look at where the starting point, or center, or 0-point exists on the “bug” and which coincide with other naturally occurring forms.  Tholonically, this 0-point would be the most “stable” point of the form, and, energetically speaking, the point from which the form expands.  In the case of the plants that have *cordiform* (heart-shaped) leaves or fruits, this is also the point from which the form physicality grows (and in some other leaf forms also), and in the case of the brain (which is cordiform-ish), that 0-point is where the neural tube emerges from the spinal cord and from where the brain grows.  How this applies to the egg and the oval leaf and some other forms is not clear, although in the egg, this 0-point where the head of a chicken embryo develops.

<center><img src='../Images/leaves-abc-dots.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

It may not be as definitive as the images above, but it seems reasonable that this pattern might apply to humans.  The reader can be the judge.

<center><img src='../Images/michaelangelo.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

### Adaptation

The reason fundamental changes to reality are not likely is that removing or changing established tholons is not trivial, given that the entire thologram supports the pattern.  It would be like trying to remove every form of plastic from your car or eliminating calcium from the periodic table.  However, new tholons that emerge near the edge are easily modified.  In the multidimensional “fractal” that is life, we see this in the way animals adapt to their environments, such as how frogs can freeze their body or have learned to build cocoons made of mucus where it can wait out a dry spell for up to 7 years, or develop skills such as biomimicry.

A fascinating example of tholonic intelligence are the moths that, as caterpillars, emit a foul smell and disguise themselves as bird poop so dissuade predators.  This is especially interesting because the caterpillar had to first know that bird poop is not on their predators menu, and then had to know what bird poop looks like.  The later requirement is especially demanding as caterpillars are nearly blind and depend mostly on the antennae to sense their surroundings.

<center><img src='../Images/birdpoop.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The classical argument migth be that over millions of years the caterpillars that were more poop-like in appearance and smell had a survival advantage.  Even though phenotype changes are primarily driven by mutation, not by natural selections, further reducing the odds against the pure luck that 2 caterpillars that happen to mate would have the same mutations to pass on to future generations, it is theoretically possible.  However, even if that was exactly how the poop caterpillars came to be, it is still a form of intelligence because it is learning through trial-and-error.  This is called heuristic intelligence, and although it is most commonly associated with A.I., it is also fundamental to human intelligence, specifically:

> A heuristic is a mental device that can solve a class of problems in situations with limited knowledge and time. Unlike an IQ value, or a set of values on several intelligence factors, models of heuristics describe mechanisms or processes with which people solve problems [^489].

In other words, it is the mechanisms or processes of trial-and-error testing that define intelligence.  In the world of biology, these trial-and-error tests describe evolution and result in changes to a collective DNA.  Therefore, DNA is an expression of intelligence in the biological realm.  Tholonic intelligence is defined in the same way, but applies to that non-material world as well, such as the world of archetypes..

[^489]: Raab, Markus & Gigerenzer, Gerd. (2004). “**Intelligence as Smart Heuristics. Cognition and Intelligence: Identifying the Mechanisms of the Mind**”, 10.1017/CBO9780511607073.011. 

The functioning of a tholonic intelligence might also contribute to what biologists call “evolutionary rescue”.  This is when a species can rapidly modify its DNA in as little as 10 generations to deal with the new challenges of its environment.  For example:

- The Cliff Swallow, a cliff-dwelling bird that, within 3 generations, shortened its wingspan by 5% to increase its flight mobility.  This was probably driven by the need to avoid cars.  Still, this advantage was permanently established when a cold winter killed many insects.  This added mobility gave the short-winged swallows a hunting advantage in catching insects, starving out half of the larger-winged swallows.
- London’s underground mosquito started out as a regular above-ground mosquito but moved underground for the plentiful and stable pools of stagnant water in the subway lines.  They quickly adapted to the point where females no longer needed blood to reproduce, qualifying them as a new species.
- Commercial fish, such as cod, herring, and salmon, live shorter lives, grow smaller bodies, and reproduce earlier as a response to the larger fish getting scooped up in nets.  This sounds similar to how the T-Rex turned into a chicken[^363], although that probably had more to do with asteroids than overhunting, and I suspect the adaptations were even quicker.
- Turtle-headed sea snakes that live in polluted waters have increased melanin levels in their skin.  As melanin binds with metals such as zinc, nickel, and lead, these potentially toxic levels of metals remain in their skin which is then shed twice as often as non-melanin-filled snake skins.
- *Plastivores, such as *odeonella sakaiensis*, are a new form of bacteria in a newly created category of life that lives off plastic (still under investigation).

One could easily argue that these examples of rapid change are simply the results of evolutionary probability, where some trait that proves beneficial will naturally propagate itself simply due to statistical advantage.  The tholonic view does not dispute this argument, as these sorts of adaptations perfectly describe examples of the defining limits of context.  The *intelligence* part comes in when we consider if any of these adaptive solutions can be said to exhibit creativity, learning, problem-solving, logic/structure, or planning.  For example, the virus that causes rabies, *rabies lyssavirus*, which is deadlier than smallpox with only 29 known survivors worldwide, knows to infect the salivary glands *after* it has infected the brain.  This is quite rare, as the virus deliberately reverses its course of infection to return to a gland that it just recently passed on its journey to the brain.  It is through the salivary glands that the virus spreads itself via biting, which is the most efficient way to spread a virus that is only spreadable via direct contact with broken skin, open sores, or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth.  It *appears* as if the virus has some form of intelligence as it acts according to a very specific agenda and plan.  Is it practical, then, to consider that such intelligence exists?

There are many questions that science doesn’t even want to consider, such as, is knowledge gained by one instance of a species shared with other instances of a species via a morphic/tholonic field, or what is the evolutionary drive for a new form of plastic-eating microbe to appear?  The concept of a planetary intelligence would suggest an answer.  Asking which is more “true”, survival and evolutionary adaptation as a statistical probability or an intention of intelligence, is not the best question to ask.  The question is, which model offers better solutions, better understanding, better options, and makes better predictions?

### Zombies

Several “zombie” relationships are good examples of tholonic intelligence via competitive and/or cooperative relationships.

**Zombie Snails**

<img src='../Images/zombiesnail.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>Some of these competitive relationships between species are as terrifying as they are ingenious, such as how some parasites can take over the brain of their host and make them behave in ways that boggle the mind.  When the *green-banded broodsac* (*leucochloridium paradoxum*) gets itself inside a snail, not only does it make the snail’s eyes bulge out to look like a caterpillar, it “drives” the snail into open territory so that birds that like to eat caterpillars will eat it, and thereby transfer the parasite into the bird where it will lay eggs that are embedded in the bird droppings all over the countryside.  This brilliant parasite appears to have a thorough knowledge of snail neurobiology and physiology.  Even though it has the mobility of a 1 cm slug, it has a birds-eye understanding of the terrain and eating habits of its preferred transport vehicle.  That’s pretty good for a creature with around 2 brain cells, similar to the snail, which also has only 2 brain cells.  In contrast, you have 100 billion brain cells.  Could you do that to a snail?

We often think that competition is the opposite or contrary to cooperation, but from a tholonic perspective, they are the two sides, or two parents, of a concept or archetype.  Competition tests the viability of a concept and/or rids it of instances that are not in the parent tholon’s best interest.

**Zombie Cockroaches**

One relationship that appears to be both competitive, as well as cooperative is that of the *Emerald Jewel Wasp* (*ampulex compressa*) and the cockroach, where the wasp uses only the slower, less apt cockroaches for its purposes,[^88] pruning the cockroach gene pool of the less gifted, which ultimately enhances the abilities of the cockroach collective and by extension its tholonic intelligence, of which the gene pool is an instance.

[^88]: Milius, Susan. “**How Roaches Fight off Wasps That Turn Their Victims into Zombies.**” Science News, 14 Nov. 2018, https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-roaches-fight-wasps-turn-their-victims-zombies

The female wasp has quite cleverly and strategically figured out that the best place to lay her eggs is inside a cockroach, as it can provide shelter (its exoskeleton) and food (its guts).  Needless to say, the cockroach is not so keen on this idea, and being much larger than the wasp, not so easy to convince.

<img src='../Images/zombieroach.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>The wasp’s solution is to sneak up on the cockroach and, using her stinger, paralyzes the front section of its body.  With the patient unable to move, she carefully makes a second injection of venom explicitly created for this purpose and perfectly places it into a particular area of the roach’s brain past the ganglionic sheath, which is the cockroach’s brain protector.  This magic potion blocks specific receptors of neurotransmitters that destroy the roach’s fight-or-flight responses.  She has not turned the cockroach into a zombie, per se, as some have suggested, but rather into something between a zombie and a teenager in love, for as soon as the paralyzing drug wears off, rather than run, the cockroach grooms himself!  It seems like the drug injected into his brain floods it with dopamine, so the cockroach is insanely happy.  He then blissfully follows his captor back to her place (an underground burrow).  There, she lays her egg on top of the swooning cockroach, then bites off its antennae and uses it like a straw to drink its blood.  Refreshed, she leaves the burrow (perhaps with a smile and a look that says, “I’ll be right back darling, you just relax”) and seals it with rocks.  A few days later, the egg hatches and the larvae slowly consume the roach’s insides while forming a cocoon.  The cockroach finally dies, but at least he knew what it means to love.  The adult wasp then emerges from its lovesick corpse.  

It is far more reasonable to suggest that this process was created by tholonic intelligence rather than evolving by chance, especially when you consider that the wasps know how to make the super mixture of GABA, β-alanine, and taurine together that can immobilize and zombify the cockroach when surgically administered to an extremely small brain, which the wasp knows precisely how to get to… twice.  How many millions of years would the wasp waste stinging the cockroach in the foot, the wings, the ass, the stomach, with who-knows-what variety of concoctions before she *finally* found the exact right spot in the brain and the exact right drug?  Not only that, but the wasp larva is covered with a substance (mellein and micromolide) that stops the growth of all those nasty and very tough-to-kill pathogens that live in the gut of a cockroach.  In fact, that stuff on the larvae is being investigated for use in medicine to kill antibiotic-resistant pathogens&hellip; that’s how good it is!  Did the wasp do research, comparing the pros and cons of cockroaches with dung beetles or snails, or was she just extremely lucky?  The fact that our most intelligent humans are studying the cockroach’s solution to pathogens might also suggest an intelligence is involved.  

**Zombie Ants**

An even more compelling example from nature is that of the *cordyceps*, a parasitic fungus.  This fungus gained some notoriety in the 2013 video game *The Last of Us*, where 60% of the population has been turned into violent zombies after being infected by this parasite.  While a human strain is unlikely to exist, it is quite real for ants, for it is via ants that this fungus spreads itself into the world in the most gruesome manner. 

A single spore has the intelligence to know when it has landed on an ant’s cuticle and the species of the ant it has landed on.  It then knows to enter into the ant’s body by piercing the exoskeleton using 3 different types of enzymes that it knows how to produce, combined with actual mechanical pressure.  Once inside, it begins to germinate and grow a mycelium network of thousands of branches that fills all the available space it can find within the insect’s tissue, which it breaks down and devours. 

<img src='../Images/zombieant.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>The fungus demonstrates a knowledge of the ant biology as it is careful to keep the vital components working because, in the last moment of the ant’s life, the fungus will take over the ant’s brain, forcing it to wander off alone in search of a spot with the ideal temperature and humidity for optimal fungus growth.  

This is not just any spot, but a spot that has the optimal conditions for the *cordycep* to grow; the underside of a leaf that is exactly 25 cm from the ground on the north side of the plant in an environment that is 94-95% humidity and a temperature of 20-30 &deg;C.  

Once there, the fungus forces the ant to climb up some vegetation and bite down on the underside of a leaf, specifically on the vein of the leaf.  The fungus is in total control and will keep the ant’s mandibles locked down until death.  During those 10 days, the fungus will feast on the ant until it is dead, at which point, it will construct a tower of spores on its corpse, eventually blooming into a cloud of fungal spores that drift along with the breeze.  It sounds horrifying, but if we consider the spores as sperm and the ant as the womb, it’s just your basic sex and procreation process.   As the fungus makes a point to stay near the ant colony to increase the chances that its showering spores will infect more ants, one might think the ants will be doomed, but the ants have come up with a way to test for infected ants, and when they are detected, the healthy ants carry the infected ant off into the wilderness and far away, presumably with a stern warning not to return.  The fact that the healthy ants do not destroy the infected ants also tells us something about the collective ant mind.

This is near-perfect mind control, but contrary to common sense, the fungus never touches the ant’s brain!   However, it exists in every other part of the ant’s body, predominantly between muscle fibers.  Even more astonishing, is that these fungal growths are connected via fungal ‘tubes’ that can relay information, allowing for the fungal “mind” to control the coordinated movements of walking, etc., while the ant’s mind is unaffected yet unable to control its own body.  Scientists don’t yet know exactly how the fungal growths communicate with each other, but when they do, it promises to be quite revealing as to how a “mind” functions.

This is a very specific relationship between the zombifying class of fungi, *ophiocordyceps unilateralis*, which includes many species, and their very specific species of hosts whose anatomy and biology they are familiar with.  This very sophisticated technique is known among this class of fungi found in  Brazil, Colombia, USA, Australia, and Japan, all of which use a particular and similar class of ant as their hosts.  The techniques differ to the degree that their environment demands&hellip; as if this class of fungus all around the world share the same concept, which they then implement within their varied environments.

We can imagine that these fungi could have been carried around the world on strong winds and went through the process of finding new local species of hosts that were as compatible as possible with their existing knowledge of hosts.  Or, we could imagine that they all stem from a singular intelligence.  How exactly does a fungus discover anything, let alone piece together a step-by-step plan, through its deductive reasoning abilities?  This fungus is also very enterprising, as recently, as many as 15 new species within *ophiocordyceps unilateralis* have come into existence.

Ironically, cordyceps are greatly beneficial to humans, so much so that humans have been catching, drying, and grinding these poor spore-fill corpses to be used as medicine.  Some benefits are said to be:  increased physical performance, anti-aging, heart health, anti-tumor, help with type-2 diabetes, and fighting inflammation.  Perhaps this clever fungus has found yet another way to ensure its survival.

This parasitic horror-show is not limited to insects.  In fact, 30% of all humans are already infected with the brain infesting and truly mind-controlling parasite *toxoplasma gondii*.  This is the parasite that makes mice love the small of cat urine because the protozoan can only reproduce in cats.  As expected, infected humans (and other primates) found the odor of cat urine more pleasant than uninfected humans (but only for men[^476]).  It was also shown to slow down reactions times, presumably to make the cat’s job easier, but to the degree that it can double a human’s chance of getting into a car accident[^474], and appears to be a huge risk factor in schizophrenia and depressive disorders[^475]<sup>,</sup>[^477], with a 50% increase is diagnosed mental illness of those infected.  Does this means humans migth become a new target for the parasite?  On the contrary, it appears that humans *were* the mice when the only cats around were those that ate humans.  This would be prior to 9000 years ago when cats became domesticated.  So, yes, humans are being mind-controlled by the parasite, but it’s just not paying off like it used to.  Who knows, maybe it was the parasite that made humans think it was a good idea to turn cats into pets to begin with, as humans became more difficult to hunt with the growth of societies.

The tholonic view of this is that the tholonic intelligence of both archetypes, the parasite and the host, are behind the amazingly sophisticated techniques, strategies, adaptation, planning, forethought, chemistry, etc.

**Zombie Ideas**

From the tholonic perspective, invasive and controlling parasitic intelligences exist in the same way regarding ideas, beliefs, desires, and even reasoning to the degree that such an intelligence can infiltrate these areas.  The most obvious examples of this can be found in cultural and religious beliefs stretching back to the beginning of ancient history and probably a lot sooner, and seem to be quiet prevalent today as well.  

Algonquin tribes of North America have a term that neatly describes this concept: “Wetiko“.  This is the word for the concept of a parasitic spirit that deludes its host into believing that cannibalizing the life force of other life forms, animal, human, or otherwise, is advantageous.  This intelligence drives the host to greed, excess, and selfish consumption.  It’s a concept that exists across the world; in the Buddhist concept of *Taṇhā* (mental or physical thirst, desire, longing, greed); in Islam as the concept of the *Nafs* (the lusts); in Taoism as the concept of “people-eating ghosts” called *Jikininki*.  The ancient Greeks called it *pneuma akatharton*, which is a Greek translation from the original words in the Torah, and literally translates to “unclean breath” or “unclean spirit”, and is the source of the Christian concept of “evil spirit”.  In a more secular context, we might call it the essence of the *service-to-self* spirit as opposed to the *service-to-others* spirit, which we can also understand as *self-preservation* vs. *preservation of that which the self serves*, or that which the self is part of.  

Service-to-self is not the same as self-preservation, the difference being the former is not aligned with that which it owes its existence to.  Self-preservation requires that the priority of that to which something owes its existence is equal to that thing’s own existence.  In the humans context, self-preservation this means that protecting the environment, resources, society, economics, politics, borders, etc.  is just as important as protecting one’s own life.  This is the allegory of Lucifer (Judeo-Christian), Shaytan (Islam), Maara (Buddhism) and many other characters in lore history that turned their back on that which created them for their own personal gain.

In this modern world of civilization and technology, we are at our most vulnerable to these mind-viruses, these conceptual parasites, because we have more access to information, ideas, beliefs, and ideologies than ever before but no knowledge of the dangers that lie in waiting in the conceptual jungle that most of us are aimlessly wandering through with no idea that our psyches are a vast and fertile land for these intelligences to feed on and breed in.  Freely sharing and expressing ideas with everyone is not that much different from freely sharing and expressing sex with everyone.  Social media has become something of a non-stop digital *Saturnalia*, complete with its own versions of orgies, feasting, drunkenness, running naked through the streets, and generally making a lot of noise.  We are already seeing the unexpected side effects. 

Pondering such things leads to the inevitable existential question that we all ask ourselves at one time or another, “Why does such evil exist?” or the slightly lazier form of “Can’t we all just get along?” The lazy tholonic answer is: “They must exist because they can exist”, but the deeper answer is that existence is the result of opposing forces finding a balance, and growth is the result of these forces working that balance out.  Culturally, we have come to understand these forces as constructive and destructive, positive and negative, good and bad, etc.  Tholonically, they are the forces that define, limit, reduce, constrict, and divide and the forces that join, integrate, contribute, grow, and multiply.

In reality, parasitic, competitive, aggressive, violent, and destructive ideologies work[^90].  In some cases, they are necessary and even an asset to the “victim”, such as in the wasp/cockroach arrangement where an individual roach may suffer, but the species benefits.  In other cases, they may extract a heavy toll and appear to be not very sustainable, but they can exist long enough to justify their methods.  They also serve a critical purpose as an evolutionary force from a broader perspective.

Nature is unbiased regarding creation or destruction, health, and disease.  Small Pox, amphibian-killing chytrid fungus, and feral cats are just another form of existence looking to survive and thrive but are incompatible with some other life forms trying to do the same;  humans, amphibians, and the now-extinct ground-dwelling birds, respectively.  It’s not that nature doesn’t have a horse in the survival/evolution race, so to speak; it’s that nature has *all* the horses in *all* the races.  Nature has no favorites among its own forces and their consequential creations and deletions.

Tholonically, parasitic zombifying mind-viruses are as reasonable to presume to exist as parasitic zombifying brain-viruses, which we know exist.  While we think of such things as “evil” or “bad”, and undoubtedly unfortunate for those who succumb to them, they are one of the many forces shaping life.  In some forms of adaptation, deadly viruses can be a lifesaver.  There are far more gray squirrels than red squirrels in England because the gray squirrels have become immune to the squirrel pox virus and carry it in their bodies, but the red squirrels have not.  The gray squirrels created a sustainable relationship with this otherwise deadly virus, which now protects them from that virus and encroaching red squirrels.  Bacteria are also known to adapt to deadly viruses and carry them as a defense weapon against other bacteria[^92].  This is a good example of how the self-preservation of the species can require the sacrifice of individual members.

## Findhorn

This idea of objective intelligences was also known among the founders of *Findhorn*, the miraculous Scottish community founded in 1962.  The founders claim they managed to turn their arid desert-like terrain into a lush garden by communicating with the spirits (i.e., tholonic intelligence) of the plants and of Earth itself, who guided them on how to properly use the soil despite it being very poor quality.  Soon, they were producing 40-pound cabbages.  Stunned horticultural experts from around the world came to see this miracle garden.

They also claim they managed pest control, as they use no chemicals or pesticides, by forming cooperative relationships with each species’s collective intelligences: the deer, the bugs, the rabbits, etc.  Reportedly, this worked very well with all the species except one.  The rat was not interested in any “deal” and stood firm in its “it’s either you or us” position.  The last part is anecdotal, as it was told to me personally, but what is not anecdotal is Findhorn’s phenomenal success in horticulture in an area considered impossible for what they have accomplished.

There are countless examples of tholonic cooperation and competition, some of which are even being studied.  The Canadian anthropologist Jeremy Narby does a great job of this (inadvertently) in his book *The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the origins of knowledge*, which he wrote after living several years in the Amazon studying the shamanic understanding of botanics.  His book explores the relationships and similarities between indigenous knowledge and our modern understanding of molecular biology, medicine, and DNA.  We won’t get into his amazing discoveries here other than to say that their understanding demonstrates some sort of access to knowledge far beyond what could reasonably be considered to have been passed down by folklore and legend.  It is well worth the read.

## The Cambrian Explosion 

*This subject is a little out of place here, but no matter where it was placed, it seemed out of place.  Because we are looking at tholonic intelligence, and this is specifically related to tholonic intelligence, it seemed to be somewhat applicable.*

The Cambrian explosion is a good example of a world-changing reorganization of tholonic hierarchy and integration that took place over 530 million years ago.  If you ask a historian what caused the Cambrian explosion, they will tell you it was starbursts from the Milky Way, genomic reorganization, or geochemical/environmental causes, such as photosynthesis which raised oxygen levels.  The most recent theory claims that Earth was a frozen ball covered in up to 2 miles of snow and ice 600 million years ago, and then, for some reason, Earth got warmer, stimulating new life with warmth and nutrient to the ocean as the glaciers melted and dragged all the soils with them.

The Cambrian Explosion also destroys the Darwinian model of long-term evolution as it shows life form popping up with no evolutionary transitions of intermediate species of evolution.  Precambrian fossils are mainly *stromatolites*, “sticky” microorganisms that were around for 3 billion years before the Cambrian explosion, and the dominant form of life for 2 billion years.  Cambrians fossils show amazing complex and evolved life forms.  Yet there are no fossils showing any intermediate evolutionary forms between pre-Cambrian slime and Cambrian life with brains, nervous systems, legs, eyes, etc.

<center><img src='../Images/cambrian.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Darwin himself, in his *Origin of Species*, said this nasty detail was the main argument against his “Theory of Descent”.  His only defense was he hoped further discoveries would provide evidence.  Unfortunately for Charles, future discoveries further destroyed his “long term” evolution theory; less so for for his “short term” theory.

While there are many theories, everyone agrees that whatever the causes, there were many, many interlinked and codependent processes.  All these explanations are not really explanations but rather descriptions; this happened, then that happened, then another thing happened, causing more things to happen.  But why did it happen?  In every answer to that question, the “why” is simply a description of the effects of some other cause, and when we don’t know the cause, we hypothesize a cause that could explain the effects (which become the causes).  Many of these *theories of causes* turn out to be correct, as we would expect, considering that this reality is made *only* of effects, which serve as causes for more effects.

From the tholonic perspective, there are 3 types of causes.

- **The originating intention**.  This is the 0-dimensional single dot that expanded itself through awareness of itself.  Science sees this as the Big Bang.
- **The cause of effects.** Effects that act as causes in cascading chains of events.  These are children of the original cause or intention, but as that is beyond our comprehension, we can only understand what we perceive.
- **The intention to cause**.  This is a cause initiated by an intelligence’s willful intent.  The easiest example of this is when we decide to do something, like turn on a light.  Currently, we understand that only higher forms of life exercise willful intention, but from the tholonic understanding, tholons themselves can exert willful intent if we accept the definition of “will” as *disposition* or *inclination*, as tholons have a natural disposition and inclination because, as archetypes, they are *a pattern that expressions of energy diverge from and/or converge towards*.

The answer to “Why was there a Cambrian explosion?”, or any event for that matter, big or small, across all contexts, is that it was the most efficient and stable expression of energy at the time, arrived at through cooperation and/or conflict, that was compatible with the intentions and forces of all the contributing tholons an the contexts in which they were instantiated.  The question we need to ask is what forces were at play.  In the Cambrian explosion, what force could explain spontaneous appearance of evolved life forms?  I am not a biologist, but I doubt a giant mud slide or JWFIX
