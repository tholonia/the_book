- **power loss = I<sup>2</sup>&times; R**
  *Power loss = (current * current) * resistance
  Thus as the current doubles the power loss increases by 4.**

- By the Renaissance, observations had improved so that the old simple models were seen as failures, at least mathematically. With the work of Oresme, Buridan, Copernicus, Tycho, Kepler, and Galileo, we saw that Aristotle's ideas had been questioned, then debated, then jury-rigged, then dethroned and tossed aside. To physicists and astronomers, Aristotle's ideas were irrecoverably flawed. *But while Aristotle had been dethroned, he was not yet replaced.*  https://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/physics/astrocourses/ast203/newton.html

Plasmonic antennas.  Plasmonics, or what is sometimes called nanoplasmonics,  is the term for electrical interfaces at light frequencies which allows it to perform operations such a changing the direction of light, and using light as the source of energy, and has the potential of creating electric circuits as small as 10 nanometers.  That is 10,000 times smaller that a human hair, or the amount your fingernail grow in one second.  



A plamonic antennas can recieve energy and informations.  When graphene is copled with gold, teh energy can be direted and cirtuits cr5eated

Pain amd pleasure

Hwo it attention and awareness directied?  There are many spiritual metaphyscial techniques to learn this, but the one ethind that we are born with as it si hult into our neing as it crtial to our suruval is sile pain.  Paion of perhaps the most effective and efficient way to instantly focus one’s attention and intention.  Pleasure also does this, but I suspect it takes a back seat t pain when it come to whic ne has high p[riotry as far as awareness and intention goes.  The different between pain and pleasure, at least as far as this discussion is concerned, it the diretion of intention.  AS awareness is energy, the direction of intebntions will deternime where that energy goes, and wherever energy goes, more structure, more pattern, more order will appear.  Pain in the body signifies somethign is not badamaged or not working properly.  Energy applies to that spot will act to return whatever it damaged to its most efficient state.  Pleasure, oin ten potehr hand, is nto about repairing someth8ign gamaged, but enhancing something to a better state.  As fixing somethign is more impoetant than expanding something, pain is more compelling that pleasu
