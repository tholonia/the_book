# 10: FIELDS

###### Fields are forces of influence; electrical, <u>conceptual</u>, unknown, or otherwise
##### **Synopsis:** 

##### **Keywords:**

We know a lot about fields already, so it is reasonable to examine fields in general based on what we have learned.  For example, if we use the <u>concepts</u> used in <u>electricity</u>, we can speculate the following as a starting point.

- <img src='../Images/emfields.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>**A field is composed of two parts that are always perpendicular to each other .** One part, the electric field, is the result of potential energy or the position of the charges, and one part, the magnetic field, is the result of kinetic energy, or the movement of the charges, so we have a concept of a "potential field" and the "kinetic field".  The electrical field is created by voltage (potential), or charge, and exists even if there is no movement of energy.  The magnetic field is created by current or amperage (kinetic), and only exists where there is a flow of energy.
- **Potential fields can perform "<u>work</u>"** as they can change the state of matter.  This is based on the fact that electrical fields can alter the speed and direction of matter.
- **Kinetic fields (may) carry <u>information</u> and cannot perform <u>work</u>** as they do not affect the state of matter.  This is based on the fact that the state of matter, such as its speed and direction, is unaffected by a magnetic field.  Because we have stated that <u>information</u> is <u>data</u> plus <u>energy</u>, which implies <u>movement</u>, and because the <u>kinetic</u> field is the result of the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>, we can suggest that the <u>kinetic</u> field contains <u>information</u>.
- **These fields transmit <u>energy</u> through <u>waves</u>.**  We say this because <u>electrons</u> are not the <u>energy</u> itself; they are the medium through which <u>energy</u> is transported.  So, where is the actual <u>energy</u>?  It is in the field that surrounds the medium, such as a wire.  These <u>energy</u> fields travel *through* the <u>electrons</u> in the wire, not *on* them, at the <u>speed of light</u>.  It's similar to the way <u>waves</u> are created when you drop a rock into the water.  The <u>waves</u> travel outward at some speed, but the water <u>molecules</u> are not traveling outward at that speed; rather, they are just bobbing up and down as a result of the <u>energy</u> <u>wave</u> traveling *through* the water.  In this example,  <u>electrons</u> are like water <u>molecules</u>, water is like the electromagnetic field, the container of the water is like the wires, and dropping a rock is like flipping the "On" switch. 
- **The transmission of <u>energy</u> requires a disturbance to the fields.** Just as the rock in the above example created a disturbance in the water by the release of <u>energy</u>, the release of <u>energy</u> by closing a circuit causes a disturbance in the electromagnetic field.  In the case of <u>electricity</u>, the <u>waves</u> always travel at the <u>speed of light</u>, unlike the water <u>waves</u>, which move at a speed relative to the size and velocity of the rock.  This is because there is no matter to factor in with electromagnetic fields.
- **The material used to conduct these fields can be any material that responds to the <u>energy</u> carried by the field.** Energy causes things to move, and it will always seek to dissipate/<u>balance</u> itself in those things.  This is that "path of least <u>resistance</u>" stuff again.  If it is easier to move an <u>electron</u> in a copper wire than it is to move an <u>electron</u> in nitrogen-filled air, then that is what it will do, and that is why wires <u>work</u>.  The <u>energy</u> itself, including any <u>information</u> it may contain, is carried in the electromagnetic fields, and the wires are used to direct the flow of those fields.  Fields don't need wires to travel as they can travel through the air, water, or even space, but it is very difficult to control and direct the fields in these mediums.  This also applies to the <u>energy</u> of <u>ideas</u> and <u>concepts</u> and their conductive medium, the mind.
- **The conductive material is simply a means to move the <u>energy</u> and is not altered (much) by the <u>energy</u> (within the limits of the capacity of the material).** When <u>electricity</u> moves through a wire, the <u>electrons</u> only move about 1/10 of a millimeter per second in a DC current.  In an AC current, they jiggle back and forth 60 times a second. 
- **Fields contain embedded fields.** The idea is derived from the observation that a magnetic field can exist with the <u>movement</u> of a local <u>energy</u>.  For example, a static magnetic field can be created by the <u>movement</u> of <u>subatomic particles</u> (<u>electrons</u>, <u>protons</u>, <u>neutrons</u>) called “spin”.  Everything is magnetic but in most substances the direction of the spin of these particles is 50/50, half spinning in one direction, and half spinning in the opposite direction, so the <u>magnetic</u> fields <u>balance</u> each other out.  In some metals, like iron, all the particles spin in the same direction, creating an imbalanced magnetic field.  It is the attempt of this imbalanced field to <u>balance</u> itself that creates magnetic fields we see in magnets, <u>planets</u> and elsewhere.  We call this an embedded field because it is a field that exist on a more fundamental level than that of <u>electricity</u>, and even when there is no magnetic field on the circuit level, there are countless magnetic fields in play at the subatomic level. 

The most important point is that <u>energy</u> travels via fields.  This is true even in the case of <u>electricity</u>, even though “common sense” tells us the <u>energy</u> is traveling through the wires.  Wires simply allow for the direction of the fields.  When we use Ohm’s <u>law</u> or even Newton's <u>laws</u>, we are describing relationships that are caused by fields.  Even <u>mass</u> itself can be described as a product of field interactions if we consider <u>waves</u> as the result of <u>energy</u> traveling through a field (which is how <u>quantum mechanics</u> defines it).  In fact, <u>mass</u> itself may simply be a measure of the <u>energy</u> of a <u>wave</u>.[^346]

#### **Key 59:** Fields are the context for the <u>energy</u> that creates <u>waves</u>, and everything is a <u>wave</u>.



With all the above in mind, lets explore <u>tholonic</u> fields.

If <u>tholons</u> are themselves forms of <u>information</u>, then we come back to the question, “Where is this <u>information</u> stored?” This is a question that has been pondered for ages. One example would be the somewhat <u>Buddhist</u> <u>concept</u> (in that it was coined by a <u>Buddhist</u> in 1884, but adopted by other beliefs) called the *Akashic Records* which is said to be “a compendium of all human events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future”. This might be a bit ambitious for our purposes, but the idea is essentially the same… that of a ubiquitous, timeless non-physical record of (at least) all <u>aggregate</u> thought forms. If our claim is that this also describes the thologram, then where and how does it store this <u>data</u>?

Let’s review…

Our claim that the original source of <u>energy</u> is primal Awareness and Intention, and as such, Awareness and Intention is a property of <u>existence</u>.  This is consistent with some current scientific models, especially in light of the experiments that have shown an inextricable relationship between reality and <u>awareness</u>.  Although there is much discussion these days about <u>consciousness</u> and reality, <u>Archibald Wheeler</u>, one of the mega-heavy-weights of <u>quantum mechanics</u>, a colleague of <u>Albert Einstein</u> and <u>Niels Bohr</u>, a mentor to many of today’s leading physicists, and the man who chose the name “<u>black hole</u>,” was perhaps the first modern scientist to prove that <u>awareness</u> is required to bring the universe into <u>existence</u>.

As Wheeler put it:  

> No phenomenon is a real phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon.[^321] We are participants in bringing into being not only the near and here, but the far away and long ago.[^324]

Towards the end of his <u>life</u>, he said he had only enough time left to <u>work</u> on one idea: that **<u>awareness</u> shapes not only the present but the past as well.**

<center><img src='../Images/099-splitslit.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

We already have the proof of <u>awareness</u> causing <u>waveforms</u> to collapse into particles, as we can see in the _split-slit_ experiment.

Briefly, this split-slit experiment shows that when observed, <u>electrons</u> act like particles, and when not observed, they act like <u>waves</u>.  The act of observation forces the <u>electron</u> <u>waves</u> to be perceived as particles.  It’s not that the <u>electrons</u> are <u>waves</u> that turn into particles; it’s that the <u>electrons</u> are *wavicles*, both particles *and* <u>waves</u> at the same time, but the act of observing them, of introducing <u>awareness</u> into the context, changes the context and <u>scope</u> of the expression, which then alters its instantiation.  It was stated earlier that the <u>archetype</u> of something and its instance are the same thing in different contexts.  Here, the “<u>wave</u>” quality of an <u>electron</u> is the <u>archetype</u>, as it defines its field and its probabilities.  Once the field interacts with another field, i.e is observed, its context changes.  It’s like the difference between having credit and making a purchase. Having credit means you have the <u>potential</u> to buy something.  If you are in a shoe store, there is a high probability you will buy shoes. You may have the idea to buy red shoes (the <u>archetype</u>), but you don’t know exactly what red shoes you will buy until you are holding a pair in your hands (the instance of the <u>archetype</u>) and the transaction is approved.

We also have evidence of how <u>awareness</u> can (possibly) change the reality of the past as well, as demonstrated in Wheeler’s *<u>delayed-choice experiment</u>*[^324].  In addition, Penrose wrote an entire book on the subject of cognition and reality (*The Emperors’  New Mind*).  He even came up with a term do describe the <u>awareness</u>/reality continuum: the _<u>Orch-OR</u>_[^326], or *orchestrated objective reduction*, which attempts to explain how <u>consciousness</u> and reality are intertwined.  The idea of reality being a product of <u>awareness</u> is not at all “fringe” and hasn’t been for some time.

Looking at this <u>tholonically</u>, each <u>tholon</u> has its own field, and that field is a parent field within which the child <u>tholons</u>, with their own subfields, are created.

We noted how magnetic fields can be created by the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>\.  These magnetic fields are a form of <u>energy</u>, so just as the <u>movement</u> of <u>electricity</u> can form a magnetic field, so too can a magnetic field form <u>electricity</u>.  No <u>energy</u> is being created, just changed from one form to another form.  This transformation, specifically in the case of <u>electricity</u> and magnetism, is called *<u>induction</u>*.  As the word implies, induction is the “*ability to persuade or influence (someone or something) to do something.*”  Thus, every field, at every level,  can induce anything in its proximity to change in some way and to some degree.

Applying this to the thologram, at the “top” we have a very simple field, which exists between the 1<sup>st</sup> two poles created by the primal dot and which have the properties we have labeled *<u>Definiton</u>* and *<u>Contribution</u>*, and which instantiates in various forms depending on their context. Every child field is induced by its parent (and ancestors and peers), and the parent is induced by the child (and all descendants, and peers).  Thus, the thologram is one large field of ever-embedded fields all inducing one another, all of which are expressions of the primal <u>awareness</u>, all of which are interacting with, and dependent on, one another.

There are many legends, stories and theories, ancient and modern, attesting to the power of <u>awareness</u>.  We won’t get into them here other than to say that if reality and <u>awareness</u> are intertwined, then it would be reasonable to expect that just as reality has an effect on <u>awareness</u>, <u>awareness</u> can have an effect on reality, especially as <u>awareness</u> is an integral part of <u>reality</u> and not simply an effect of <u>evolutionary</u> causes.  This is easier to accept when speaking of human <u>awareness</u>, but how does this associative relationship manifest in other instances, such as plants, rocks, <u>planets</u> and elements, all of which are some expression of the primal <u>awareness</u> to begin with?

## Morphic-Fields

As late as the 1950s, some scientists and most people in general thought that plants and even animals were little more than biological machines and that outer-space was just a bunch of hot and cold balls floating around according to Newtonian and Keplerian <u>laws</u>.  Since then we have come to discover that plants have “feelings”, <u>monkeys</u> can form sentences and talk about their emotions, the <u>universe</u> is not only a lot bigger than we thought, but there may be countless parallel versions of them.  We have seen how everything is connected in one way or another, at least on the quantum level - just to name a few of the changes to our worldview.  We are moving ahead in our thinking and <u>understanding</u> at an incredible rate.

Sadly, some of the old guard is a tough bunch that is doing their best to keep us from making progress, not unlike the 9<sup>th</sup> century Archdiocese.  Take the long-time editor of *Nature* magazine, <u>Jim Maddox</u>, who stated, regarding <u>Rupert Sheldrake</u>’s book on morphic-fields:

> [his book] is the best candidate for burning there has been for many years.  Sheldrake’s is not a scientific theory.  Sheldrake is putting forward magic instead of <u>science</u>, and that can be condemned, in exactly the <u>language</u> that the Pope used to condemn <u>Galileo</u>, and for the same reasons: it is heresy.[^93]

[^93]: Media, T. E. (2015, June 02). Rupert Sheldrake, **Heretic**. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSd4DA5xhHw>

Yes, he actually cited <u>Pope Paul V</u>’s condemnation of <u>Galileo</u> as a <u>defense</u> on the grounds that *heresy* is the real crime.  This sounds eerily similar to “swarming with worms of heretical perversity.”

This alone should paint a pretty clear picture that modern <u>science</u>, for all its breakthroughs in <u>understanding</u> and progress, has become a modern-day <u>religion</u> in the hands of the truly dogmatic that seem to be in charge all too often.  Dr.  <u>Richard Feynman</u> himself noted this when he stated:

> We live in an unscientific age in which almost all the buffeting of communications and television, words, books, and so on, are unscientific.  As a result, there is a considerable amount of intellectual tyranny in the name of <u>science</u>.[^94]

So, why are the modern-day versions of <u>Tomás de Torquemada</u> (Grand Inquisitor in the <u>Spanish Inquisition</u> of the 15<sup>th</sup> Century) and his ilk, impaling the venerable and brilliant Rupert Sheldrake on the spikes of modern mainstream scientific dogma? Well, it seems that Sheldrake, himself a Cambridge professor who studied at Harvard, was onto something with his *<u>Morphic-Field</u> Theory*, and it rattled their cage.  Perhaps they feared that the “worms of heretical perversity” would begin to devour the carcass of their dying scientific worldview.

Sheldrake’s Morphic-Field Theory, which he described in his 1981 book, *A New Science of Life*, posits the <u>existence</u> of organizing fields which are systems that <u>self-organize</u>, create <u>structure</u>, and have <u>patterns</u>.  Morphic-fields are not a type of <u>mass</u> nor an <u>energy</u> but are organized *by* <u>energy</u>, like everything else.  Morphic-fields are described in the same way as holarchies in that they are made up of parts, which are in turn parts of wholes themselves.  At each level, the morphic-field supports the <u>structure</u> of its whole and organizes its parts.

Morphic-fields described  (in 50 words):

> &hellip;located invisibly in and around organisms, and may account for such hitherto unexplainable phenomena as the regeneration of severed limbs by worms and salamanders, phantom limbs, the <u>holographic</u> properties of <u>memory</u>, <u>telepathy</u>, and the increasing ease with which new skills are learned as greater quantities of a population acquire them.[^95]  **\~Rupert Sheldrake**

[^95]: Sheldrake, Rupert. **A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Formative Causation**. Los Angeles: J.P. Tarcher, 1981.

A more complete description is:

> A morphic-field (MF) is a field of <u>energy</u> that imposes <u>patterns</u> on otherwise <u>random</u> or indeterminate <u>patterns</u> of activity.  Morphic-fields transmit <u>information</u> via morphic-resonance (MR), which is the influence of previous <u>structures</u> of activity on subsequent similar <u>structures</u> of activity organized by morphic-fields.  MR has the capacity to store and transmit <u>information</u> and therefore it can act as a memory bank for any self-organizing group, such as self-organizing systems; <u>molecules</u>, <u>crystals</u>, <u>cells</u>, plants, animals and animal societies.  Each member of a group can <u>contribute</u> and draw from this <u>memory</u> bank. **~ excerpt from Rupert Sheldrake’s letter to <u>John Horgan</u>, writer for Scientific American**[^96]<sup>,</sup>[^97]

[^97]: Sheldrake, R. (n.d.).**Morphic Resonance and Morphic-Fields - an Introduction**. <https://www.sheldrake.org/research/morphic-resonance/introduction>

The idea of MFs was an epiphany that Sheldrake had in 1971 as a way to explain how living things knew how to grow when that <u>information</u> was not stored in its <u>genes</u>.

The very first known example of an MF test actually goes back to 1920, long before the <u>ideas</u> of MF arrived, when Harvard professor <u>William McDougall</u> proved that children of mice that have learned a maze can navigate the maze much faster.  After 20 generations of maze running mice, the next generation was able to run the maze 10 times faster than their pioneering ancestors.  As genetics could not account for this transference of <u>knowledge</u>, it must have been something else, something <u>science</u> didn’t know about.  To investigate this mystery, a team in Edinburgh set out to prove McDougall’s test was pure poppycock.  Unfortunately for these researchers, their 20<sup>th</sup> generation mice knew how to go straight to the target on the first try.

They had no idea of morphic-fields back then because if they did, they would have known that the Edinburgh mice benefited from the <u>knowledge</u> of the Harvard mice, even though they were thousands of miles apart, thanks to the transference of <u>information</u> via the MF/MR.  There have been many other examples like this over the last 100 years.

The way this MF <u>information</u> is transmitted is via MR, according to Sheldrake.  All members of a group that share an MF have access to the MF info because they naturally resonate with that field, not unlike how we can pick up radio <u>waves</u> when we have a <u>crystal</u> that resonates with the transmission <u>frequency</u>.  Dogs share <u>information</u> with dogs, <u>humans</u> with <u>humans</u>, etc., but a bond between a dog and a human creates another MF that they both share.  Sheldrake shows examples of this in how <u>dogs</u> know when their owners are coming home and start waiting for them by a door or window.[^98]<sup>,</sup>[^99]

Because of their ability to transmit <u>data</u> across time and space, MFs have been considered for communication in long-distance and interstellar travel[^100]<sup>,</sup>[^101].  MFs may also be capable of creating self-organizing systems within the realm of <u>AI</u>.

A lot more research is needed in the area of MF and MR, but this is slow in coming given the oppressive dogma of modern <u>science</u>.[^102] Others have been working on similar <u>ideas</u>, such as theoretical physicist <u>Lee Smolin</u>, with his idea of the *principle of precedence*[^103], which states that the history of measuring a particular quantum event will determine (or affect) the future measurements of that same event when it is measured.  Unfortunately, unlike the world of <u>physics</u>, <u>biology</u> has become more dogmatic in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

One small detail, but hugely significant, is that morphic-fields originate outside of <u>space-time</u>.  They exist in the realm of thought, or <u>awareness</u>, or <u>consciousness</u> (or all three).  <u>Information</u>, as we currently understand it, cannot travel faster than the <u>speed of light</u> (in the 3D reality) but does this apply to <u>awareness</u>? According to the <u>tholon</u> model, no, it does not, because reality and the Universe *is* <u>awareness</u>, and <u>awareness</u> is 0-dimensional, and therefore transcends the <u>limitations</u> of space-time. There has been some research on <u>awareness</u> and morphic-fields[^104], but it’s scant, and the results are far from clear-cut.

## Beyond the Body

Many people believe that one’s <u>awareness</u> can, with practice, travel outside of the body, and outside of this physical reality.  This is typically called an *Out of Body Experience* (<u>OOBE</u>), or *Astral Projection*.  Mainstream <u>science</u> is not a fan of this idea.  *Scientific American* suggests that OOBEs are caused by inner ear problems[^105].  This view, although not surprising, is disconcerting considering that some real research on OOBEs has shown remarkable evidence.  There are many examples of such research[^106], such as <u>Dr.  Tart</u>’s subject being able to read the letters “P = 10<sup>-5</sup>” or “25132” that were written on a remote piece of paper while out-of-body[^107].  Practitioners have reported faster-than-light, instantaneous, “travel”, which would be possible in the 0-dimensional space of Awareness.

Tholonically speaking, OOBEs are not just possible, they are inevitable. The <u>concept</u> of “<u>soul</u>” is an umbrella term to describe “ancestor” <u>tholons</u>, or the <u>tholons</u> that we emerged from.  Adepts at <u>consciousness</u> anchoring can anchor to any <u>tholon</u>.  This might explain how, as it says in the <u>Majjhima Nikāya scripture</u>, it was possible for <u>Buddha</u> to remember all his lives going back 90 eons, (with 1 eon being the lifespan of the solar system).

Although this sort of research does not get the attention it deserves, with a bit of <u>effort</u> it can be found.  Science is not well equipped to study the mechanics of <u>awareness</u> or any non-material phenomena.

Fields of <u>awareness</u>, such as morphic-fields and <u>tholonic</u> fields, while being able to instantiate in the material world, are not limited to the restrictions of the material world, and it is inevitable that we, as instances of <u>awareness</u>, will discover them.

#### **Key 60:** Tholonic and Morphic-fields have the ability to transmit and store <u>information</u>.
#### **Key 61:** Tholonic-fields are not limited by time and space.

## <u>Tholonic-Fields</u>

The current idea that MFs can be formed as a result of a self-organizing system, as Sheldrake describes them, are limited to systems that exist, systems that have real-world instances, such as <u>species</u>, societies, etc. Ideas exist and are self-organizing as well, so why wouldn’t MFs apply there? Well, they would, but with a difference.  In the MF model, it is the instantiated members of  the MF that are receivers and transmitters of <u>information</u>, and therefore the reception and transmission of <u>information</u> among the living are dependent on the ability of the members of the over 200,000,000 <u>species</u> of <u>life</u> on the <u>planet</u> to transmit and receive.  If we applied the MF model to <u>ideas</u> as <u>archetypes</u> not limited by their instances, than what is receiving/transmitting <u>information</u> in this MF that *<u>ideas</u>* are a member of?

Sheldrake implicitly answers this question when he describes the morphic-field as “*organizing fields which are systems that self-organize, create <u>structure</u>, and have <u>patterns</u>*”.  This description is that of a form of <u>intelligence</u>, and therefore the morphic-fields that share a <u>morphic-resonance</u> or morphic cloud are capable of transmitting and receiving between themselves, not only with their instances.  Tholonically speaking, this would also mean that the <u>archetypes</u>, the <u>tholons</u>, are also both transmitters and receivers of <u>information</u>.  The <u>tholonic</u> view also considers the material reality to be a contextual expression of a <u>field</u> in the material reality, and there is no difference between the field and the form other than context, as they are the same thing. In the MF model, <u>humans</u>, dogs, and <u>ants</u> are forms of <u>life</u> that resonate with fields. In the <u>tholonic</u> model, <u>humans</u>, dogs, and <u>ants</u> *are* those fields in a material context.

The theory of <u>Morphic-Field</u>s attempts to explain why and how <u>ideas</u> simultaneously spread across a morphic group, such as <u>humans</u>.  Examples of this are how Leibniz and Newton both came up with the idea of calculus at the same time, or how cubic equations, considered to be one of the greatest milestones in mathematics history, was simultaneously discovered by <u>Nicola Tartaglia</u> and <u>Scipione del Ferro</u> in the 16<sup>th</sup> century.  Morphic-fields are also capable of inter-group communication, such as between <u>humans</u> and dogs, as cited in Sheldrake’s book *“Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home*”.

In the <u>tholonic</u> view, these same phenomena exist between <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetypes</u>, and these <u>tholons</u>/<u>archetypes</u> can have direct communication with each other without having to go through any of their instances.  That interaction can also include <u>negotiation</u> via cooperation and/or conflict, or result in a redefining or <u>contributing</u> of both <u>archetypes</u>.  Tholons can battle, join together, form alliances, trade, aid, lie, extort, and even destroy other <u>tholons</u>.  This <u>understanding</u> does a better job explaining the wasp/roach or honeybee/human relationship, but also sheds light on everything from <u>religion</u> to <u>economics</u>.  

At the time of this writing (August, 2020), within the social arena, which includes economics, <u>politics</u>, <u>government</u>, <u>culture</u>, civil rights, and so much more, we are seeing some extraordinary <u>movement</u> of <u>tholonic</u> activity in the social realm as a result of the global pandemic and subsequent lock-down, itself a creation of a <u>tholonic</u> <u>intention</u>, which will alter all aspects of <u>society</u>.  As the activity increases, a wider array of <u>tholons</u> will be <u>contributing</u> to the cause and effect of the situation-at-large to the point where <u>concepts</u> unrelated to <u>health</u>, government, and economics will come into play and be changed in ways we may not be able to imagine.  Of course, what we are seeing today is itself a child of the changes that have been happening for hundreds, and even thousands of years.  It might seem obvious that events like famine, war, or <u>disease</u> would be very disruptive.  While that is true for us poor human instances, on the <u>tholonic</u> level, they are business-as-usual.  Far more disruptive (on the <u>tholonic</u> level) are the new classes of <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetypes</u> that never existed before and are changing reality.  Some example of these more recent <u>archetypes</u> might be:  

- The discovery of quantum phenomena (1801).
- Nuclear <u>fission</u> and <u>fusion</u> (late 1930s, early 1940s).
- The invention of digital <u>information</u> (1948).
- The invention of <u>genetic</u> engineering (1970s).
- Quantum Computing, <u>AI</u>, genetic technology, and similar bleeding-edge changes will be added to this list.

These are just some of the changes that have, and will, permanently and radically alter the direction of growth for many <u>archetypes</u> and their instances, and consequently, the fabric of reality and our <u>understanding</u> and perception of it.

It is a small step from here to presume that with even a little <u>understanding</u> of reality, the <u>tholonic</u> model could easily “predict” future discoveries.  This has already happened to some degree.  In one of the numerous cases of self-learning <u>AI</u>, the <u>AI</u> agent scanning only the words (which are themselves <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetypes</u>) of documents combined the <u>concepts</u> of  “chalcogenid”, “optoelectronic”, and “photovoltaic applications” to create a new <u>concept</u> of a thermometric <u>archetype</u> that the <u>AI</u> identified as *CsAgGa<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>*[^108].  That was in 2009.  In 2012, that compound was discovered.

## <u>Ideas</u>

The natural ordering as a result of the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> is obvious (we hope), but for this to apply to <u>ideas</u> we would have to accept that <u>ideas</u> themselves use, transmit, or transform <u>energy</u>.  There are two arguments to support that they do.

- An idea cannot exist in a state of total <u>nothingness</u>.  If an idea exists, then it must do so somewhere on the spectrum of some <u>duality</u>, therefore, it must have some kind of <u>energy</u> passing through it.
- An idea or <u>concept</u> has <u>coherence</u>, or low <u>entropy</u>, and represents a product of “<u>work</u>” or the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>, which produces fields and oscillations of that <u>energy</u>’s <u>movement</u>.

#### **Key 62:** Tholonic-fields are the fields generated by the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> through an archetypal <u>concept</u> that has been discovered or created.



Morphic-fields are the instantiations of <u>tholonic</u> fields as expressed by the instantiations of that <u>archetype</u>. This brings us back again to the question: how and where is all this <u>information</u> that is being accessed stored? How does a <u>tholon</u> know the limits of its <u>scope</u>? How does it access the <u>information</u> needed to inform its <u>intelligence</u>? How does it “remember” context or “learn”?

The first place to look for an answer is in the manner that <u>tholonic</u> instances have devised to store and transmit <u>information</u>, and the obvious choice of instances is *<u>humans</u>*.  If we look at how we <u>humans</u> store the <u>information</u> we have collected from the <u>conceptual</u> world we may be able to discover analogous processes that apply to the world of <u>tholonic</u> and morphic-fields.

And how *do* we store that <u>information</u>? We invent an abstract <u>symbolism</u>, apply meaning to it, call it <u>language</u>, use that <u>language</u> to record those symbols, and then, most importantly, teach our children how to decode these symbols.  This shares some similarities with the process the <u>honeybirds</u> have developed, and maybe even with the <u>dopamine</u> injecting <u>wasps</u>, but the difference is they do not (appear) to have a way of recording or sharing their <u>collective</u> <u>knowledge</u> as <u>humans</u> do.  Perhaps this is because <u>humans</u> have lost touch with this <u>information</u> field, as suggested by Jaynes, so they had to invent their own techniques like writing, talking, the Internet, cloud storage, etc.  Perhaps we may not be aware of the symbolism being used by our *field <u>intelligence</u>* to collect, store, and transmit <u>information</u>, or perhaps we are aware of it but don’t know how to understand it.  Because we do not know, or have not been taught how to recognize or understand these symbolic messages, we have to assume they could exist anywhere, and everywhere.

#### **Key 63:** We don’t know what we don’t know.



Let’s look at some of the more likely candidates of how and where we might find and access this *field <u>intelligence</u>.*

## <u>Telepathy</u>, <u>ESP</u>, or Something

Can we describe this field <u>intelligence</u> as some sort of telepathy? And if so, do we even have any evidence that telepathy exists?

The idea of telepathy has been around forever, but modern <u>science</u> insists it is all pseudo-science hogwash, right?

Not exactly.  Not only is there a mountain of evidence to support its <u>existence</u>[^109]<sup>,</sup>[^110]<sup>,</sup>[^111]<sup>,</sup>[^112] and even a drug named after it, *<u>telepathine</u>*[^113], but the (technology-enhanced) telepathy business is booming!

- Many research projects developing telepathic processes and products.[^114]<sup>,</sup>[^115]<sup>,</sup>[^116]
- U.S. military (<u>DARPA</u>) developing telepathy-based weapons.[^117]
- *Elon Musk*, Facebook, and others all developing telepathy-based <u>tools</u>.[^118]<sup>,</sup>[^119]<sup>,</sup>[^120]<sup>,</sup>[^121]
- <u>Google</u>’s *neuroprosthetics* (<u>brain</u> augmentation <u>nanobots</u>[^319]<sup>,</sup>[^318]) that will, according to their director of engineering, <u>Ray Kurzweil</u>, not only result in human <u>hybrids</u> by 2030[^316], but will “make us godlike”[^317] (we are assuming these godlike powers include telepathy, ESP, and more).

While it’s true that a lot of research and development in the area of telepathy is based on technology-induced telepathy, such as “<u>neural clouds</u>” which will be indistinguishable from current data-clouds, it is still driven by the idea of telepathy.  In other words, we have the <u>understanding</u> and belief that telepathy is a real phenomena that can be improved upon.

Sheldrake himself has a lot to say supporting the <u>existence</u> of some sort of telepathy in the documentary “*Scientific Evidence of Telepathy: Documentary.”*[^122]

[^122]: King, T. (2017, May 30). **Scientific Evidence of Telepathy - Documentary**. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ4G3IRVFwU>

<u>Russel Targ</u>, a former physicist at Stanford Research Institute and author of *“The Reality of ESP: A Physicist’s Proof of Psychic Abilities”*, has experimented with telepathy and ESP for some time now.  He shows[^123] that the scientific evidence for ESP is statistically stronger than the evidence that aspirin helps reduce stroke.  The aspirin test was so statistically significant that the test had to be called off because it was considered unethical to continue giving test subjects placebos in light of the overwhelming evidence they had collected before the test was even completed.  I know it’s a rhetorical question, but why are we not seeing this revolutionary telepathy/ESP research all over the news? The evidence is compelling enough to accept that telepathy, in some form, is a thing.

The umbrella “or something” category can cover quite a bit of territory, including lesser-known applications of our sensory-processing skills, such as the ability to smell personalities and emotions[^124]<sup>,</sup>[^125] or, if you’re a woman ovulating, your superhero-like ability to immediately recognize gay men and hidden snakes[^126] (the elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles, not the metaphorical type, although I suspect research would show significant results for the latter as well).  Some <u>humans</u> have a visual sense 100 times more sensitive than the average person.[^127] And what of the extensive intrinsic nervous system in the <u>heart</u> comprised of clusters of <u>neurons</u> sufficiently sophisticated to qualify as a *<u>heartbrain</u>*? Certainly, that must contain some sort of sensory processing abilities.

Perhaps the most overlooked, yet strongest sense we have is what we call our *<u>gut sense</u>*.  Considering that our gastrointestinal tract contains 95% of our body’s <u>serotonin</u>, has its own nervous system, and is filled with trillions of <u>microbes</u> sending terabytes of <u>information</u> to the <u>brain</u> every millisecond, microbes that are 100 times in <u>number</u> than the cells in the rest of the body and 10 times the <u>number</u> of cells in the <u>brain</u>, all of which having a significant impact on the <u>brain</u>,[^128],[^129] one would have to consider the *gut* as a powerful organ with its own senses.[^130] Knowing this, perhaps we should start considering what microbes we are exposed to at birth that so dramatically affects our <u>brain</u> growth.  Those born under natural conditions are exposed to the microbes of their natural surroundings.  How do C-section births and exposure to the microbes of hospitals, urban dwellings, and processed food, alter our <u>brain</u> and gut development?

Our model of 5 senses is quaint, at best, and that is being generous, especially considering it was proposed over two thousand years ago by the same philosopher, <u>Aristotle</u>, who held back physics for centuries with some of his completely inaccurate <u>ideas</u> about such things as <u>gravity</u> that were proven wrong sixteen hundred years later by <u>Galileo</u>, and <u>atoms</u>, which were theorized by <u>Leucippus</u> and <u>Democritus</u> one hundred years before Aristotle declared the idea as nonsense.  Why do we persist in holding on to such antiquated <u>ideas</u> about something so fundamental to our <u>understanding</u> of ourselves, <u>society</u>, and reality?

Perhaps what we call some forms of telepathy or ESP are simply quite natural consequences of senses we have that we don’t know or believe we have or choose to ignore.  Just look at some of the amazing senses of some insects and animals as an example of the abilities of their genetic machinery:

- <u>Buzzards</u> can see small rodents from three miles away.
- <u>Bees</u> have a ring of iron oxide in the belly to feel magnetic fields and have eyes that see polarized light.
- A <u>cockroach</u> can detect <u>movement</u> 2,000 times the diameter of a hydrogen <u>atom</u>.
- <u>Elephants</u> have a hearing range of 1 to 20,000 hertz, and can also hear with their nose and feet.
- The <u>shark</u> has special eyes that can see <u>electricity</u>.
- When you look at the sidewalk, you see cement and dirt, but that same sidewalk tells a bloodhound of someone who has walked there eight hours ago, what the soles of their shoes were made of, and what brand of cigarettes they smoked.
- <u>Dolphins</u> see sound <u>waves</u> as 3D images.

#### **Key 64:** Transcendental or extrasensory forms of communication exist.



Telepathy or otherwise, it’s a safe bet to say that some form of <u>transcendental</u> or extrasensory form of communication exists, and this might be a way to access <u>tholonic</u> <u>data</u>.  It’s the specifics of it that seem to be elusive.  Proving such a thing is similar to asking me to prove that Australia exists.  I know many people from Australia, I can find Australia on a map, I know of Australian politics and history, but all of that is anecdotal as I have never been to Australia and if you asked me to prove Australia’s <u>existence</u> by the strictest scientific standards, I could not without actually going to Australia.  All I could say is I have a lot of evidence from trustworthy sources, as opposed to, say, proving that Earth is not flat even though I have never filmed Earth from space.

Dawkins suggests that <u>memes</u> are the non-genetic manner in which <u>information</u> is passed on.  He also strongly disagrees with Sheldrake’s morphic-field hypothesis.  Unfortunately for Dawkins, <u>memes</u> cannot explain test results that morphic-fields can.  To add insult to injury, morphic-field theory not only has room for <u>memes</u> but can explain one way that <u>memes</u> can spread, so, Sheldrake: 1, Dawkins: 0.

What mechanism actually does the transmitting and receiving among animals, <u>humans</u>, perhaps even plants and rocks? After all, they too have a form of <u>awareness</u> and <u>intelligence</u>.  Their <u>collective</u> mind? Their <u>energy</u> fields? Their physical <u>structure</u>? We don’t need to know the specifics of *what* just yet.  Let’s consider the *how* by looking at how we <u>humans</u> have learned to send and receive <u>information</u>.

When you want to send something to somewhere, how is that done? Maybe you use a postal service or your computer network.  In either case, you are collecting the <u>information</u> and delivering it *not* to the final destination, but to a service or infrastructure that does the delivering.  This is the case with <u>radio</u>, television, <u>electricity</u>, and even <u>nature</u> if we consider how <u>seeds</u>, an instantiated form of <u>information</u>, can be transported around the world via air, water, hiking boots, animals and in the case of mushroom spores and <u>viruses</u>, intergalactically via meteors and space-wind.  These “<u>seeds</u>” are not only carriers of <u>DNA</u>, but possibly <u>information</u> or messages from off-world <u>intelligence</u>, according to some researchers[^134], including Dr.  <u>Francis H. C. Crick</u>, the co-discoverer of <u>DNA</u>, who, in his paper *Directed Panspermia*[^135], hypothesized that the <u>DNA</u> itself arrived from space.

[^134]: Crick, F., & Orgel, L. (1973). **Directed panspermia.** Icarus, 19(3), 341-346. doi:10.1016/0019-1035(73)90110-3

It is easy to imagine applying the well-developed model of telecommunications that we currently use, called the *Open Systems Interconnection* model, to a model of information-sharing among various forms of <u>intelligence</u>.

<center><img src='../Images/096-ISOstack.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

To be clear, we are not saying that this is how it works, nor are we saying this is *not* how it works.  We are suggesting that we might find new perspectives if we apply the models we have developed, which are based on natural <u>laws</u>, to things we do not yet understand.  In this case, for example, we see that the physical body and <u>intelligence</u> are at the opposite ends of the pyramid, implying that the <u>brain</u>/nervous system is more of a receiver/transmitter rather than a generator, as creating new <u>information</u> requires <u>intention</u>, cognition, and <u>intelligence</u>.  This is a radically different <u>concept</u> than the current mainstream and antiquated idea that the mind, <u>consciousness</u>, and <u>intelligence</u> *must* arise out of <u>brain</u> activity.  Other successful models that we currently use today could also be applied to things we do not yet understand, at least as a starting point of investigation.

Still, none of this addresses the specifics of where the <u>information</u> is stored or <u>transmitted</u> from.

## Collective Memory

The idea that a field <u>intelligence</u> is in some way an extension of the idea of the *<u>collective</u> mind* or *<u>collective</u> <u>consciousness</u>* was formalized to a great degree by Carl <u>Jung</u>’s idea of a <u>collective</u> subconscious and <u>collective</u> memory, although, it may be more accurate to describe the idea of a <u>collective</u> unconscious as a primitive <u>understanding</u> of *field <u>intelligence</u>*.  This is still a very fertile area of research across many disciplines.[^136]

[^136]: **Collective Memory.**(n.d.). <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/collective-memory>

Sadly, no theories exist to explain where and how long-term <u>collective</u> memories are stored.  In the West, the idea of a <u>collective</u> memory has been around since the early 20<sup>th</sup> century French sociologist <u>Maurice Halbwachs</u> coined the term.  His hypothesis on how <u>collective</u> memory was stored and transmitted is extremely unspecific but generally depends on human-to-human transmissions, similar to Dawkin’s theory on how <u>memes</u> are spread.  Given that Halbwachs was a student of <u>Emile Durkheim</u> and a devoted Marxist, one has to question his entire premise of a “<u>collective</u>,” especially in light of his claim that human memory can *only* function in a <u>collective</u>, and then goes on to give examples of his hypothesis of <u>collective</u> memory by comparing the “<u>collective</u> memory” of the bourgeoisie, <u>religious</u> and the working class, which may be valid, but is extremely myopic.  Still, he did coin the term, even if his premise was infected by a virulent and parasitic ideology (not unlike the Emerald <u>Wasp</u>).

Current thinking still revolves around <u>cultural</u> expression as being the primary way that <u>collective</u> memories are transmitted; dance, stories, monuments, etc.  These are certainly reinforcing factors, but this idea alone cannot explain Man’s <u>collective</u> memory of “the whole history of the human race”, as <u>Jung</u> claims is the source of our fear of fire, falling, and social status, to name just a few.  Some of these memories are <u>epigenetic</u>/genetic, such as being born with the fear of loud noises, which comes from the memory that loud noises are generally a harbinger of something that’s bound to make <u>life</u> more difficult, but can all our <u>collective</u> memories be stored in our <u>DNA</u>? Perhaps that is what the 75% of our junk <u>DNA</u> holds (recently upgraded from the previous 98% junk), or perhaps we don’t yet understand its function.  Maybe the junk <u>DNA</u> is more of an antenna than a transcoder? Apparently, we have no idea, but whatever it is, could it account for storing “the whole history of the human race”?  This seems very unreasonable.

One place worth exploring is where and how these <u>patterns</u> exist is the epigenetic transmission of experiences and memories passed on to descendants.  Why epigenetics?  Because Epigenetics appears to be one of the more effective ways that contextual <u>information</u> is learned, stored and passed on.  In one of the classic test cases, the descendants of mice that were trained to not like the smell of cherry blossoms also had an aversion to the scent of cherry blossoms.[^159]Epigenetics describes how <u>DNA</u> can be modified by non-genetic stimuli, like <u>fear</u>, <u>love</u>, environmental preferences, even dreams, and it shows how what we inherit may go far beyond the human <u>genome</u>.

## Engrams

Another candidate is how the <u>brain</u> creates and stores memories.  We have developed the <u>concept</u> of an *engram*, which is the means by which biochemical and biophysical processes store our response to external stimuli.  The engram, first described by German Zoologist Richard Serman in the early 1900s, was based on what he called the *mnemetic principle*, which states that the imprint made in the nervous system (including the <u>brain</u>) can, when stimulated by external stimulus, reconstruct the experience.  This is a very <u>holographic</u> idea, in that <u>holograms</u> reconstruct imagery by illuminating a previous record of that imagery.  The images below demonstrate how the “memory” of the image of a 3-dimensional cat can be stored on a 2D surface of <u>holographic</u> film, but looking at the film we would have no way of knowing that there is any <u>information</u> there, let alone the <u>information</u> that describes a 3D cat.

An important technical detail regarding <u>holograms</u> as it applies to memory is that many images can be recorded on top of each other, each with a different angle of illumination.  All those images can be reconstructed simply by changing the angle of the <u>hologram</u> when viewing.  This is why, and how, a <u>holographic</u> memory cube the size of a small closet (5m<sup>2</sup>) can store every word ever spoken or written by all <u>humans</u>.[^138]

[^138]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte>

<center><img src='../Images/097-holograms.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

This imprint, or “mnemetic trace”, so named after the Greek muse of memory “Mneme,” is also a precursor to Dawkins “<u>meme</u>,” as the <u>meme</u> is a <u>cultural</u> version of an engram.

The 50 years of research following Serman’s hypothesis of the engram boils down to, for our purposes:

> (1) memories are not localized but are instead distributed within functional areas of the cortex and
> (2) memory traces are not isolated cortical connections between inputs and outputs.[^139]

Might we see these same characteristics in our own <u>collective</u> memory technology otherwise known as the Internet? Perhaps.  Decentralized and distributed <u>information</u> networks, such as Bitcoin’s Blockchain, TOR (The Onion Router), and IPFS (Interplanetary File System) are probably early stages of such a thing.  The irony of the Internet is that when it was originally developed by DARPA, it was designed to be much more decentralized then it is today to the point where it could withstand a nuclear attack and continue operating, but today much of the decentralization has been removed as it is not in the best interests of government and business who prefer a more “consolidated” model (many totalitarian countries, and England, have actual Internet kill switches[^140]).

[^140]: “**Internet Kill Switch**.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 24 Jan. 2019,<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_kill_switch>

If we extrapolate these <u>ideas</u> when looking for how field memory works, we might want to start with the presumptions that *field memory* is decentralized and distributed within the medium of the field.  What and where is this medium? Anywhere there is <u>energy</u>, as the field *is* <u>energy</u>, although when referring to the context of instances as opposed to the pure <u>archetypes</u>, then the instances themselves would be a part of the medium as well.  Field memory is not stored as discrete <u>quanta</u> of <u>information</u> but rather an organized <u>pattern</u> of otherwise dis-integrated “particles” of <u>information</u>, which we refer to as <u>data</u>.  Were we to see this <u>data</u> alone it would appear as <u>chaos</u>.  When seen from a different perspective, or decoded, or “restimulated,” as in the case of engrams or <u>holograms</u>, or in a different context, it may appear as <u>information</u>.

## Modulation

Another model to look at might be the way we have learned to transmit <u>information</u> by modulating the amplitude or <u>frequency</u> of a <u>wave</u>, similar to how TVs, radios, and acoustic modems <u>work</u>.  If we accept the idea that all <u>energy</u> moves in <u>cycles</u> and <u>waves</u>, including the <u>energy</u> of <u>ideas</u>, then perhaps those <u>waves</u> are also modulated in some way with <u>information</u>.  As has been suggested earlier, there are <u>waves</u> we either don’t recognize or don’t consider as <u>waves</u>.  For example, is it possible that the “<u>waves</u>” from the “<u>cycles</u>” of the moon or the Arctic Tern could be “modulated” to carry <u>information</u>? It sounds crazy, but we know that <u>brain</u> <u>waves</u> encode <u>information</u> (possibly *rules of behavior*[^141]) as time codes[^142], that light can store quantum memories[^143], and that the same <u>waves</u> we use for communication are the same <u>waves</u> that have filled the entire universe since the <u>Big Bang</u>[^144].  Since the discovery of gravitational <u>waves</u>, we have been looking into how we can transmit <u>information</u> in that medium as well[^145].  Is it possible that these <u>waves</u> are modulated with <u>information</u>, making the <u>waves</u> both the carrier of <u>information</u> as well as the storage medium? Considering how little we know about the Universe, Reality, and Everything, these “crazy” <u>ideas</u> may not be *that* crazy.

Like my grandmother used to say “when you can’t find something, you need to look everywhere.”

## Dark-Matter

One candidate is <u>dark-energy</u>/<u>dark-matter</u>.

Before I describe this idea, I want to make it very clear that I am not a <u>cosmologist</u>, physicist, or scientist of any kind, so this idea may be ridiculously naive and laughable to anyone who is knowledgeable on the subject.  That said, let’s give it a whirl.

Dark <u>energy</u> occupies 70% of the known universe, can’t be directly observed and emits no light or <u>energy</u>.  Dark matter occupies another 25%, and the measly remaining 5% is the matter we can see.  Dark matter can have dark <u>electrons</u> and dark protons and there is even dark chemistry (and maybe dark <u>tholons</u>, like the virtual ones?).  Dark <u>energy</u> also produces dark electromagnetism and dark <u>electricity</u>.  Dark matter does not interact with “regular” matter.  In fact, there are (believed to be) dark galaxies, which is the galaxy of dark <u>energy</u>/matter superimposed on a galaxy of “regular” <u>energy</u>/matter.  In short, everything that exists has a “dark” clone that we can’t detect.  What better medium than dark <u>energy</u> is there that could collect <u>information</u> from every scale of reality?

Dark matter/<u>energy</u> is not just some weird thing we kind of guess is there.  Evidence suggests it actually forms the <u>structure</u> of the entire universe, but all we really know about dark matter is it exists, it exists everywhere, and it interacts with gravity, one of the four fundamental forces of <u>energy</u>.  This then makes gravity the nominee for how the <u>information</u> is transmitted between dark <u>energy</u> and the “regular” <u>energy</u> of our reality.  Perhaps there is some entanglement involved with dark <u>energy</u>, allowing <u>information</u> to travel faster than the <u>speed of light</u>?  

Dark <u>energy</u> is quite elusive, as we can’t detect it or measure it, but we can see its effects in the expanding universe, as dark <u>energy</u> seems to be continually being created (like some sort of dynamic memory system that keeps expanding to accommodate the exponentially increasing storage requirements of an expanding universe?).  Perhaps there is a relationship between extrasensory phenomena and dark matter/<u>energy</u> in some way?

Has anyone tested this? I have scoured the Internet looking for such research and could find nothing.  However, I did run across this very interesting post from one of the senior members of Cambridge University’s Institute of Continuing Education who posted the following:

> Subject: Can quantum dark <u>energy</u> explain telepathy?
>
> Telepathy and quantum entanglement seem to match each other in that a communication connection exists, but no tangible connection.  Could there be a hitherto unknown dark <u>energy</u> particle produced by electrical impulses in the <u>brain</u>? Could it be that entangled particles of this dark <u>energy</u> are shared? If a plasmon circuit in the <u>brain</u> creates <u>patterns</u> of these dark matter particles, based on thoughts and <u>ideas</u>, do people with the shared particles share the same <u>patterns</u> of thoughts and <u>ideas</u>? How long-lived are these particles, how long do they maintain <u>patterns</u>, and what might be the mechanism for transfer? These particles may be exchanged through quantum molecular tunneling, allowing a <u>brain</u> to transmit them outside of the head, and a person with a corollary quantum molecular tunnel for reception to readily receive the particles.  Persons sharing close and personal spaces may be more likely to transfer these particles to each other such as twins, relatives, friends, and even enemies.  It may be that these particles are long-lasting and this may allow objects to be imbued with the dark particle <u>patterns</u>, allowing a sensitive to read a person through the object.  It may be that wherever a transmitter goes the location they were at is imbued with thought <u>patterns</u> of their experiences.  The implications of such a mechanism for telepathy imply this process may be amplified by <u>electronics</u> to increase the strength of transmission and reception.  It also implies that we could control <u>electronics</u> through the use of telepathy.[^146]

[^146]: “**Can Quantum Dark Energy Explain Telepathy?”** Can Quantum Dark Energy Explain Telepathy? \| Naked Science Forum, <https://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=52709.0>

There were no replies.

This may sound like a bit of a stretch, but it’s closer to reality that one might imagine.

In June 2019, University of Portsmouth, U.K, physicist Melvin Vopson published a paper titled "*The <u>information</u> content of the Universe and the implications for the missing Dark Matter*"[^323], wherein he details the "*The mass-energy-information equivalence principle*".  The jist of this theory and principle is that not only is <u>information</u> the 5<sup>th</sup> form of matter, but what scientists have been erroneously referring to Dark Matter *is* this 5<sup>th</sup> form of <u>energy</u>!

[^323]: Vopson, Melvin.  (2019).  **”The information content of the Universe and the implications for the missing Dark Matter."**10.13140/RG.2.2.19933.46560. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333751969_The_information_content_of_the_Universe_and_the_implications_for_the_missing_Dark_Matter

This theory is not mere speculation.  Vopson has performed tests that anyone (with the proper equipment) can replicate.  And what do the tests show?  Information has a tiny,  tiny, amount of <u>mass</u>; 2.91&times;10<sup>-40</sup>Kg/bit, exactly.  Applying that value to the size of DM in the universe results in 2.59&times;10<sup>82</sup> bits of <u>information</u>.  This is quite close to the 10<sup>82</sup> <u>atoms</u> in the Universe as mentioned earlier.

If DM is actually <u>information</u>, the 5<sup>th</sup> form of matter, then certainly this is the most likely candidate for where all this field <u>information</u> of located.

How does this theory fit into the <u>tholonic</u> model? Surprisingly well!

<center><img src="../Images/infos.png" style="width:80%"/></center>

The similarity between the three properties of both are astounding.  You can see the formulas follow Newton’s <u>laws</u>, and, in <u>tholonic</u> fashion, the qualities of &div; define the 2 corners of the CD spectrum, and that of &times; define the CD spectrum itself.  It also aligns such that *<u>mass</u>* in the child of the N-source, implies that <u>mass</u> is the instance of <u>energy</u>, which we know is true.  Why aren’t the values of *<u>energy</u>*, *<u>mass</u>* and *infobit* mapped to the N, D, C corners, but rather to the sides of the <u>tholon</u>? This is the ‘holarchic’ format, rather the the <u>tholonic</u> format, as explained in chapter 7, “Structure”:   

> The primary <u>reason</u> why the properties or <u>movement</u> and <u>energy</u> are the key points in a thologram rather than the instantiated elements, as in the <u>holarchy</u>, is because it is the properties of <u>movement</u> and <u>energy</u> that are consistent at every level of creation. 

*Mass* and  *infobits*, in this case, are more like instances than they are like the flow of <u>energy</u>, at least in relation to the formulas that defined their <u>existence</u>.  Even *<u>energy</u>* can be an instance in this context if we consider it to be an instance of the prime N-source of SAI. In practice, it doesn’t make a big difference which way they are aligned as the same <u>patterns</u> emerge.

The reader has probably noticed that the ***kTln(2)*** equation can be replaced with the ***E*** from ***E=mc<sup>2</sup>***.  What is that equation? It represents the amount of <u>kinetic</u> <u>energy</u> at a certain temperature (the ***kT*** part, the Boltzmann Constant applied to temperature because higher/lower temps means higher/lower <u>kinetic</u> <u>energy</u>) and the ***ln(2)*** represents the exponential growth or decay over time (remember from chapter 8, “Instances”, that ***ln(x)*** allows you to **plug in growth/decay and get the time** it would take to reach amount *x*).  In short ***kTln(2)*** is another way to say E for a specific context (of time and temperature).

Related, in some way, is the fact that <u>information</u> is carried in the magnetic part of the electromagnetic field, and that the magnetic field only exists if there is <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>.  If infobits have <u>energy</u> and <u>mass</u>, according to Vobson, and <u>information</u> is <u>data</u>+<u>energy</u>, according to the <u>tholonic</u> model, then <u>information</u> *must* create some kind of field.  Can infobits be induced with such a field, like how a magnetic field can create <u>movement</u> of electric charges via induction?  

This idea that <u>information</u> has <u>mass</u> is also in line with the <u>concept</u> that <u>energy</u> alone is undetectable, unusable, and meaningless if it does not interact with some *thing*, even if that thing is itself (such as <u>mass</u> as <u>energy</u>).  Information, being <u>data</u>+<u>energy</u>, is a form of <u>energy</u>.  If <u>information</u> has no interaction with some *thing* than it is undetectable.  Is the tiny <u>mass</u> that <u>information</u> has the *thing* that allows to exist in to be perceived?  The ultimate question is, if <u>information</u> has <u>mass</u>, and <u>information</u> is growing exponentially, then at some point, due to the conservation of <u>energy</u>, the Universe will be nothing but <u>information</u>.  Vobson believe this concern has some weight (literally) as he predicts an <u>information</u> catastrophe in about 350 years when the <u>number</u> of bits of <u>information</u> exceed the <u>atoms</u> of Earth, which is around 10<sup>50</sup>, and the power to sustain those bits will be 15.5&times;10<sup>15</sup> <u>watts</u>, more than the total <u>planetary</u> power available today.  In 500 years, <u>information</u> will account for half of the world’s weight.[^328]

## Gravity

Roger Penrose also suggests that quantum gravity and how it relates to *quantum state reduction*, or the collapsing of a <u>waveform</u>, i.e. the instantiation of a <u>tholon</u>, is the source of <u>consciousness</u>[^147].  If the <u>tholonic</u> idea that <u>awareness</u> is the source of <u>existence</u>, then this suggests that <u>consciousness</u> is not only the byproduct of <u>awareness</u>, which makes perfect sense, but it is also a integral part of the instantiation of <u>tholonic</u> <u>patterns</u> as <u>consciousness</u> serves as the expression of <u>awareness</u> necessary to complete the instantiation process.

[^147]: Atmanspacher, Harald. “**Quantum Approaches to Consciousness.**” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Stanford University, November 5, 2019. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#PenrHameQuanGravMicr. Section 3.5

Geometrically speaking, while the infinitely expanding self-similar trigram is a result of the primary three states created by SAI, as previously shown, for it to instantiate into a 3D <u>tholon</u> it requires the 4<sup>th</sup> composite *white dot* to collapse into the tetrahedral thologram. Consciousness is an instance of <u>awareness</u>, and as such is composed of all three primary dots, e.g., subjective <u>awareness</u>, objective <u>awareness</u>, and the <u>awareness</u> of where they meet, or if you prefer, the <u>awareness</u> of *all*, *all that is possible*, and *all that is*.  In the subatomic context, it instantiates as quantum gravity, which is the <u>force</u> that collapses the <u>wave</u> functions.  This suggests that <u>consciousness</u> and gravity are two instances of the same <u>pattern</u> or <u>tholon</u> within two different contexts.  

This would also suggest that in the world of <u>subatomic particles</u> where we have the basic trinity of <u>electrons</u>, protons, and neutrons, we would also expect to find a 4<sup>th</sup> particle that represents gravity, a *graviton*, and in fact, <u>science</u> has speculated that such a particle exists, they just haven’t found it yet.  

All of this is simply to suggest that if gravity is fundamental to <u>consciousness</u> and <u>existence</u>, then so too are their fields.  But gravity itself is a field.  And what is the source of that field?  Mass.  And what is the source of <u>mass</u>? SAI.  If we accept the alternative theory of the <u>Big Bang</u> that <u>mass</u> was created by the infinite gravity of the 0-dimensional <u>singularity</u>, then gravity my be the first instance of SAI.

Considering gravity (and <u>awareness</u>) is both mass-less and infinite yet binds the entire universe together, it seems like an excellent candidate for exploring field memory.

Is there any evidence to suggest that gravity and <u>consciousness</u> are two instances of the same expressions in different scopes? Yes, there is.

Let’s  look at another one of Newton’s formulas that describes the gravitational <u>force</u>: <IMG src="../Images/<u>math</u>/160.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:12pt;"/> , where *F* is the gravitational <u>force</u> in <u>newtons</u>, *g* is the gravitational field as it applies to two different masses, and *S* is the separation between those two masses.  And yes, it also looks just like the Ohm’s Law for *<u>resistance</u>* <IMG src="../Images/<u>math</u>/161.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:12pt;"/>, which also suggests that <u>consciousness</u>, gravity, and <u>resistance</u> are the same <u>archetype</u> instantiated across three different scopes. 

If we do the <u>math</u>, we see all of Newton’s formulas <u>work</u> out correctly for gravity, but, with one mystery value for  G, the gravitational constant.

- **g &rarr;P**:  The **gravitational field of <u>mass</u>** equates to **power**, transference of <u>energy</u> over time.
- **F&rarr;R**: The **<u>force</u> of gravity** equates to **<u>resistance</u>**.  This value is the speed at which things fall, so 9.87 m/s<sup>2</sup> here on Earth.
- <img src="../Images/gmm.png" style="float:right;width:20%"/>**S&rarr;I**: The the distance between *observer* and *observed* equates to **current**, or the strength of energy.  As the distance lessens, the force increases, as **S** and **F** are inversely proportional.  *Note:  The terms observer and observed are the actual technical terms used, and not terms used here to add validity to the tholonic theory that reality itself emerged from the primal observer, the 0-dimensional concept of SAI, and the observed, the first creation of the SAI.*
- **G&rarr;V**: The **gravitational constant**, which is measured in <u>newtons</u>, equates to **<u>volts</u>**, or the pressure of <u>energy</u> that is inherent in all <u>mass</u> in the form of gravity.  However, the value arrived at by the calculations is 62,772,597.14, while the GC is measured as 6.67×10<sup>−11</sup>.  That is a bit off, by a factor of 9.41&times;10<sup>17</sup> to be exact.  The only real difference between these two values is the units of measure.  The GC value is *<u>newtons</u>&times;meters<sup>2</sup>&div;kilograms<sup>2</sup>*, but this calculated value is obviously using much smaller, yet unknown units… perhaps something related to *Planck’s <u>force</u>&times;Planck’s length<sup>2</sup>&times;Planck’s <u>mass</u><sup>2</sup>*  ?

There is another correlation as well.  The limits of an electrical circuit are defined by the amount of charge, or current (amps), that is allowed to pass through a system at any given moment.  This is controlled by a fuse.  In the *E=mc<sup>2</sup>* equivalency we saw previously, it is *c*, the <u>speed of light</u>, that defines the limits of the system we call the Universe, but unlike amps, *c* can never change.  Here, in the gravity example, the defining <u>limitation</u> of the system is *S*, the distance between two fields.  So . let’s replace ***I*** (or *c)* with ***S*** and see if there is a reasonable correlation between gravity and <u>consciousness</u> when applied to Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> and <u>tholons</u>?

For example: 

<img src="../Images/gr-consc.png" style="float:right;width:50%"/>**Separation (S)**: The separation in the context of consciousness is the first separation, that of subjective (observer) and objective (observed), so we will correlate the separation of the 2 masses with these two perspectives.

**Awareness (A)**:  The initial blue dot, the N-source, of the <u>tholonic</u> trigram is the first instance of <u>awareness</u>, and also correlates to *<u>force</u>*, *<u>potential</u>*, or *<u>volts</u>*, so we will correlate the gravitational constant to the N-source and the first state of <u>awareness</u>.

**Consciousness (C)**: As we mentioned before, what we are calling <u>consciousness</u> is an instance of <u>awareness</u>, more specifically, an instance of the <u>awareness</u> of a <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetype</u>.  This firmly places <u>consciousness</u> in the position of the child N-source, which correlates with electrical *power* (P) and the gravitational field (*g*).  This <u>concept</u> emerged in the spectrum of separation and matter, which are the instances of the primal <u>concepts</u> of *<u>nothingness</u>* and *<u>somethingness</u>*.

**Mass (M)**: We are left to correlate electrical <u>resistance</u> with the <u>force</u> of the gravitational field for a specific <u>mass</u>.  This fits, especially when we realize that it is the limiting and defining qualities of this <u>force</u> which holds everything in the universe together and in their place.  Mass is the source of gravity, or, if we accept the theory that it was the infinite gravity of the <u>singularity</u> that created <u>mass</u>, then <u>mass</u> is an instance of gravity.  

All-in-all, this shows that <u>consciousness</u> is an instance of <u>awareness</u> in the context of <u>somethingness</u> (<u>mass</u>) and <u>nothingness</u> (separation).

For the question at hand, what this means is that if there is such as thing as a universal data-store of all the instances of Awareness, then we will find clues to its <u>existence</u> in the instances of <u>consciousness</u> and <u>mass</u>, in the differences between those instances, and how they relate to one another within the <u>unity</u> of Awareness.  

This attempt to quantify <u>consciousness</u> and <u>awareness</u> may sound very esoteric or even seem ridiculous to some, but more and more evidence suggests that <u>consciousness</u> is a <u>force</u> of <u>nature</u>, and as such, has quantifiable properties.

An example of directly applicable evidence comes from an article written by theoretical quantum physicist Swati Nigam entitled *Gravity As Conscious Force To Resolve Quantum Gravity*[^148], wherein she states:

[^148]: Swati Nigam , “**Gravity As Conscious Force To Resolve Quantum Gravity.**” Physics Foundations, July 31, 2017. DOI: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5234617.v1 Published in https://physicsfoundationsblog.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/gravity-as-conscious-force-to-resolve-quantum-gravity/; Downloadable PDF available at https://www.academia.edu/33993443/GRAVITY_AS_CONSCIOUS_FORCE_TO_RESOLVE_QUANTUM_GRAVITY

> According to current <u>science</u>, there is a missing connection between general relativity and <u>quantum mechanics</u> <u>concepts</u> of physics, which is needed to unify them into one, to <u>conceptualize</u> a unified field theory.

The article then goes on about the <u>nature</u> of the problem, ultimately concluding that <u>consciousness</u> itself is an additional <u>force</u> to the 4 forces of the Standard Model, a 5<sup>th</sup> <u>force</u>, and one that solves the challenges of the unified field theory in its attempt to unify general relativity with <u>quantum mechanics</u>.  Dr. Nigam goes on to say:

> Thus, we can use the term “conscious <u>force</u>” for gravitational <u>force</u>&hellip;.  ***Conscious <u>force</u>* is gravitational <u>force</u>** which is the unidentified fifth <u>force</u>.  This <u>force</u> is a synonym for gravitational <u>force</u>, works just like it on all matter entities, irrespective of their <u>nature</u> or position in space, both in macro or micro worlds.

If Awareness and its instances of <u>consciousness</u> is a fundamental <u>force</u>, then it has a field, and that field might hold clues to *field memory*, perhaps similar to the way the memory in the <u>brain</u> might be a *<u>neuronal</u> activity-associated magnetic field*? [^149]<sup>,</sup>[^150] In any case, there seems to be a strong correlation between <u>consciousness</u>, gravity, dark matter, and <u>information</u>.

## Limits of Consciousness?

This idea that there might be a relationship between <u>consciousness</u> and gravity raises another question, and that is, if observation is required to collapse a <u>wave</u> function, then can we define <u>consciousness</u> as that which has the ability to observe?

First, let’s hear what Werner Heisenberg has to say about what *observation* means

> Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of <u>nature</u>.  The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and *it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being*; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the “possible” to the “actual”, is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory.  **\~Werner Heisenberg, *Physics and Philosophy*, p.  137**

And by “registering decisions” he means any sort of recording of effect that is the result of interacting with the cause, as long as that recording is a time-irreversible process.  It is this recording that separates *all that is possible* from *all that is*, or the *Definition* from the *Contribution*. This would imply that if one <u>atom</u> was altered as a result of  interacting with the <u>wave</u> function, it will collapse into a particle, so even a rock could be an “observer”.  It turns out that the act of observation is more analog than digital, meaning, the more something is observed, the more effect it has.  In a recent experiment[^151] it was shown that:

[^151]: Weizmann Institute Of Science. "**Quantum Theory Demonstrated: Observation Affects Reality.**" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 27 February 1998. <www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/02/980227055013.htm>

> …the greater the amount of “watching”, the greater the observer’s influence on what actually takes place.

So, a rock might be able to “observe”, but perhaps its observation would be too weak to have much of an effect on reality.  The experimenters built a machine with variable observation strength levels, but it would be very interesting to measure the observational strength levels of different forms of instances.  Are there stronger *observational powers* then what we <u>humans</u> have? This is unknown (I think), but what is known is that machines alone have enough observational power to collapse a <u>wave</u>[^155].

[^155]: Pritchard, David E., et al. “**Photon Scattering from Atoms in an Atom Interferometer: Coherence Lost and Regained.**” Coherence and Quantum Optics VII, 1996, pp. 133-141. doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-9742-8_18. <https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.3783> Full paper: <http://chapmanlabs.gatech.edu/papers/scattering_ifm_prl95.pdf>.

With this in mind, it might be useful to think of <u>awareness</u> as a <u>wave</u> function, a sea of “possibilities”, but <u>consciousness</u> as the “actual” instance of a collapsing <u>wave</u> of <u>awareness</u>.  This would support the idea that everything that exists potentially has a <u>consciousness</u>, but weak “observations” will produce weak <u>wave</u> function collapses, a weak instantiation of <u>consciousness</u>.  It would also suggest that the most “observation” that has ever taken place was at the moment of the <u>Big Bang</u>, when everything was “observed” by everything in the 1 trillion degree ball of super-plasma, and over time, observation decreases until no thing can “observe” anything else (that is, if the universe continues to only expand).  In this way, the universe’s ability to “observe” acts like entropy; the lower the entropy of the universe, the more it could “observe”.  As entropy increases, the less it “observes”, until it becomes completely “blind”.  If nothing is observed, nothing collapses.  Like the tree that collapsed in the woods, if no one hears it, it is irrelevant whether it made any sound or not.  When nothing can be observed, everything is just a <u>wave</u> function of <u>potential</u>.  Perhaps  the Zen-like fate of the universe is not the <u>Big Crunch</u> or <u>Big Freeze</u>, or Big anything&hellip; it just becomes irrelevant.

## Structured Memory

Another possibility is <u>structure</u> itself.  It has been claimed that the <u>structure</u> of water can hold memory.  Although this claim has not been sufficiently tested by any means, there is at least some evidence to suggest it might be valid.  Dr.  Emoto has been the most public in his claims that water holds memory, and presents many examples and theories, but none of his <u>work</u> has been thoroughly tested by scientific standards. (*Note: At one point I felt it was necessary to subject his tests to scientific study, but I have come to understand that such testing will guarantee unsuccessful results regardless of the the validity of his experiments due to the <u>nature</u> of <u>science</u> as we currently understand it*).

There is quite a lot of <u>information</u> available about Emoto’s <u>work</u> so I will not repeat any of it here.  However, Dr. Dean Radin, who has an impressive list of honors and a history of serious scientific <u>work</u>, did perform a “*Double-Blind Test of the Effects of Distant Intention on Water Crystal Formation*”[^307] and reported very significant results (P=0.001).  Dr. Radin has published a <u>number</u> of similar studies.

Speaking only for myself, one of the more compelling pieces of evidence I have seen comes from the experiment where 4 students created 4 drops of water, all from the same source.  The image above shows the results of that experiment where each set of 4 drops was created by a different student.  

This experiment was performed by Dr. Brend Kröplin and his team, which makes the results all the more valid, as Dr. Kröplin not only received his Ph.D. in the hard sciences (his thesis was on the elastoplastic stability of steel bridges), but he was also dean of the *Institute for Statics and Dynamics of Aerospace Structures* of the University of Stuttgart as well as the winner of the Körber European Science Prize, which resulted in a 1.5 million deutschmark contract to produce high altitude (20km) communication equipment.  This puts him very high on the “trusted sources” list.

Even if this is not bulletproof evidence (similar to the <u>existence</u> of Australia for anyone who has never been there), it is enough to raise the question.  In addition, this test was also conducted using different types of flowers, and, according to the testers, the resulting <u>patterns</u> in the drops of water resembled the <u>patterns</u> of the flower.  Tholonically, this is exactly what we would expect to see, as it is <u>patterns</u> of <u>energy</u> that create the instance of the flower.

Another source that supports the idea of water holding <u>information</u> is Jacques Benveniste, a French immunologist who worked at the Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in 1988, who published a paper in *Nature* concluding that the configuration of <u>molecules</u> in water was biologically active even in the absence of the elements that caused that configuration.  This “water memory” was immediately picked up by the homeopathic community as proof of its efficacy, even though it did not really apply to homeopathy.

While Emoto’s <u>work</u> can easily be brushed off by skeptics and institutional authorities due to its lack of rigorous analysis, Benveniste’s <u>work</u> could not.

*Nature* magazine editor, Jim Maddox (yes, the same person who promoted the burning of Sheldrake’s book on the grounds of heresy, as well as claiming the <u>Big Bang</u> theory is “philosophically unacceptable” and that there was “no need to panic about AIDS”), prefaced the *Nature* article with an editorial comment entitled “When to believe the unbelievable”, which admitted: “There is no objective explanation of these observations”. That sounds like a begrudging admission, but it was more like a temporary retreat in preparation for the next offensive.

*Nature* did not want to publish the paper to begin with, holding its release for two years while awaiting independent confirmation from impartial laboratories in Israel, Italy, and Canada, who reported an observable biological effect.[^152]

[^152]: Thomas Y., Kahhak L., Aissa J. (2006) **The physical nature of the biological signal, a puzzling phenomenon: the critical contribution of Jacques Benveniste**. In: Pollack G.H., Cameron I.L., Wheatley D.N. (eds) Water and the Cell. Springer, Dordrecht, <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-4927-7_17>

After the paper was published there was an explosion of meltdowns from the scientific community.  In response, *Nature* demanded that the experiment be repeated under conditions controlled by an ad-hoc selected team of its own, which included (and this should shed some light on their not-so-hidden intentions) the famous illusionist, pseudo-science enemy, and occasionally dishonest, James Randi, plus Maddox himself and a malpractice investigator.

The *Nature* team did, in fact, find the same results as Benveniste, but with one fascinating exception: the effects of the tests disappeared when the members of the laboratory did not know if the water sample had been treated or not.  One could claim the results were then biased based on this <u>knowledge</u>, but this would presume these hand-picked independent researchers were secretly fudging the <u>data</u>.  If they were not, then the implication is that simply the <u>awareness</u> of the state of the water samples was enough to affect the test results.  According to the <u>tholonic</u> model, being aware of something is sufficient to instantiate it to *some* degree, like a <u>tholonic</u> version of *observational powers*.  In any case, this was sufficient for *Nature* to publish a report on this methodological flaw in Benveniste’s experiments and officially called “water memory” pseudo-science[^153] and published an article calling the entire idea “delusional” (written by, of course, Maddox, Randi, and Stewart, another lover of dogma)[^154].  Case closed.

[^153]: “**When to Publish Pseudo-Science**.” Nature, vol. 334, no. 6181, 1988, pp. 367. doi:10.1038/334367a0. <https://www.nature.com/articles/334367a0>

Or so they hoped, for not long after Benveniste’s paper, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) decided to take their own look into his <u>work</u>.  In their words:

> These <u>data</u> seem particularly important because they further enrich the immense achievements of molecular <u>biology</u>.  They also suggest the development of new modes of transmission of genetic messages (transmission, transduction, teleportation, etc.).

Fortunately, they did not invite Maddox or Randi to be a speaker.  Rather, they invited the Nobel Prize-winning discoverer of HIV, Luc Montagnier, who, much to the skeptic’s dismay, stunned many fellow scientists years earlier with claims that <u>DNA</u> emits weak electromagnetic <u>waves</u> that cause structural changes in water that persist even in extremely high dilutions&hellip; which is not exactly water-memory, but very close.  Montagnier has gone on to say that “*More scientists are becoming convinced [of water-memory] by the <u>data</u>*” as new evidence appears.

OK, that was a long-winded bit of history there, but it shows the <u>resistance</u> to new <u>ideas</u> as well as the real possibility that water-memory exists.

But I am not a scientist, so I don’t have to worry about what the editors at *Nature* or what dubious debunkers think, so I can hypothesize the following: If the <u>structure</u> of water can hold memory, does this mean that the <u>structure</u> of other things can also hold memory? Can the thologram itself hold memory in its mega-meta-structure? If we claim that the <u>structure</u> of our material world is but an instance of that <u>structure</u> in the thologram, then we would have to say “yes”, and that then opens the door to the <u>ideas</u> that all <u>structure</u>, in every corner of the universe, might be a memory store.  Perhaps certain <u>structures</u> are better suited to hold certain types of memory? More exciting is the possibility that the mechanism to access this memory, and the <u>knowledge</u>, is to simply become aware of it.  This last part is trickier than it sounds, as we don’t know what we don’t know, so how do we know what to become aware of?

Regardless of the theory, whatever it happens to be, the morphic or <u>tholonic</u> field would have to be something like an electromagnetic field in a different context, as both are caused by the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>.

#### **Key 65:** Everything that exists due to the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> has a field that has its origins in SAI.  This field is the foundation of <u>consciousness</u> and <u>knowledge</u>.



The redundant and self-similar expressions of <u>energy</u> can be seen in the ever more complex and integrated <u>patterns</u> that have evolved since all of creation began as an infinitesimally small <u>singularity</u> of infinite gravity, <u>zero</u> time, and total <u>mass</u> that was the <u>seed</u> of this Universe.

By the same token, the redundant and self-similar expressions of <u>awareness</u> can be seen in the ever more complex and integrated <u>patterns</u> that have evolved since all of creation began as a 0-dimensional dot whose only property was SAI.

The claim that <u>energy</u> itself is a fundamental form of SAI implies that everything that exists is also a form of SAI in the same way that everything that exists is a form of <u>energy</u>.  To be aware of something is to direct <u>energy</u> to some <u>concept</u> or idea, thereby moving <u>energy</u> through that <u>pattern</u> and the <u>Bell curve</u> of that <u>archetype</u>, which alters the *norm* of what and how that <u>archetype</u> will instantiate itself.

From the <u>tholonic</u> perspective, if the claim is “<u>energy</u> alone can’t be observed; only its interactions with other forms of <u>energy</u> (<u>mass</u>) can” is true, then it is also true that “<u>awareness</u> alone can’t be observed; only its interactions with other forms of <u>awareness</u> can”.

> “Consciousness [ed: or <u>awareness</u> from the <u>tholonic</u> perspective] is part of our universe, so any physical theory which makes no proper place for it falls fundamentally short of providing a genuine description of the world.”[^156]  **\~Roger Penrose**

Tholonic-fields exist in the realm of thought, <u>ideas</u>, and <u>concepts</u>, so any experiments that might be run probably need to be thought-based in <u>nature</u>.  Is there any evidence that thoughts can directly alter our material reality? If the answer is yes, that might support the idea that altering <u>archetypes</u> in the realm of <u>ideas</u> has a measurable effect on the instance of those <u>archetypes</u>, i.e.  reality as we know it.  Chapter 11, “*Application of Awareness*”, looks at some of these experiments.

## Reality

What about the possibility that reality itself, the world around us, matter, everything we consider to be real, *is* the memory?  

*Note: This is very related to the <u>information</u>/Dark Matter section above*

This idea is based on the idea of Quantum Darwinism[^157] that states that of all the probable states that can exist, the ones that survive do so because of support from their environment.  In turn, these states that survive transfer <u>information</u> to the environment, altering its context, shifting the curve in its favor, and thereby improving the probabilities of future similar states.

[^157]: Dr. Wojciech Zurek of the Los Alamos National Laboratory explains the concept of quantum Darwinism in an interview at the Institute for Quantum Computing that you can see on YouTube at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27zMdaBgt6g>

As the <u>energy</u> interacts with the environment around it, the range of probabilities for the many attributes of an <u>energy</u> particle begins to decohere, or disappear, leaving only the attributes that are most compatible with the environment, which then interacts with the environment to make the environment more compatible with the attributes.  Notice the compatibility of Quantum Darwinism with the descriptions of the social equations in the section “The Meaning of Math” in chapter 8, “*Instances*”, and how quantum Darwinism is a perfect example of context&rightarrow;content &rightarrow;context&rightarrow;etc.

Reality, as we know it, is the consequence of this processes of *decohering* the less successful possibilities of a particle’s superposition.  In the end, one set of attributes dominates, and that is what we see in the reality that surrounds us.  In other words, reality itself is the living record of what worked and works.uber

Applied to the <u>tholonic</u> model, each <u>tholon</u> has a set of stable properties, and given its self-similar <u>structure</u>, each <u>tholon</u> only needs to manage the properties that relate to its <u>scope</u> or that exist within its spectrum, leaving the parent properties to the parents, and any of the child properties to the child.  Each <u>tholon</u> then “knows” what works and expresses this in the instances of that <u>tholon</u>, which is every archetypal idea and form that has the possibility to exist.  When we look at a thing, like a rock, we are not just seeing the <u>evolutionary</u> results of the <u>tholon</u> of a rock, but also the <u>aggregated</u> results of all related <u>tholons</u>; mountain, <u>planet</u>, solar system, galaxy, silica, <u>molecules</u>, <u>atoms</u>, <u>electrons</u>, etc.

<center><img src='../Images/realtholons.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

The <u>language</u> of reality begins with one “letter” (a <u>tholon</u>) of the alphabet, which becomes three in the next generations, which becomes 12, etc.  Each of these letters is a record of what “works.”

Remember that phrase *<u>combinatorial inflation</u>* which describes the exponentially increasing <u>number</u> of possibilities in <u>protein</u> production? This is the big problem with current <u>evolutionary</u> thought, as there are simply too many combinations for <u>nature</u> to try.

In the <u>tholonic</u> model, these massively inflated possibilities are much simpler to navigate.  We start with a duality within which a stable <u>pattern</u> emerges.  From that stable <u>pattern</u>, a new duality emerges, which produces another stable <u>pattern</u>.  For each generation, we have three new possible <u>tholons</u> from which <u>patterns</u> can emerge.  Only stable <u>patterns</u> are capable of creating dualities, so unsustainable <u>patterns</u> never propagate.  After a mere 129 generations of this process we have produced 10<sup>77</sup> possible <u>tholonic</u> paths or combinations, but at each generation we only needed to create one pair of parameters (we used 10<sup>77</sup> as that was the possible <u>number</u> of <u>protein</u> combinations with just twenty <u>amino acids</u> and 150 proteins&hellip; a very, very small <u>number</u> when compared to the actual proteins that make up <u>life</u>).

It is clear that the odds are incredibly stacked against a new form of a viable <u>protein</u> to appear because the assumption is the entire field of 10<sup>77</sup> is available.  Tholonically, the entire field available is limited to a mere three properties, but these properties are self-similarly embedded in every succeeding generation.  If a new <u>pattern</u> emerged somewhere around the 63<sup>rd</sup> generation (10<sup>37</sup> combinations), then an entire new branch of creation will emerge at a point in the tree where it will have a significant presence at the 129<sup>th</sup> generation.  This would explain the Cambrian Explosion when 541 million years ago a major new class of <u>life</u> appeared that was the origin of all modern marine <u>life</u>.  It also destroys the Darwinian model of long-term <u>evolution</u>.  Ironically, Darwin himself, in his *Origin of Species*, said this nasty detail was the main argument against his “Theory of Descent”.

Here’s a simple mathematical example.

First, let’s look at the <u>Bell curve</u> again.  Let’s say you do 32-coin flips 50,000 times and plot the results.

The peak of the <u>Bell curve</u> is going to tell us what the most likely result will be, which is, that we will get heads 16 out of 32 flips, on average.  But we have decided we are going to run this test five times, but each subsequent time we are only going to use the coins that came up heads in the previous test.  If we do this same process five times, we end up with the following:

- Test 1 with 32 coins, 16 came up heads
- Test 2 with 16 coins, 8 came up heads
- Test 3 with 8 coins, 4 came up heads
- Test 4 with 4 coins, 2 came up heads
- Test 5 with 2 coins, 1 came up heads

<center><img src='../Images/101-toincoss.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

If we plotted the results, we would end up with a <u>Bell curve</u> that looked something like this “Number of Heads” graph.

So, when we run these five tests 50,000 times each, the chances of us ending up with 1 coin from 32 coins is obviously 100%.

Now imagine we use different coins for each test;

- Test 1, 32 quarters
- Test 2, 16 nickels
- Test 3, 8 dimes
- Test 4, 4 half-dollars
- Test 5, 2 pennies.

We start out with 62 coins  (32 quarters, 16 nickels, 8 dimes, 4 half-dollars, and 2 pennies) but end up with 31 coins (16 quarters, 8 nickels, 4 dimes, 2 half-dollars, and 1 penny).

If an observer was blind to the process and only knew that the final result was one penny, but that you started out with 62 coins, they would say there is a 2:62, or 3.2%, chance of you ending up with a penny, when, in fact, you know there is a 100% chance of you ending up with a penny.  That’s 96.8% margin of error vs. 0% margin of error. 

The observer, in an attempt to replicate your success, but not knowing your process, will begin to run tests and keep notes as to what worked and what didn’t <u>work</u>.  He checks these notes every time he runs a new test to make sure he is not doing something that has been shown to fail.  Once he discovers your process, he can archive the failed notes and simply describe the process that works.  He does not need to record all the failures once he has discovered the process that works, but he does so as to pass them on to the next generation of researchers who will approach similar problems in the same bottom-up fashion.

Existence does not need to record its failures as it is the ultimate top-down approach, from the <u>tholonic</u> perspective.  From the very first instance of creation, nothing progressed unless the previous process worked, i.e.  new child <u>tholons</u> created from the stable <u>patterns</u> of the parent <u>tholon</u>.  No reverse engineering is necessary for <u>existence</u> as it is an exclusively forward-engineering process.  If a branch of <u>existence</u> fails it will only fail up to the last successful parent.  This is like saying that if all your nickels were swapped out for double-tailed nickels, then all flips after the nickels would come up as <u>zero</u>, killing the entire branch below nickels and preventing any opportunity for the dimes, half-dollars and pennies.  The quarters are still fine, and because you want the tests to continue to <u>work</u> properly, you would need to get new nickels in <u>order</u> to fix the problem.

In our example here, the flipping is analogous to the <u>energy</u> within a <u>tholon</u> creating stable <u>patterns</u> and the experimenter is analogous to the <u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u>, which includes the <u>intelligence</u> that “fixes” the problem when he received feedback from the broken branch (i.e. bad nickels) that modified the curve (skewed results) which resulted in a new stable <u>pattern</u> (good nickels).  (I know this example sounds ridiculously trivial, but it’s the simplest example I could think of.)

From the <u>tholons</u> view, the experimenter and the experiment are a an integral part of the <u>tholonic</u> expression, so the analogy is not only an analogy, but also an instance of the <u>tholonic</u> process.

<img src='../Images/102-tpaths.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>A simple example more aligned to the tholonic model would be how N-states emerge along the Bell curves from which N-sources create new trigrams.  In the image on the right,  this same idea is shown using a Fourier Series of hierarchical circles.  By assigning a value for points on the spectrum, and a binary value representing the generation of the trigram, we can create a unique value for every point that identifies its place on the spectrum and its level.  If we combine each of these numbers, we can create one value for the entire lineage that has an extractable record of the chain of tholons and their spectrum’s value at every level.  This one number would then act as a memory of all the ancestors.  We can see this easily in simple binary math.  If we have 5 generations of numbers that double with each generation, such as 1,2,4,8,16, and we have the number 22 representing the sum of all the contributing generations, we can easily determine that only the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> generations contributed, because only 2, 4, and 16 can create 22.  The tholons are similar in that each tholon has a fingerprint that is encoded in every one of its descendants that describes its path from the original source.

What this means is that everything that exists is *already* a record of what works from the first moment of creation, through every generation, up to and including the thing that exists.  Life, Reality, and Everything *is* the warehouse of all <u>knowledge</u>.  We just haven’t yet figured out how to decode (most of) it. We demonstrated an example of the binary qualities of <u>tholonic</u> counting earlier, and *Appendix G*, “*The Tholonic I-Ching*”, specifically addresses this and shows exactly how each <u>tholon</u> has a naturally existing binary signature.  It may actually be the case that a thing itself ***is*** the value of that <u>tholon</u>.  We think of <u>numbers</u> as digits, but in some unfathomably complex and multidimensional reality, perhaps the cumulative value of that plant is expressed not as <u>numbers</u>, but as the plant itself, which we can only perceive as a simple plant over time in our 3D world.

### Hidden Data
<img src='../Images/wavetypes2.png' style='float:right;width:15%'/>This is similar in concept to the way a piece of music is the combination of many *atoms* of sound (yes, that’s a real thing, and it’s about 0.093 seconds[^158]), each an aggregate of many individual frequencies.  Over time, these frequencies change, resulting in “music” because we have the abilities to “decode” those frequencies, thanks to the cooperative functions of our auditory cortex, cerebrum, cerebellum, and limbic system.  We can also decode waves using such concepts as the Fourier Transform which allow us to  discover all of a waves components, but that does not mean we can recognize what information is contained in that wave.  For example, there can be images encoded in frequencies that no analysis will discover unless we know what to look for, such as the image on Barack Obama encoded into sound (Image right. For more examples, see *Appendix E*, “*Hidden Images*”)

[^158]: “**How Large Is an Atom of Music? A Tour through Today's Spectral Music and Software at UCSD.**” *Rhizome.org*, 27 Apr. 2011, classic.rhizome.org/editorial/2011/apr/27/how-large-atom-music-tour-through-todays-spectral-/.

<img src="../Images/elvis.png" style="float:right;width:30%"/>Another example of this that demonstrates some very tholonic concepts is a photo-mosaic, which is an image that is made up of other images, such as this image of Elvis that is made up of many images of Elvis.  Now, imagine an image made up of many images which are made up of many images, and so on, but instead of the patterns being that of an image, imagine the patterns as that of energy and awareness, with each image having its own intelligence and intention.  While almost any collection of images can be used to create any other type of image, this is far less so the case when we are speaking of tholons, which are effectively living expressions of energy, intention, intelligence, and awareness.  There are many more dimensions and constraints, such as the law of entropy, so some tholons will be more likely to form other tholons depending on the “benefits”,  such as conserving energy or enhancing adaptation, to both the defining and contributing tholons.

Just for fun, here is the human eye made only from images used in this book, and a bull skull in Death Valley made with blooming flowers.

### Brownian Archetypes

These images are meant to demonstrate how <u>information</u> can be composed of <u>information</u>, and how any one piece of <u>information</u> is both composed of smaller pieces and is part of a larger piece.  So, how can we even begin to decode such <u>information</u>?  One thing we can do is look at how <u>information</u> “progresses”.  The multiple generations of embedded images, or <u>tholons</u>, or <u>fractal</u> <u>patterns</u>, represent unique paths, or lineages, that start from one point but end up at many points.  The progression of these lineages are not predictable, but are not random.  They are the result of expanding <u>energy</u> moving forward in time, diverging from one <u>archetype</u> and <u>converging</u> toward others, not unlike Brownian <u>movement</u> (examples shown below).

<center><img src='../Images/brownian.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This suspicion is based on the fact that Brownian and Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) is an <u>archetype</u> for, and can describe,  rivers [^352]<sup>,</sup>[^353], trees[^354], <u>neurology</u>[^355], landscapes, and appears to be fundamental to all organic growth.

In all cases, the paths of growth will be determined by the basic rules of:

- All <u>movement</u> will always seek the path of least <u>resistance</u>.

- Paths of least <u>resistance</u> will form <u>patterns</u>.

- Patterns form <u>archetypes</u>.

- Energy (<u>movement</u>) is always diverging *from* one <u>archetype</u> *towards* another <u>archetype</u>.

- All <u>movement</u> is a an expression of <u>energy</u> seeking a <u>balance</u>.

There is much more to the significance of Brownian mechanics, at least from the <u>tholonic</u> view, but this reasoning is well outside the acceptable limits of scientific thinking.  The reader can decide whether the following its worthy of consideration. 

The “jitters” in Brownian motion are caused by external forces.  For physical things, like amoebas and pollen, this can be collisions with other particles.  For things like <u>information</u>, this can be “<u>noise</u>”, such as the small  transactions of buying and selling when looking at the <u>stock market</u> as a whole.  In general, the larger the object, the less effect these smaller influences have.  A falling spec of dust will have Brownian <u>movement</u>, but a falling rock will not.  A huge move in the market will be unaffected by small transactions.  This same <u>concept</u> applies to <u>energy</u> fields, such as <u>electricity</u> or radio <u>waves</u>, and we see examples of external forces affecting these fields in electromagnetic <u>interference</u> of solar flares, auroras, or ignition systems.

<img src='../Images/interference.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>This last reference will be obscure to the under-50 readers, but once upon a time, if you had your radio on in your house and a car drove by with a poorly insulated ignition system, (very common in the 60s) you could hear the ignition system sending pulses to the spark plugs as clicks.  Without even seeing the car, you could know how fast they were going, *if* that had an automatic transmission.  If they had a manual transmission, and you could see how fast the car was moving, you could know if they were going too fast for 2<sup>rd</sup> gear or too slow for 3<sup>rd</sup>, thereby discovering that Mrs. Brown, the 2<sup>nd</sup> grade school teacher, was a far better driver than the Police Chief, who also owner a slaughter house.  This inside information was simply due to this annoying “noise” of field interference.  Were I a mechanic, I could have used this data to do some pre-digital, data-mined, targeted sales. Today, we can hear a distant person’s voice by the interference of light and sound waves bouncing off a box of nearby box of tissues.  In the same manner, we can learn learn things about the sun based on how solar flares disturb television transmissions.

If someone was aware of how fields interfere with each other, and they happened to be watching the TV transmission on October 8, 2002, which was disturbed by a solar flare 93,000,000 from Earth, the fuzzy dots on the screen would be telling them to bring in the tomatoes, stock up on firewood, and make sure all the flashlights in the house work, because they would also know that this field disruption can also disturb other types of fields which could result in electrical outages, crazy weather, and even earthquakes.  <img src='../Images/forces.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>This same reasoning applies to the thologram, as the first, and largest, tholon is unaffected by any external forces, while the tholons on the edge of creation, that *boundary layer* between order and chaos, where *somethingness* expands into *nothingness*, are bombarded by the external forces of the countless surrounding tholons.   

The difference between particles and <u>data</u>, instances and <u>archetypes</u>, is that particle <u>movement</u> is also affected by gravity.  The smaller the particle, the more effect external forces have and the less effect gravity has.  The dominance of external forces vs. gravity is well known.  

How does gravity relate to <u>tholons</u>?  If we momentarily accept the hypothesis previously mentioned that gravity is an instance of <u>awareness</u> (<u>consciousness</u>), then can we speculate that in the non-physical realm of <u>tholons</u>, <u>concepts</u>, <u>ideas</u>, etc., we would see a similar <u>pattern</u>, but replacing gravity with <u>awareness</u> or <u>consciousness</u>?  What would this tell us?  The first thing we would see is that the first <u>tholon</u> would be all encompassing, and instantiate as pure <u>awareness</u> and define the limits of all this it contains.  All measurements are relative to these initial limits, such as *c*, the <u>speed of light</u>.  As the first <u>tholon</u> is in a void of <u>nothingness</u>, it can not be measures relative to anything else. 

### Relative Archetypes

This is somewhat similar to Relativity Theory, but we are not going to get into the details Special Relativity, General Relativity, Lorentz Transformations, and all the other stuff that such topics inevitably lead to.  Instead, we will just state the following: The <u>speed of light</u> is symbolized as *c*, but *c* is actually the *speed of causality*; it is the maximum speed at which any two parts of the universe can interact, or the *speed of cause and effect*.  This includes the <u>speed of light</u>, gravity <u>waves</u>, gluons, or anything that has no <u>mass</u>.  Were *c* infinite, as was once believed, cause and effect would happen instantly, and all of <u>existence</u> would be one short lived but very intense blip, and then over. 

Time would also not exist if *c* was infinite because everything would happen instantly, so the fact that *c* does have a limit is why time exists, as time is a measure of the speed of causality.  Remember that *m=E/c<sup>2</sup>*? This means <u>mass</u> is <u>energy</u> divided by *c*<sup>2</sup>, or 8.98755179 × 10<sup>16</sup> meters<sup>2</sup> / secs<sup>2</sup>.  That is a pretty, pretty big reduction of <u>energy</u>.  Mass is really, really slow <u>energy</u>, and by “slow” we mean a reduction in the speed of causality. and by that we mean, <u>mass</u> moves moves slower that <u>energy</u>.  Before you think to yourself “Duh!”, imagine what that means on a cosmic scale.  Only <u>mass</u> has gravity, and <u>mass</u> is slow <u>energy</u>, and slow <u>energy</u> is the result of time, and time is the speed of causality, ergo, the more <u>mass</u>, the slower the time.  And that is exactly what we see.  The more gravity, the slower the time.  Clocks on <u>earth</u> tick slower that clocks in space.  The current thinking that it is time that creates gravity can also be thought of as the slower speed of causality causing gravity, and the more the <u>mass</u>, the slower that causality, all the way up to a <u>black hole</u> where time stops at the event horizon.  Yes, there is no time inside a <u>black hole</u>, and having no time, it can not have space-time, but does have infinite gravity.  This is why a <u>black hole</u> is said to have 0 volume.  Is it, in fact, a 0-dimensional point, a <u>singularity</u>, making <u>black holes</u> no more than a <u>concept</u>, but a <u>concept</u> that shapes our universe.  

In the <u>tholonic</u> model, if *E* is SAI, the originating *N-source*, then *Definition/<u>limitation</u>* (via *c*) creates *time*, resulting in the *Contribution/integration* quality of *space*.  Yes, from a relativistic view, space and time are 2 sides to the space-time coin and both came into <u>existence</u> together.  From the <u>tholonic</u> view, while they did come into <u>existence</u> together, there is still a path of their creation.  All <u>numbers</u> came into <u>existence</u> simultaneously, but we still have to go through 2 to get to 3.  We now have a spectrum of space-time across which many <u>patterns</u> will form.  Presumably, the first <u>patterns</u> formed on this spectrum were things like the EM <u>radiation</u> followed by matter and the gravitational fields, or, if you prefer the alternative theory of the <u>Big Bang</u>, the gravitational fields came before matter and were so strong they created matter. Either way, EM <u>radiation</u>, gravity, and possibly matter, are the first instantiations of SAI.  Perhaps EM <u>radiation</u> is an instance of Awareness and gravity is in instance of Intention, as these pairings are <u>conceptually</u> equivalent in many ways.  Culturally, we have equated light (EM <u>radiation</u>) with <u>awareness</u>, as in the *enlightened* who have heightened <u>awareness</u>, and the <u>concept</u> of *gravity* with the weight of serious goals, aims, purpose, responsibility, stability, etc. as in the *gravitas* of a deep thinker.

These Relativistic <u>concepts</u> map nicely onto the <u>tholonic</u> model and can tell us a lot about how <u>tholons</u> functions.  The Brownian <u>concepts</u> tell us more about the <u>tholon</u> as a whole, suggesting that the smaller <u>tholons</u> are more controlled by external forces, or circumstances, than <u>awareness</u>, but always have *some* element of <u>awareness</u>.  This idea also fits nicely with the <u>tholonic</u> view of the reality that rocks, chairs and toasters do not have any observable form of <u>awareness</u>, but <u>tholonically</u> have *some* element of <u>awareness</u>. 

From the <u>tholonic</u> view, all of <u>existence</u>, in one form or another, is an instance of SAI, but that which is alive, which grows and reproduces, are the first *observable* instance of <u>consciousness</u> even if we don’t consider the far broader <u>tholonic</u> <u>definition</u> of “living organism”, which would include <u>planets</u>, galaxies, and the Universe.  This is because living organisms have a *<u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u>* that is capable of creativity, learning, problem-solving, logic, and planning.  However, a few <u>life</u> forms, such as primates, dolphins, and at least one dog (mine), have the ability to consciously direct their intentions, independent of any biological needs or instincts. One might call that *free will*, but we’ll avoid that prickly <u>concept</u> for now (as we address it later). What can be said is, the more SAI is instantiated, the more <u>energy</u> that is in motion, the more <u>microstates</u> of expansion available, the higher the entropy, the greater the <u>balancing</u> <u>potential</u>.

### The Return to Nothingness

<img src='../Images/EGM.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>If you drop a rock in a still pond, there is a big splash, then a bunch of waves that spread out as the energy of the impact disturbs the still water.  Eventually, everything calms down and the water is calm again.  The inevitable return to calm is due to entropy, but entropy cannot exist without gravity.  Entropy, gravity and mass is one of the *uber*-trinities upon which this 3-dimensional space-time reality is built.  Remove any one of these elements, and reality, as we know it, ceases to exist. If we can say the water returns to calm due to entropy, we can also say it is due to mass and/or gravity.  That’s why the concept of entropy was invented, as it’s easier to deal with than having to continually calculate the loss of heat of energy over time, the amount of heat due to friction, the force of that friction based on the masses involved (with their own gravitational fields), etc., etc.

The <u>Big Bang</u> was that rock that got dropped in the still waters of the void.  There was a splash, and we are currently riding the <u>waves</u> of that disturbance, but eventually, the universe will return to a state of calm, perhaps even the <u>nothingness</u> it once was.  More to the point, if everything that exists is preceded by its <u>archetypes</u>, and <u>archetypes</u> are formed by stable <u>patterns</u> as a result of the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>, then all <u>movement</u> is either diverging from one <u>archetype</u> or <u>converging</u> towards another (or others).

In the case of the pond, the <u>archetype</u> it diverged from when it was disturbed was that of a *Still Pond*, and after the disturbance, the <u>archetype</u> it returns to is also that of a *Still Pond*, but the instance of the *Still Pond* has been changed slightly by the disturbance.  Technically, the same could be said about the rock, but as the rock was essentially unchanged by dropping it into the water, the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> was inconsequential, at least for this example.  If a ton of water was dropped into the pond, things would be a lot more complicated, but the fundamentals would be the same&hellip; the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> that diverges from its most stable <u>archetype</u>(s) goes through many changes and forms many <u>patterns</u> and <u>archetypes</u> in the process of returning to the most stable <u>pattern</u> possible.  If the context is changed as a result of the disturbance, for example, rather than a rock, a meteor, then the resulting <u>archetypes</u> will not be the same as the initial <u>archetypes</u>.  As there is only one <u>archetype</u> that has an absolute context, then it is that <u>archetype</u> that all other <u>archetypes</u> and all <u>energy</u> ultimately tends towards, and that is the first <u>archetype</u>, which is created by the 0D dot of SAI.

<img src='../Images/4forces.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>If, as the tholonic model requires, every sustainable archetype instantiates in some form in the physical world, as that is an inevitable consequence of, and prerequisite for, its sustainability. Where can we find an instance of this primal archetype that all energy tends towards and will eventually arrive at?  Not surprisingly, the obvious candidate is the *Standard Model*, or the four fundamental forces of nature, which are: the strong force, electromagnetic force, the weak force, and gravity.  These forces are a good example of 2 forces, *attraction* and *charge*,  in the 2 contexts of parent and child.  The stronger force of attraction holds together matter (gravity) and nuclei (strong force).  The the weaker force transfers energy waves (electromagnetic force) and energy particles (weak force of the W and Z *boson* particles that can transform neutrons to protons and neutrinos to electrons).

The <u>atomic</u> forces apply in the contextual range of the size of the nucleus, or about 10<sup>-13</sup> meters.  The universal forces apply in the context of the Universe and extend to the edge of the universe.  *(Note: Technically, the EM <u>force</u> is greater than gravity, but as there can be negative EM forces, and there can’t be negative <u>mass</u>, the EM <u>force</u> can be neutralized or less than 0, while gravity can only be lessened and can never be 0 or less.)* While all <u>mass</u> can be effected by the EM <u>force</u>, only the <u>force</u> of gravity exerts a constant pull.  Gravity is the <u>force</u> that all matter tends towards, making gravity the <u>archetype</u> that a[^93]: Media, T. E. (2015, June 02). Rupert Sheldrake, **Heretic**. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSd4DA5xhHw>ll <u>energy</u> tends towards.   

Science has theorized that at the end of time there will be nothing left in the universe except the <u>black holes</u> that all matter has fallen into due to their immense gravitational pull.  This gravitational field at a point of a <u>black hole</u> <u>singularity</u> can (we think) infinitely warp space-time.  Science can only guess how that will effect the *Strong Nuclear Force*, but it’s probably safe to say that if time and space go bye-bye, the SNF won’t function the same way.  It is most likely that the <u>black hole</u> destroys all <u>structure</u> down to the quantum level, creating a ball of pure, dense, concentrated&hellip;“stuff”.  These <u>black holes</u> then slowly radiate their “stuff” away over the next 3&times;10<sup>107</sup> years, leaving a perfect void of <u>nothingness</u>.  Science has a problem with this, and they call it the “Information paradox”, because according to <u>science</u>, everything can’t just disappear into a void of <u>nothingness</u>, but according to this theory, it does, so they are diligently working to come up with various solutions to this paradox that use wormholes, quantum effects, “Fuzzballs”, and “Soft-Hair”  (actual names) theories.  A few existential scientists think that, yes, in the end, everything returns to <u>nothingness</u>.

However, if we can accept the idea that the fundamental <u>archetype</u> for matter (gravity) is an instance of the fundamental <u>archetype</u> for <u>consciousness</u> (SAI), as some scientists have already suggested, then while the material world may return to <u>nothingness</u>, the SAI that started it all has not, because, being a 0D <u>concept</u>, it can’t be destroyed because it doesn't actually exist.  Perhaps that is why new Big Bangs, new instances of the first <u>movement</u> of Awareness and Intelligence, and the new universes they create, can, according to at least one theory, occur *within* the Black Holes, just as this universe is inside some Black Hole “somewhere else” in “reality”.

These highly speculative <u>ideas</u> are primarily meant so explore how existing <u>concepts</u> can be applied to new contexts.  Perhaps they are useless, but more likely, they will offer *some* insights into new territories, from *spontaneous deduction* and  *mutual <u>knowledge</u>*[^351] to multidimensional communication and travel.
