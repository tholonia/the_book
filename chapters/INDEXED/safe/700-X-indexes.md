# Appendix X: Indexes

###### More of a <u>conceptual</u> meta-data overview

What follows are the indexes of the book.  The 1<sup>st</sup> index is <u>order</u> by words, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> index if ordered by <u>work</u> but within their categories.  

These categories are:

- **Archetypes**: These are <u>concepts</u> of <u>knowledge</u> and <u>understanding</u>; *<u>numbers</u>, <u>atoms</u>, <u>balance</u>, <u>chaos</u>, &hellip;*.

- **Energy**: Concepts that are used to understand <u>energy</u>; *<u>force</u>, <u>movement</u>, <u>thermodynamics</u>, &hellip;.* 

- **Instances**: the material expressions of a <u>ideas</u>, <u>concept</u>, definitions, or <u>archetypes</u>; *<u>asteroids</u>, the <u>Algonquin</u> tribe, <u>brain</u>, &hellip;*

- **Models**: Paradigms of <u>understanding</u>; *<u>alchemy</u>, <u>medicine</u>, parasitism, <u>aliens</u>, <u>biology</u>, &hellip;*

- **Order**: Laws, processes, and phenomena that define, create, or expose <u>order</u>; *<u>cycles</u>, entropy, Fourier transforms, <u>intelligence</u>,&hellip;*

- **People**: Any name name that appears in the body of the book is listed here.

How some <u>concepts</u> are categorized may be debatable, but this is their current state.

The indexes are meant more as an overview of the <u>concepts</u> covered in the book with in indication of their weight (as indicated by their page <u>numbers</u>), and also to provide an easily perusable list of the many different topics that are covered.
