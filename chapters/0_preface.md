## Brief Introduction

Some of the concepts mention in this appendix have been thoroughly detailed in the book, so they may seem odd or out of context when used here.  

There are a few terms in this chapter that are defined elsewhere in the book, so they are briefly explained here.

**DEFINITION** (in caps): Refers to the limitations, restrictions, resistance, etc., that are imposed on any system depending on its context.  For example, the size of insects is limited by, or defined by, the available oxygen in the environment and gravity (mainly).  300 million years ago, dragonflies were 1 meter wide, and today they are 90% smaller.  

**CONTRIBUTION** (in caps): Refers to how an instance of a DEFINITION alters the context, i.e., more dragonflies result in fewer mosquitoes and more birds.  As dragonflies require clean water, mosquitoes will prefer swamps, which alters to frog population.  More birds mean fewer rodents, fewer rodents mean fewer animals of prey, which means more grazing animals -> less ground covering -> more erosion, etc., etc.

**NEGOTIATION** (in caps): Refers to the balancing of opposing forces that must stabilize for a context to exist.   For example, the exact balance of gravity and centrifugal force must be maintained for a planet to maintain an orbit.

**N-State**:  This is a new point of NEGOTIATION that emerge from the stable instance of the opposing forces of DEFINITION and CONTRIBUTION.

These three concepts relate to one-another in a (holarchic) hierarchical, self-similar manner, as shown below (in a very limited context).

**White-dot**: From this 2-dimensional form of embedded trigrams we can form a 3-dimensional tetrahedron, and in doing so, the red, green and blue points join to form the 4<sup>th</sup> white point of a tetrahedron.  This is the *white dot*.

Because of this form’s self-similar and embedded nature, we end up with a progression like the following:

This final form is what is called the “thologram”, and is a collection of tetrahedral holons, or “tholons”. 

A **holon** ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language): ὅλον, from ὅλος, *holos*, 'whole' and -ον, *-on*, 'part') is something that is simultaneously a whole in and of itself, as well as a part of a larger whole.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)#cite_note-1) In other words, holons can be understood as the constituent [part–wholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part–whole_theory) of a [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)#cite_note-:0-2)
