# 6: <u>INFORMATION</u>

###### <u>Information</u> follows the same rules as everything else in nature.

##### **Synopsis:** Just as there an unfolding of <u>reality</u> via *<u>chaos</u> $\rightarrow$ <u>pattern</u> $\rightarrow$ <u>order</u> $\rightarrow$ integration*, there is an unfolding of *<u>data</u> $\rightarrow$ <u>information</u> $\rightarrow$ <u>knowledge</u> $\rightarrow$ <u>understanding</u>* or *sound $\rightarrow$ notes $\rightarrow$ scales $\rightarrow$ music*. <u>Order</u>, being self-similar, naturally forms <u>hierarchies</u>, and the most stable of these <u>hierarchies</u> will be found at the optimal <u>balance</u> of the <u>duality</u> it exists within.  This not only applies to the emergence of <u>awareness</u>, but to the biological <u>structure</u> through which <u>awareness</u> is expressed as individual <u>consciousness</u> which inherits these same properties and processes.

The same <u>patterns</u> that we see in the world around us we can find in the <u>data</u> from the world around us, thus transforming <u>data</u> into information.  How, then, do we define *<u>data</u>* and *<u>information</u>*?

## <u>Data</u>

To begin to answer that, we can deduce that there is no <u>data</u> in the void of nothingness.  <u>Data</u> can only exist within a <u>duality</u>, which implies that there is <u>energy</u>, which implies <u>oscillation</u> within finite boundaries in accordance with specific <u>laws</u> of existence.  So, what is the difference between <u>data</u> and <u>existence</u> itself? 

#### **Key 50:** <u>Data</u> is the static byproduct of the <u>movement</u> of energy.

<u>Data</u> is static because all <u>data</u> is *<u>stateful</u>*, which means <u>data</u> has no dependence on, or relationship to, anything in the past.  The process that generates the <u>data</u> may have such dependencies or relationships, which would make it a *<u>stateless</u>* process, but the <u>data</u> produced can only represent the *state* of a system and any given moment.  Flipping a coin is *<u>stateful</u>*, as there is a 50/50 chance it will be heads or tails regardless of the result of the last 100 flips, but the odds of flipping 101 heads is a row is about 4&times;10<sup>-31</sup> because all the *states* of the 101 flips are seen as a larger *system*.

In its most basic form, <u>data</u> is <u>numbers</u>, words, units of measure, and other <u>conceptual</u> abstractions we invented to describe the phenomena within the spectrum of <u>existence</u> we can perceive and use. 

If we accept the premise that everything that exists does so within the <u>laws</u> of creation, then we also need to accept that nothing exists that is not in perfect harmony with these <u>laws</u> because if they were not in perfect harmony with the <u>laws</u> they would not exist.  Therefore, everything that can exist does, and everything that cannot exist does not, which implicitly tells us that:

#### **Key 51:** All <u>data</u> is valid.

Depending on what theory of <u>reality</u> you prefer, “everything” can mean all of that which exists as this moment, or, if you subscribe to the *<u>Block Theory</u>* of the <u>Universe</u>,  *Special Relativity*, or *Quantum Theory*, “everything” *must* mean everything that every did, does, or will exist.  

The <u>tholonic</u> view is much simpler; if <u>data</u> is a by-product of <u>existence</u>, than something only exists if it is producing <u>data</u>, regardless of whether anyone or anything can detect that data.

This view suggests that everything that ever did, is, or will exist currently exist somewhere in the grand scheme of <u>reality</u>, but in our corner of <u>reality</u>, the <u>existence</u> of that which *is* depends wholly on something’s ability to observe it.  This is true not just on a practical level, as we can’t say something exists if we have no <u>awareness</u> of that thing, but also on a technical level if there is any <u>truth</u> to the *Copenhagen interpretation of <u>quantum mechanics</u>* that the act of observation, of becoming aware of the <u>data</u> of an <u>existence</u>, is what causes the <u>wave</u> functions of quantum probability, i.e., <u>archetypes</u>, to “collapse” into material form.  We say that <u>awareness</u> causes these quantum <u>archetypes</u> to instantiate as matter, but it may also be the case that <u>archetypes</u> collapsing into matter causes <u>awareness</u>, suggesting <u>awareness</u> came into <u>existence</u> when the first instance came into <u>existence</u>, thereby making <u>awareness</u> a universal property, at least according to Roger <u>Penrose</u>, the mathematical physicist considered to be “the most important physicist to <u>work</u> in relativity theory except for <u>Einstein</u>”[^395].

[^395]:Lee Smolin, a theoretical physicist and  founder of *Perimeter Institute*, and one of the most innovative theoretical physicists in the world, refers to Roger Penrose as someone who “is the most important physicist to work in relativity theory except for Einstein. He is one of the very few people I’ve met in my life who, without reservation, I call a genius.” 

<img src='../Images/tatom_cuttri-1-4.png' style='float:right;width:20%'>Science doesn’t know which came first, awareness or archetype, so it could be *archetype + awareness = instance* or *archetype &rarr; instance = awareness*.  In either case, we have some relationship between these properties as the archetypes contains the models of everything that can or will ever exist, and they produce data, but it is not until we find that data, or become aware of that data, that some *thing* can be said to exist.  This is why we say things that are undetectable exist, such as quarks, black holes, 11-dimensional strings, and even time itself, because data says they exist.

**Where Here When Now**

This deserves a little more of an explanation.

The <u>tholonic</u> view is that the difference between what *does* exists and what *can* exist is the different between the *here and now* and the  *not here and not now*.  We understand the single phenomena of *<u>space-time</u>* as having the properties of *space* and *time* which we also understand as the properties of *where* and *when*.  

The state of something at any moment describes only that moment, not the past or the future, as <u>data</u> alone is *<u>stateful</u>*.  How it came to produce the present <u>data</u>, and the <u>data</u> it will produce in the future, depends on the <u>patterns</u> of the <u>data</u>, which is *<u>stateless</u>*.  

However, the present has no past or future.  This makes the present a *<u>stateful</u>* condition of *<u>space-time</u>* that has no past and no future and its only temporal attribute is *now*.  Likewise, the only spacial attribute of *now* can be *here*. In this context, *here* refers to the *system* of *<u>space-time</u>*, a domain that includes the entire <u>Universe</u> in all its dimensions.  You may be thinking “If <u>I am</u> *here* and you are *there*, then there is obviously a *there* there”, and that would be correct if *here* referred to the system, or subsystem, of an observer whose domain is limited by their ability to perceive. From the perspective of the <u>Universe</u>, or even the <u>Multiverse</u>, there can only be a single *here* for beyond *here* is nothingness.  Within that single *here* that can be multiple *heres*, and within each of those *heres* there are more *heres*, ad infinitum. This is somewhat similar to Relativity's claim that the perception of time is the same for everyone regardless of how their time appears to others.  In the same way, everyone’s *here* is the same regardless of where their *here* is, regardless of how the other *heres*, or the *there-nows*, appear to them.

Our ability to grasp the <u>concepts</u> of *past* and *future* allows us to understand <u>pattern</u> and change, which allows us to plan and predict, but neither is “real”, at least in the way we classically understand these concepts.  The *<u>stateless</u>* conditions of *where-when* are simply historical records of a once *here-now* of a past present&hellip; at least most of the time.  There are some experiments where it appears as though the present can alter the past, and the future can alter the present[^396], so we may have to expand our <u>understanding</u> of “past” and “future” just as <u>science</u> has already done for the <u>concept</u> of “real”, which, from a scientific perspective, is defined as:

[^396]: Jacques, Vincent, E Wu, Frédéric Grosshans, François Treussart, Alain Aspect, Philippe Grangier, and Jean-François Roch. “**Experimental Realization of Wheeler’s Delayed-Choice Gedanken Experiment.**” Conference on Coherence and Quantum Optics, 2007. https://doi.org/10.1364/cqo.2007.cwb4., https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0610241.pdf

> <u>Something is real when it</u> is a necessary ingredient of a theory that correctly describes what we observe. **~Sabine <u>Hossenfelder</u>, theoretical physicist**

Ironically, this scientific definition leaves the door wide open for some very liberal definitions of “real” once we begin to question the meaning of “observe” and “theory”.

Many books, theories, and speculations exist on the true <u>nature</u> of time, but we are going  to take the simplest reductionist (and therefore most likely to be correct)  approach and claim that *here* and *now* are not only *real*, but are the only aspects of *spacetime* that are *real*.

<center><img src='../Images/states.png' style='width:90%'></center>

What was just said about the temporal aspect of spacetime also applies to the spatial aspect of spacetime. A point of <u>data</u> is a 0-dimensional <u>concept</u>, but let’s imagine it as a red dot for this thought experiment.  In the image above we see a single <u>data</u> and collections of <u>data</u>, but we clearly see <u>patterns</u> that are not dependent on past or future as we are seeing then now.  In this case, the <u>data</u> points are still *<u>stateful</u>* even though they create a <u>pattern</u> because the <u>pattern</u> is result of the *relationships* between the <u>data</u> points, so the relationship is *<u>stateless</u>*, but the <u>data</u> is still *<u>stateful</u>*. 

In the temporal case, <u>data</u> is produced in the *present*, the *now*.  In the spatial case, <u>data</u> is produced at a location, which would describe as where the <u>data</u> is from, but from th <u>data</u>’s perspective, the location is always *here*.  This sounds odd because we don’t think of <u>data</u> having a location, but it has a location in at least 2 domains.  The first domain is that of instantiation, such as matter or energy. If we are measuring a desk, that desk has a location.  If we are measuring heat, we are measuring it at some location, etc.

<img src='../Images/datatri.png' style='float:right;width:40%'>The other domain is where any piece of data exists in the spectrum of all data which, we’ll call the *data-matrix*. For example, take any number, such as 7.  7 is a piece of data and it comes after 6 and before 8; that is its location in the spectrum of data.  Every piece of data that can exist is a distinct unit that is defined by limits and its relationship to other pieces of data.  In fact, data has to come from that perfectly structured set of values, the *data-matrix*,  otherwise it would be useless.  That is why we invented numbers to be perfectly structured, and why math works.  When we measure anything, we are mapping something that exists in some state of chaos to a perfectly ordered set of data that never changes.  If we measure something as 7, be it 7 degrees, 7 feet, 7 days, we are saying that whatever we measure equates via some definition such as temperature, distance, or time, to a particular location in the conceptual landscape of the *data-matrix*.  One way to view the relationship between the chaos of reality, the order of the data matrix, and the definitions we create that enables us to relate them, is shown in the image above.

<img src='../Images/timedots.png' style='float:right;width:40%'>There is the *stateless* relationship between *stateful* data at any point in time.  This collection of data points we’ll call a *data-frame*.  In every moment of time, a new data-frame is created and our perception of the *differences* in these data-frames is what accounts for reality as we know it.  Reality is the difference between relationships in both space (relationships in a data-frame) and time (relationships between data-frames).  We are going to accept the current claim a “moment” of time is  10<sup>−44</sup> seconds, as this is *Planck time*, the time it takes a photon to travel the shortest length that can exist, which is *Planck’s length* (1.62 × 10<sup>-35</sup> meters).

All this was a fairly wide detour to simply say that what *does* exist exists in *here-how*, and what *can* exists exists in *here-when*.  In terms of <u>data</u>, we know we can splice the genes of a human toe into mouse genetics and we’d get a mouse with a human toe growing out of its back, but a back-toed mouse does not exist (hopefully) in *here-now* and therefore is not currently producing <u>data</u>, so a back-toed-mouse *could* exist, but currently does *not* exist.  As there is no *state* of back-toed-mouse, and as <u>data</u> is *<u>stateful</u>* and requires a *state* to exist, no <u>data</u> exists. 

#### **Key 52:** All <u>data</u> is valid, is only created in the present, and is stateful.

What, then, is <u>information</u>? The classic and simplest definition is “*<u>data</u> that we can use to understand something*”, which is just another way of saying “*<u>Information</u> is <u>data</u> that has meaning*”, but we need to first understand what “understand” means before we can understand what “<u>information</u>” means.  What we could say about <u>information</u> here, which we mentioned earlier, is that <u>information</u> must be *<u>stateless</u>* because it consists of <u>data</u> of many *states*, giving it a “<u>memory</u>” of previous states and “<u>knowledge</u>” of their relationships.  So we can at least say that *<u>information</u>* is the relationship between *<u>data</u>*.

But what is *<u>understanding</u>*? Again, the traditional meaning is *“the <u>knowledge</u> of why or how something happens or works”.* This is pretty unsatisfactory, and quite arguably wrong.  At the risk of sounding Clinton-esque here, debating what the definition of “is” is, the words *“use”* and *“understand”* are completely subjective and offer no real definition, and with the word “<u>work</u>” defined as simply *“to function or operate according to design”*, this entire definition is vague, as best.

Can we come up with a better definition of the words *<u>knowledge</u>* and *<u>understanding</u>*?

To know something’s function and purpose is the fundamental goal of <u>science</u>, philosophy and even <u>religion</u>, as these disciplines require a demonstrative <u>understanding</u> which we can see in their relative forms of reasoning.

Like in the dancing-woman-in-the-dots example, we can perceive something that is little more than subjective projection and has no basis in objective reality.  It is this human ability to “recognize” things in meaningless images that brought about the famous Rorschach inkblot test as it provides some insight into how a person perceives the world by their perception of <u>patterns</u> they project onto the <u>random</u> images.

In the world of philosophy, this knowledge-as-projection is exemplified in the *cow in the <u>field</u> problem* first posed by American philosopher Edmund Gettier.  It goes like this:

> A farmer is concerned his prize cow has gotten lost.  A neighbor comes to the farmer and tells him he saw the cow in his field.  Just to double-check,  the farmer visits the neighbor’s <u>field</u> and sees the familiar black and white shape of his cow.  Satisfied, he goes home.  The neighbor also decided to check.  The cow is in the <u>field</u>, but it’s hidden behind some large bushes.  Caught in the bushes, however, is a large sheet of black and white paper.  It is clear that the farmer saw this and thought it was his cow.  The question is then: even though the cow was in the <u>field</u>, was the farmer correct when he said he knew it was there?

This was meant as a criticism of the popular definition of *<u>knowledge</u>* as *justified true belief*, meaning, if you believe something and it is both factually true and verifiable, then that is *<u>knowledge</u>*.  This is a terribly misguided post-modern idea of <u>knowledge</u>, in my humble opinion, because by this definition the dancing-woman-in-the-dots *is* <u>knowledge</u>, as it satisfies all three conditions.  By this definition, *<u>understanding</u>* is vulnerable to subjective perception, which has its own merits, but is worthless, even destructive, when it comes to <u>understanding</u> the objective aspects of the <u>laws</u> of existence.

By the way, this critique also applies to <u>science</u>, because if “<u>Something is real when it</u> is a necessary ingredient of a theory that correctly describes what we observe”, then in the *cow in the <u>field</u>* problem, scientifically speaking, the cow *was* in the field… but, it wasn’t.

Simply *knowing* the details of a situation is not the same as *<u>understanding</u>* them.  We can see this in the countless cases of confusing or challenging situations that demand critical decisions that inevitably fall prey to our conscious or unconscious beliefs, desires, and fears.  We can see this difference even in less dramatic situations, such as knowing all the details about camping, and actually camping, or the difference between the map and the terrain.

A better definition of <u>understanding</u> might be “the <u>knowledge</u> of something sufficient enough to be able to make verifiably accurate <u>statements regarding said</u> thing”.

## Verification

But this too falls short depending on what *verifiable* means.  For example, four people have to solve the following puzzle:

What is the next <u>number</u> in this sequence? 91715

Bob says “1”, and Carol says “3”.  Bob defends his answer by showing the obvious; that 71 is 20 less than 91, therefore 51, being 20 less than 71, is the obvious pattern.  Carol, however, says it is 3 because 917153 is, in fact, a sequence of <u>numbers</u> in *pi*.  Ted also says “1” but because 9+1=10, 7+1=8, therefore 5+*x* = 6, so *x* must be 1.  Alice says “9” because that would result in three prime <u>numbers</u> 11, 13, and 17 using the 2D lattice she made to solve the problem.

All four people have an <u>understanding</u> of the problem and the ways in which it can be solved, and therefore all four answers are verifiable.  It’s not unlike when you ask a child what is 1+1, and she confidently answers “6”.  When asked why 1+1 = 6 she says: *“I had one white cat and one gray cat, now I have six cats; two white cats, two gray cats, a black cat and a cat that is all colors”* referring to her two cats and their 4 new kittens.  Not only did 1+1 equal 6, but it came in many colors and was soft and cuddly.

As silly as this sounds, her answer was quite accurate given the context and the <u>scope</u> of a child’s <u>understanding</u> and the context of *“1 (female cat) + 1 (male cat)”*, which is not at all an irrelevant detail, especially to the cats.  We can see the “error” here as the child not being able to properly identify the differences between the overlapping contexts of <u>math</u> and animals.  We should not be quick to judge this child because we have to assume that even the greatest thinkers will make the same “error”, albeit with more complex contexts, because this discernment is a product of our <u>neurology</u>, the <u>brain</u> being a big <u>pattern</u> recognition machine.  Unless we have the ultimate <u>brain</u>, we can’t recognize everything.

<u>Understanding</u> is contextual and only relevant to the degree that it applies to the matter in question and why the question was asked in the first place.  Even the <u>concept</u> of “1” is contextually relevant.  We may have 1 dollar or 1 day, but what does 1 mean if we say we have 1 puddle plus 1 puddle? We either have 2 puddles, or, if they are connected, we have 1 big puddle, and now “2” is not the unit count of puddles, but the relative volume of the puddle, i.e.  1 puddle that is 2 times as large.  If we drop 1 rock into a lake, we have 1 <u>wave</u> function.  If we drop 2 rocks in a lake we have 2 <u>wave</u> functions that <u>interfere</u> with each other.  So we could say:

“1”=<IMG src="../Images/math/335.svg" style="vertical-align:middle;height:12pt"/> as this is the general description of a wave.

“2”=<IMG src="../Images/math/336.svg" style="vertical-align:middle;height:22pt"/> as this is the description of two <u>waves</u> <u>interfering</u> with each other.

What happens if we take 1 particle traveling at *x* speed, and smash it headfirst into another particle traveling at *x* speed? You might think that the particles smash into each other at the speed of *2x*, but you’d be wrong if *x* was the <u>speed of light</u>, because, at the <u>speed of light</u> *1+1 = 1* in this case, at least according to the Theory of Relativity.[^46] More specifically, the product of the two opposing speeds when multiplied together can never *appear* to exceed *c*, the <u>speed of light</u>, so here 1+1 could equal any of the infinite values between 1 and 2.

Our ability to count is shared by other living creatures, the main difference being the <u>concept</u> and application of “counting”.  For example, <u>fish can count</u> in the sense that they can measure the relative size of a school of fish, so they have a <u>concept</u> of *greater then* and *less than*, at least.  This is a useful skill as the size of the school is directly related to their chances of survival.  <u>Frogs can count</u> as well as perform addition; a female frog (from one <u>species</u>)  measures <u>potential</u> mates by the <u>number</u> of croaks they can make in a row, so at some level she is calculating “Contestant #1 croaked 5 times, but contestant #2 croaked 6 times”, and because the males are competing, contestant #2 had to “count” the croaks of contestant #1, then add 1, and then count down his own 6 croaks [^312].

[^312]: Rose GJ. **“The numerical abilities of anurans and their neural correlates: insights from neuroethological studies of acoustic communication.”** Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2017 Feb 19;373(1740):20160512. doi: 10.1098/rstb.2016.0512. PMID: 29292359; PMCID: PMC5784039.

In many animals there are *accumulator* or *counting* <u>neurons</u> whose job is to send out a signal every time something is *recognized*, and by *recognized*, we mean the <u>information</u> that can be processed by the rest of the <u>brain</u>, i.e, the neurological component of a concept.  A <u>monkey</u> will “count” the <u>bananas in a tree</u>, but it won’t “count” how many people in the plaza are wearing Gucci.  In some creatures, including <u>humans</u> and fruit flies, there exists the *timeless*, or *tim*, gene that is critical to the “counting” necessary for managing the inner circadian clock.  More sophisticated counting comes from networks of <u>neurons</u> collecting and sharing data.

Knowing how man bananas there are, or knowing that 5+1 croaks are necessary, is the application of <u>information</u> to some context, such as food or mating, and that is the definition of knowledge.

#### **Key 53:** <u>Knowledge</u> is the application of relevant <u>information</u> to a context.

Imagine how <u>humans</u> might count if/when our <u>neurology</u> is far more evolved and interconnected.  Will <u>numbers</u> seem quaint?   Will we one day be able to process <u>information</u> in an analog fashion rather than with discrete digits?  <u>Nature</u> is analog (or at least appears so), and analog systems solve problems as fast as <u>physics</u> allow.  Perhaps one day <u>numbers</u> will no longer be necessary.

<u>Reality</u>, as we know it, depends on the context of not only what is happening, but all that has happened before, in whatever contexts the <u>contributing</u> events happened in, most of which we can only speculate about.  Our <u>understanding</u> of anything can only be relative to our context and is only valid within that context.  

So, let’s modify the meaning of <u>understanding</u> to the following claim:

#### **Key 54:** <u>Understanding</u> is the <u>knowledge</u> of something sufficient enough to be able to make verifiably accurate <u>statements regarding said</u> thing within the context of its current application.

With this definition, Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice can all make statements based on their <u>understanding</u>, but none of them are verifiable unless we know why the question was asked.  If the point was to see if they had reasoning abilities, they are all right, and so was the little girl, according to their relative reasoning abilities, and the specific question itself is irrelevant as any <u>number</u> of questions could be asked to get the same results.  If the point of the question was to try and recover the last digit of a telephone <u>number</u>, there’s a 10% chance any one answer is correct, including the little girl’s answer, and the question was still meaningless.

We can now answer the question “How do we define *<u>information</u>*?” If we accept that all <u>data</u> is valid and is therefore *<u>information</u>* that is merely undiscovered due to our limited <u>understanding</u> of its relevance to context, *<u>information</u>* now can be defined as the following claim:

#### **Key 55:** <u>Information</u> is relevant <u>data</u> that we know how, when and where to apply given our <u>understanding</u> of the applicable context.


In short, <u>information</u> is *relevant <u>data</u>*.

## <u>Data</u> to <u>Information</u>

<u>Data</u>, being an abstract byproduct of everything, is, by itself, meaningless, just as the <u>existence</u> of matter is, by itself, meaningless.  <u>Data</u> alone is the <u>conceptual</u> equivalent of chaos.  It creates nothing, has no <u>energy</u>, meaning, direction, form or pattern.

#### **Key 56:** <u>Data</u> alone is chaos.

<u>Information</u>, at least one form of it, is when we can find <u>patterns</u> or <u>laws</u> in the <u>chaos</u> of <u>data</u>, or when we can apply <u>data</u> to an existing <u>pattern</u> or law.  We can go so far as to say *<u>information</u>* is the result of <u>energy</u> being applied to data.

There are many examples of this in <u>nature</u>, of <u>order</u> emerging out of chaos.  One of the simpler examples is the *standing <u>wave</u> <u>pattern</u>*.

### Standing <u>Wave</u> <u>Patterns</u>

For those who do not know what a *standing <u>wave</u> <u>pattern</u>* (SWP) is, it is a stable <u>pattern</u> that results from <u>cycles</u> of <u>energy</u>, <u>transmitted</u> as <u>waves</u>, interacting with matter.

Here is a collection of SWPs that were created by placing white powder on a drum head and exposing that drum head to various stable sounds, like a single tone, or a collection of single tones.  This process is called *<u>cymatics</u>*.

<center><img src='../Images/027-cymatics.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here are some more complex cymatic <u>patterns</u> from the 12 notes of the 1<sup>st</sup> octave of a piano.

<center><img src='../Images/notes.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The difference between <u>data</u> and <u>information</u> is analogous to the difference between <u>chaos</u> and <u>order</u>, that difference being <u>entropy</u> and energy.  

<center><img src='../Images/ent-images-3.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Above are two examples of this concept.  In the upper image, we show the example of some <u>random</u> data.  In the lower diagram, we show the <u>evolution</u> of what turns out to be a self-similar <u>pattern</u> (described using the *<u>L-System</u>* <u>language</u>).

**Raw <u>data</u>** is a form of low <u>entropy</u> chaos.  Why? because as these values have no context or meaning, they are nothing more than <u>random</u>, abstract symbols.  There is nothing they can “do”; <u>data</u> alone has no microstates.  Raw <u>data</u> is *<u>potential</u>* <u>information</u>, not *<u>kinetic</u>* <u>information</u> (to borrow the <u>concepts</u> of <u>physics</u>)

**<u>Information</u>** results from applying <u>energy</u> to analyze the <u>data</u>, producing limits, <u>patterns</u>, and relationships.  In the example in the image above, the context is that of simple <u>math</u> functions.  <u>Information</u> equates to *<u>kinetic</u> <u>energy</u>* because it is <u>data</u> that can be used.  From our raw <u>data</u> we discover the relationship between these numbers.

**<u>Knowledge</u>** is then produced when we apply this <u>information</u> is some meaningful manner. <u>Knowledge</u> equates to the application of <u>kinetic</u> <u>energy</u>, such as to run a motor or boil water.  In this case, we have gained the <u>knowledge</u> of how these <u>numbers</u> relate to each other and can apply this <u>knowledge</u> to such things as the <u>laws</u> of motion, <u>electricity</u>, relativity, etc.

**<u>Understanding</u>** is when we extend this <u>knowledge</u> to understand the larger perspective and how it may apply to other scopes and context.

**<u>Noise</u>** is when the <u>growth reaches a point</u> where there is no more contextually usable information.  This is deterioration of that <u>knowledge</u> in that the amount of contextually unusable <u>data</u> from a *system* becomes so great that the usable <u>information</u> is lost.  At this point, the system is simply one of chaos.  The <u>knowledge</u> we have gained is not lost, but the system we used to gain it has reached its limit.  An example of this might be how when speed, <u>gravity</u>, or momentum get too big, Newtonian mechanics spits out garbage <u>data</u>, and you need to move to quantum <u>gravity</u> to find the <u>order</u> in the data.  On that note, it’s worth pointing out that Newton's <u>laws</u> of motion, Relativity, and quantum theory operate in 3 different scopes which overlap and interact.  As mentioned previously, the <u>laws</u> that are valid for one <u>scope</u> may not be valid for another, so applying <u>laws</u> form one <u>scope</u> to another will result in garbage results.  Still, given that there are scopes within scopes, we may find the *uber*-scope that all these scopes exist within, which would be the <u>scope</u> of the *Unified <u>Field</u> Theory* or the *Theory of Everything*.

Another point to consider is how all <u>data</u>, <u>information</u>, <u>knowledge</u> and <u>understanding</u>, in their current state, is just as vulnerable to decay due to <u>thermodynamic</u> <u>entropy</u> as is matter.  This is because all the above forms require matter to survive.  The <u>brain</u> that holds this <u>knowledge</u>, the book it was written down in, the <u>DNA</u> it was encoded into, or any other form of recording, will eventually deteriorate, taking with it the <u>knowledge</u> and returning the <u>data-matrix</u> back to the <u>chaos</u> of the infinite pool of meaningless abstractions.  Sadly, history has many examples of the permanent <u>destruction</u> of <u>knowledge</u> and it’s inevitable, that at some point in the future humanity will be reduced to foraging barbarians, again, as has happened in the past.

We have moved from *<u>data</u>* to *<u>information</u>* to *<u>knowledge</u>* to *<u>understanding</u>* in the following manner, more or less.

- <u>Data</u> + *<u>order</u>* = <u>information</u>
- <u>Information</u> + *context* = <u>knowledge</u>
- <u>Knowledge</u> + *application* = <u>understanding</u>

What comes next? How do all these *understandings* we have discovered relate to one another?

Attempting to answer this question is what gave rise to the entire <u>field</u> of Western philosophy.  In fact, the word *philosophy*, which literally means “<u>love</u> of wisdom”, was invented 2,600 years ago by the Greek mathematician, philosopher and <u>religious</u> mystic, Pythagoras, as the <u>field</u> of study dedicated to <u>understanding</u> how <u>reality</u> is put together.  A few years later, <u>Parmenides</u>, perhaps the most profound and challenging thinker of the Greek philosophers, came up with the idea of categorizing all that was understood about existence.  Today this is called *ontology*, which is <u>hierarchical</u> in <u>nature</u> and comes from the Greek “the study of that which is”.

***Historical note:*** While <u>Parmenides</u> changed the course of philosophical thinking, many of his <u>ideas</u> were considered preposterous, such as the idea that all of <u>reality</u> is an illusion&hellip; which, after 2600 years, with models like the *<u>Simulation</u> Theory* and the *<u>Holographic</u> Theory* of <u>reality</u>, is almost mainstream thinking.

> … unborn and imperishable, whole, unique, immovable and without end.  It was not in the past, nor yet shall be, since it now is, altogether, one and continuous

He warned that the senses give us false <u>information</u> as they only sense the illusion of reality.  Only <u>reason</u> can be trusted.  This branded <u>Parmenides</u> as an “extremist”, and today he is still classified as an *extreme rationalist*.  Not surprisingly, his arguments were based on the rational premise that something either “is” or ”is not”&hellip; a recurring theme in history, and in this book.  <u>Parmenides</u> also appears to be the first Western philosopher that introduced the <u>concept</u> of *<u>nothingness</u>*.  His idea that the act of *becoming* is an <u>incoherent</u> <u>concept</u> is explained by his contemporary, <u>Gorgias</u>, in an argument that is as reasonable as it is humorous,  and is a great example of why philosophers can be so annoying:

> What is cannot have come into being.  If it did, it came either from what is or what is not.  But it did not come from what is, since if it is existent it did not come to be but already is; nor from what is not, for the nonexistent cannot generate anything. **~Georgias**

In other words, nothing can come from nothing.  The <u>tholonic</u> model, as will be explained in painful detail, is exactly the opposite: everything comes from nothing.  Ironically, the <u>tholonic</u> model uses many of the same arguments and reasoning as Parmenides.

#### **Key 57:** All <u>information</u> is hierarchical.

Needless to say, there has been a lot of discussing, researching, and testing over the past thousands of years on the best way to organize “that which is”.

## Holarchies

In 1972, <u>Ervin Laszlo</u>, philosopher, theorist and two-time Nobel Prize nominee, published “<u>Evolutionary</u> Systems Theory.  Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought”.[^47]In that book, he incorporates *Living Systems Theory* and the <u>hierarchical</u> <u>structures</u> of <u>Mario Bunge</u>, an Argentine philosopher and physicist and a giant in the <u>field</u> of <u>semantics</u>, ontology, epistemology, philosophy of <u>science</u> and ethics, and recipient of twenty-one honorary doctorates and four honorary professorships by universities from the Americas (North and South) and Europe.

[^47]: Laszlo, E., & Clark, J.  W.  (1973).  **Introduction to systems philosophy: Toward a new paradigm of contemporary thought**.  New York, NY: Harper Torchbooks.  ISBN: 0061317624 (ISBN13: 9780061317620)

Laszlo’s challenge was to provide a framework for <u>understanding</u> universal <u>structures</u> that span the scopes of subatomic <u>physics</u>, through <u>biology</u>, chemistry, organisms, and social systems to the cosmos.  Laszlo describes a <u>hierarchical</u> model of interconnected <u>conceptual</u> entities.  When one of these entities is acting as a *part* of a larger entity, it is called a *<u>parton</u>*, and when acting as a *whole* entity with its own parts, or *<u>partons</u>*, it is called a *holon*.

<img src='../Images/033-embeddedholons.png' style='float:right;width:32%'/>The *holon* represents the *wholeness of its nature*, and the *parton* represents an integrated *part* of the greater *holon*.  The hierarchical ordering of *holon/partons* is called a *holarchy*.  An example of this is the biological cell mentioned previously.  The cell itself would be a *holon*.  The transcoder and other components necessary for the cell to function would be considered *partons*.  Likewise, the transcoder is also a *holon* with its component *partons*, and the cell itself is a *parton* to, say, an organ.  This makes the holarchy fractal in nature as the structure of the entire hierarchy is self-replicated in each of the holons.

The most fundamental properties of a holons are:

- Each holon has its own set of parameters, <u>laws</u>, and context.
- A holon has the ability to spawn new holons as partons.

- Holons, or <u>archetypes</u>, are interdependent on one another, as well as independent.

#### **Key 58:** The <u>structure</u> of <u>information</u> is <u>fractal</u> (self-similar and redundant)

The <u>holarchy</u> is meant to be a map of all the <u>concepts</u> of <u>archetypes</u> we have collected and it attempts to organize these <u>concepts</u> in a <u>hierarchical</u> fashion where each <u>parton</u> is a child of a holon.  Here we apply our <u>concept</u> of a <u>scope</u> as each parent has properties that the child inherits, i.e, within the holon of *person,* you will only find *person* things and not *<u>planet</u>* things.  Each holon then has a unique <u>scope</u>, and this <u>scope</u> is what defines the spectrum of possibilities for the <u>partons</u> of that holon. Now that we have a <u>scope</u>, we can also apply the <u>Bell curve</u> of probability for any particular holon.  

<center><img src='../Images/029-holarchy.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The graphs above represent a very small subsection of the Grand <u>Holarchy</u> of Everything.  The chart on the left shows a larger picture of how <u>partons</u> and holons relate to one another.  The chart on the right shows one of the many paths that connects <u>subatomic particles</u> to the multiverse.  

With a few tweaks to the previous *Super-Duper Graph of <u>Reality</u>* <u>Bell curve</u> and using a log scale rather that a linear scale, the <u>concepts</u> used in the above <u>holarchy</u> fits nicely.

<center><img src='../Images/030-supercurve2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Some readers may be thinking “Hey, wait a minute” those aren’t the same axis! What kind of Gaussian goofiness is going on here?” Well, that is partly true.  The first *Super-Duper Graph of <u>Reality</u>* chart shows the probability (x-axis) of where <u>order</u> (y-axis) will be more likely to emerge across the entire spectrum of <u>existence</u> while this one is limited to the spectrum of human perception.

If we assume that our perceptions of <u>reality</u> are fairly compatible with <u>reality</u> as it actually exists (with all due respect to <u>Parmenides</u>) , then, as probability would have it, we <u>humans</u> happen to be in the part of the spectrum where one would most expect to find <u>life</u> popping up, so, congratulations to us, we’re where we are supposed to be&hellip; probably.

Because the peak of the curve represents where the most “<u>work</u>” will be done (given the two poles that define the limits of the curve), it is also where <u>energy</u> will most likely be able to form <u>sustainable</u> patterns.  The peak of the curve also represents the most efficient expression of a holon’s purpose and function.  If we were <u>electrons</u> instead of <u>humans</u>, our archetypal holon would have the <u>electron</u> in the center, because, as the <u>electron</u> *does* exist, it would naturally occupy that point where its <u>existence</u> is most likely in the peak of the curve for the <u>electron</u> holon.  However, because <u>life</u> forms will tend to exist in the peak of the curve that spans from <u>quark</u> to <u>multiverse</u>, perhaps we can speculate that <u>life</u> itself, and the <u>consciousness</u> that evolved from <u>life</u>, to be a very efficient expression of energy.  This is not to say that there are no other forms of <u>life</u> that may excel in this regard, especially where radically different contexts may apply, but if there are other forms of <u>life</u> in our corner of the <u>Universe</u>, they will most likely appear within the same range of the curve.  More then appearing in the same area of the curve, they will probably appear similar to earthly <u>life</u> forms.  If the <u>aliens</u> ever land a UFO in Central Park, we will all be surprised, and a bit disappointed I suspect, when what emerges looks like a customer service representative from Best Buy or otherwise unimpressively human.  At least that is the opinion of an University of Edinburgh's Astrobiology professor Charles S. Cockell, as he spells out in his book *The Equations of Life: How <u>Physics</u> Shapes <u>Evolution</u>*.  However, by his same reasoning, there is a good chance it could look like some of our own highly successful <u>life</u> forms, such as lice, crocodiles, duck-billed platypuses, horseshoe crabs, immortal jellyfish, or the highly intelligent octopus, to name a few.

<center><img src='../Images/aliens.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Human-looking or not, all creations are subject to the three attributes of the <u>holarchy</u> as noted above; **<u>negotiation</u>** (cooperation or conflict), **definition** (limitations of environment and resources), and **<u>contribution</u>** (maintenance of <u>sustainability</u>).  Oxford University’s <u>evolutionary</u> biologist Sam Levin sums this idea up quite well in his paper “Darwin’s <u>Aliens</u>”:

>[Aliens, like humans] are made-up of a <u>hierarchy</u> of entities, which all cooperate to produce a [lifeform].  At each level of the organism there will be mechanisms in place to eliminate conflict, maintain cooperation, and keep the organism functioning.   We should expect [aliens] to have been favoured by similarly restrictive conditions [as us humans]. Thus, we can make specific predictions about the biological makeup of complex aliens.  [^48]

We take the position that it is these same forces that apply to all <u>existence</u>, not simply biological life.

Another excellent example of both a <u>holarchy</u> and its self-similar <u>nature</u> is that of the neurological <u>structure</u> of the <u>brain</u>’s processing ability along with the <u>structure</u> of <u>language</u> that evolved out of that structure.  This also shows examples of the various scopes through which instances are expressed.  The 1<sup>st</sup> column on the left is a <u>hierarchical</u> <u>structure</u> of a sentence. The 2<sup>nd</sup> column shows the speed at which each part of the <u>hierarchy</u> is processed by the brain. The 3<sup>rd</sup> column shows what (proposed) part of the <u>brain</u> is <u>contributing</u> to the overall process, and the 4<sup>th</sup> column shows the <u>scope</u> and size of that part of the brain.

## <u>Memes</u>

More recently, this holarchical model was applied to Richard <u>Dawkins</u> <u>concept</u> of a *<u>meme</u>*[^49].  A <u>meme</u> is defined as:

> an element of a <u>culture</u> or system of behavior passed from one individual to another by imitation or other non-genetic means.

In <u>Dawkins</u> own words[^50] :

> “<u>Memes</u> spread through the <u>culture</u> like genes spread through the gene pool”

<center><img src='../Images/032-holongrid.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

[^49]: Dawkins, C.  R.  (2016).  **The selfish gene**.  Oxford: Oxford University Press.
[^50]: **Just for Hits - Richard Dawkins**.  (2013, June 22).  <https://youtu.be/GFn-ixX9edg>The first 4 minutes is an excellent overview of memes by Dawkins.  The following 4 minutes is a sort of meme-ish music video which is a bit odd, but also a bit entertaining


This is relevant as it demonstrates how the <u>concept</u> of a <u>meme</u> is incorporated into a holarchy.  The original version of the  chart above comes from a paper on video games and their <u>potential</u> to increase intelligence.[^51] The part that is interesting is how Velikovsky puts the <u>meme</u> at the bottom of the <u>cultural</u> branch.  It is interesting because it defines a <u>meme</u> as a seventh-generation descendant component part, a particle, so to speak, of the *uber* <u>concept</u> of *<u>culture</u>*.  The <u>meme</u> here is analogous to what the <u>electron</u> is to the <u>atom</u>, or the <u>atom</u> to the molecule, or the molecule to the object.  He also puts *<u>ideas</u>* down there as well, which may be consistent with the way he is defining an idea.  In our case, we are defining *<u>Ideas</u>* (capital “I”), like forms, as the archetypal blueprint for many instances of ideas.  The idea of *“Let’s make a video game where people have to shoot each other”* is an instance of the archetypal Idea *“Individual or tribal <u>competition</u> and survival”*, which also spawns such <u>concepts</u> as sports, war, predatory capitalism, the idea of winning, etc.  The idea of *“If I sin, I will burn in hell”*, a very resilient and popular <u>meme</u> for thousands of years, is an instance of the archetypal Idea *“We are judged harshly by our superiors for being self-serving”*, which spawn such <u>concepts</u> as karma, judgment day, guilt, original sin, etc.

[^51]: Velikovsky, J.  T.  (1970, January 01).  **Flow Theory, Evolution & Creativity: Or, Fun & Games ** <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2677770>

The <u>holarchy</u> examples shown above are portrayed as 2-dimensional bifurcating trees, but this model hides a lot of <u>information</u>, for if we zoomed in, we would see that within each holon is a collection of holons that share an idea, purpose, function, etc.  Each holon has its own parameters, <u>laws</u>, context, etc., and each holon, therefore, has its own <u>Bell curve</u> that shows where it is best suited to “<u>work</u>”, such as the <u>Bell curve</u> of the human eye sensitivity, which would be one holon of “human eye”.

For consistency, here is the human eye sensitivity chart which represents one aspect of a holon of *human eye* in the *bio* branch of the <u>holarchy</u>, and it’s natural <u>Bell curve</u> of efficiency, or “<u>work</u>”.

<center><img src='../Images/031-eyecurve2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

These Bell curves of probability are not shown, or even defined, in the holarchic model.  The reason for that is because the holarchic model does not have the explicit concept of a duality, though it implies them.  As a result, the holarchy cannot show how the Bell curve of a holon is made up of the integrated aggregate of the Bell curves of its partons within the context of the holon.  <img src='../Images/2earths.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>It does show the parameters of the holon are defined by its parent, but the ultimate parent of the holarchy is the Multiverse, which is, in our view, the “bottom” of the hierarchy of reality as we know it as, and the “seed” of of the *tree of reality* begins with the first and smallest particle.  In some way, this is like arguing which is the “correct” way to view Earth, north at the “top”, or south at the “top”, but it does play an important role a little later.

What happens if we incorporate the idea of dualities into the <u>holarchy</u>?  Let’s see, but first let’s look at some important <u>concepts</u> behind *<u>structure</u>*.
