We know a lot about <u>fields</u> already, so it is reasonable to examine <u>fields</u> in general based on what we have learned.  For example, if we use the <u>concepts</u> used in <u>electricity</u>, we can speculate the following as a starting point.

- <img src='../Images/emfields.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>**A field is composed of two parts that are always perpendicular to each other .** One part, the electric field, is the result of potential energy or the position of the charges, and one part, the magnetic field, is the result of kinetic energy, or the movement of the charges, so we have a concept of a "potential field" and the "kinetic field".  The electrical field is created by voltage (potential), or charge, and exists even if there is no movement of energy.  The magnetic field is created by current or amperage (kinetic), and only exists where there is a flow of energy.
- **<u>Potential</u> <u>fields</u> can perform "<u>work</u>"** as they can change the state of matter.  This is based on the fact that electrical <u>fields</u> can alter the speed and direction of matter.
- **<u>Kinetic</u> <u>fields</u> (may) carry <u>information</u> and cannot perform <u>work</u>** as they do not affect the state of matter.  This is based on the fact that the state of matter, such as its speed and direction, is unaffected by a <u>magnetic</u> field.  Because we have stated that <u>information</u> is <u>data</u> plus <u>energy</u>, which implies <u>movement</u>, and because the <u>kinetic</u> <u>field</u> is the result of the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>, we can suggest that the <u>kinetic</u> <u>field</u> contains information.
- **These <u>fields</u> <u>transmit</u> <u>energy</u> through waves.**  We say this because <u>electrons</u> are not the <u>energy</u> itself; they are the medium through which <u>energy</u> is transported.  So, where is the actual <u>energy</u>?  It is in the <u>field</u> that surrounds the medium, such as a wire.  These <u>energy</u> <u>fields</u> travel *through* the <u>electrons</u> in the wire, not *on* them, at the speed of light.  It's similar to the way <u>waves</u> are created when you drop a rock into the water.  The <u>waves</u> travel outward at some speed, but the water <u>molecules</u> are not traveling outward at that speed; rather, they are just bobbing up and down as a result of the <u>energy</u> <u>wave</u> traveling *through* the water.  In this example,  <u>electrons</u> are like water <u>molecules</u>, water is like the electromagnetic <u>field</u>, the container of the water is like the wires, and dropping a rock is like flipping the "On" switch. 
- **The transmission of <u>energy</u> requires a disturbance to the fields.** Just as the rock in the above example created a disturbance in the water by the release of <u>energy</u>, the release of <u>energy</u> by closing a circuit causes a disturbance in the electromagnetic field.  In the case of <u>electricity</u>, the <u>waves</u> always travel at the <u>speed of light</u>, unlike the water <u>waves</u>, which move at a speed relative to the size and velocity of the rock.  This is because there is no matter to factor in with electromagnetic fields.
- **The material used to conduct these <u>fields</u> can be any material that responds to the <u>energy</u> carried by the field.** <u>Energy</u> causes things to move, and it will always seek to dissipate/balance itself in those things.  This is that "path of least <u>resistance</u>" stuff again.  If it is easier to move an <u>electron</u> in a copper wire than it is to move an <u>electron</u> in nitrogen-filled air, then that is what it will do, and that is why wires work.  The <u>energy</u> itself, including any <u>information</u> it may contain, is carried in the electromagnetic <u>fields</u>, and the wires are used to direct the flow of those fields.  <u>Fields</u> don't need wires to travel as they can travel through the air, water, or even space, but it is very difficult to control and direct the <u>fields</u> in these mediums.  This also applies to the <u>energy</u> of <u>ideas</u> and <u>concepts</u> and their conductive medium, the mind.
- **The conductive material is simply a means to move the <u>energy</u> and is not altered (much) by the <u>energy</u> (within the limits of the capacity of the material).** When <u>electricity</u> moves through a wire, the <u>electrons</u> only move about 1/10 of a millimeter per second in a DC current.  In an AC current, they jiggle back and forth 60 times a second. 
- **<u>Fields</u> contain embedded fields.** The idea is derived from the observation that a <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u> can exist with the <u>movement</u> of a local energy.  For example, a static <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u> can be created by the <u>movement</u> of <u>subatomic particles</u> (electrons, <u>protons</u>, <u>neutrons</u>) called “spin”.  Everything is <u>magnetic</u> but in most substances the direction of the spin of these particles is 50/50, half spinning in one direction, and half spinning in the opposite direction, so the <u>magnetic</u> <u>fields</u> <u>balance</u> each other out.  In some metals, like iron, all the particles spin in the same direction, creating an imbalanced <u>magnetic</u> field.  It is the attempt of this imbalanced <u>field</u> to <u>balance</u> itself that creates <u>magnetic</u> <u>fields</u> we see in <u>magnets</u>, <u>planets</u> and elsewhere.  We call this an embedded <u>field</u> because it is a <u>field</u> that exist on a more fundamental level than that of <u>electricity</u>, and even when there is no <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u> on the circuit level, there are countless <u>magnetic</u> <u>fields</u> in play at the subatomic level. 

The most important point is that <u>energy</u> travels via fields.  This is true even in the case of <u>electricity</u>, even though “common sense” tells us the <u>energy</u> is traveling through the wires.  Wires simply allow for the direction of the fields.  When we use Ohm’s <u>law</u> or even Newton's <u>laws</u>, we are describing relationships that are caused by fields.  Even <u>mass</u> itself can be described as a product of <u>field</u> interactions if we consider <u>waves</u> as the result of <u>energy</u> traveling through a <u>field</u> (which is how <u>quantum mechanics</u> defines it).  In fact, <u>mass</u> itself may simply be a measure of the <u>energy</u> of a wave.[^346]

#### **Key 72:** <u>Fields</u> are the context for the <u>energy</u> that creates <u>waves</u>, and everything is a wave.



With all the above in mind, lets explore <u>tholonic</u> fields.

If <u>tholons</u> are themselves forms of <u>information</u>, then we come back to the question, “Where is this <u>information</u> stored?” This is a question that has been pondered for ages. One example would be the somewhat <u>Buddhist</u> <u>concept</u> (in that it was coined by a <u>Buddhist</u> in 1884, but adopted by other beliefs) called the *Akashic Records* which is said to be “a compendium of all human events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future”. This might be a bit ambitious for our purposes, but the idea is essentially the same… that of a ubiquitous, timeless non-physical record of (at least) all <u>aggregate</u> thought forms. If our claim is that this also describes the thologram, then where and how does it store this <u>data</u>?

Let’s review…

Our claim that the original source of <u>energy</u> is primal <u>Awareness</u> and <u>Intention</u>, and as such, <u>Awareness</u> and <u>Intention</u> is a property of existence.  This is consistent with some current scientific models, especially in light of the experiments that have shown an inextricable relationship between <u>reality</u> and awareness.  Although there is much discussion these days about <u>consciousness</u> and <u>reality</u>, Archibald <u>Wheeler</u>, one of the mega-heavy-weights of <u>quantum mechanics</u>, a colleague of Albert <u>Einstein</u> and Niels <u>Bohr</u>, a mentor to many of today’s Leading physicists, and the man who chose the name “<u>black hole</u>,” was perhaps the first modern scientist to prove that <u>awareness</u> is required to bring the <u>Universe</u> into existence.

As <u>Wheeler</u> put it:  

> No phenomenon is a real phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon.[^321] We are participants in bringing into being not only the near and here, but the far away and long ago.[^324]

Towards the end of his <u>life</u>, he said he had only enough time left to <u>work</u> on one idea: that **<u>awareness</u> shapes not only the present but the past as well.**

<center><img src='../Images/099-splitslit.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

We already have the proof of <u>awareness</u> causing <u>waveforms</u> to collapse into particles, as we can see in the _split-slit_ experiment.

Briefly, this split-slit experiment shows that when observed, <u>electrons</u> act like particles, and when not observed, they act like waves.  The act of observation forces the <u>electron</u> <u>waves</u> to be perceived as particles.  It’s not that the <u>electrons</u> are <u>waves</u> that turn into particles; it’s that the <u>electrons</u> are *wavicles*, both particles *and* <u>waves</u> at the same time, but the act of observing them, of introducing <u>awareness</u> into the context, changes the context and <u>scope</u> of the expression, which then alters its instantiation.  It was stated earlier that the <u>archetype</u> of something and its instance are the same thing in different contexts.  Here, the “<u>wave</u>” quality of an <u>electron</u> is the <u>archetype</u>, as it defines its <u>field</u> and its probabilities.  Once the <u>field</u> interacts with another <u>field</u>, i.e is observed, its context changes.  It’s like the difference between having credit and making a purchase. Having credit means you have the <u>potential</u> to buy something.  If you are in a shoe store, there is a high probability you will buy shoes. You may have the idea to buy red shoes (the <u>archetype</u>), but you don’t know exactly what red shoes you will buy until you are holding a pair in your hands (the instance of the <u>archetype</u>) and the transaction is approved.

We also have evidence of how <u>awareness</u> can (possibly) change the <u>reality</u> of the past as well, as demonstrated in <u>Wheeler</u>’s *<u>delayed-choice experiment</u>*[^324].  In addition, <u>Penrose</u> wrote an entire book on the subject of cognition and <u>reality</u> (*The Emperors’  New Mind*).  He even came up with a term do describe the awareness/reality continuum: the _Orch-OR_[^326], or *orchestrated objective reduction*, which attempts to explain how <u>consciousness</u> and <u>reality</u> are intertwined.  The idea of <u>reality</u> being a product of <u>awareness</u> is not at all “fringe” and hasn’t been for some time.

[^326]: **“Consciousness in the Universe: A Review of the “Orch OR” Theory.”** Physics of Life Reviews. Elsevier, August 20, 2013. <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064513001188?via=ihub>.

Looking at this <u>tholonically</u>, each <u>tholon</u> has its own <u>field</u>, and that <u>field</u> is a parent <u>field</u> within which the child <u>tholons</u>, with their own subfields, are created.

We noted how <u>magnetic</u> <u>fields</u> can be created by the <u>movement</u> of energy\.  These <u>magnetic</u> <u>fields</u> are a form of <u>energy</u>, so just as the <u>movement</u> of <u>electricity</u> can form a <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u>, so too can a <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u> form electricity.  No <u>energy</u> is being created, just changed from one form to another form.  This transformation, specifically in the case of <u>electricity</u> and <u>magnetism</u>, is called *<u>induction</u>*.  As the word implies, <u>induction</u> is the “*ability to persuade or influence (someone or something) to do something.*”  Thus, every <u>field</u>, at every level,  can induce anything in its proximity to change in some way and to some degree.

Applying this to the thologram, at the “top” we have a very simple <u>field</u>, which exists between the 1<sup>st</sup> two poles created by the primal dot and which have the properties we have labeled *<u>Definiton</u>* and *<u>Contribution</u>*, and which instantiates in various forms depending on their context. Every child <u>field</u> is induced by its parent (and ancestors and peers), and the parent is induced by the child (and all descendants, and peers).  Thus, the thologram is one large <u>field</u> of ever-embedded <u>fields</u> all inducing one another, all of which are expressions of the primal <u>awareness</u>, all of which are interacting with, and dependent on, one another.

There are many legends, stories and theories, ancient and modern, attesting to the power of awareness.  We won’t get into them here other than to say that if <u>reality</u> and <u>awareness</u> are intertwined, then it would be reasonable to expect that just as <u>reality</u> has an effect on <u>awareness</u>, <u>awareness</u> can have an effect on <u>reality</u>, especially as <u>awareness</u> is an integral part of <u>reality</u> and not simply an effect of <u>evolutionary</u> causes.  This is easier to accept when speaking of human <u>awareness</u>, but how does this associative relationship manifest in other instances, such as plants, rocks, <u>planets</u> and elements, all of which are some expression of the primal <u>awareness</u> to begin with?

## Morphic-Fields

As late as the 1950s, some scientists and most people in general thought that plants and even animals were little more than biological machines and that outer-space was just a bunch of hot and cold balls floating around according to Newtonian and Keplerian laws.  Since then we have come to discover that plants have “feelings”, <u>monkeys</u> can form sentences and talk about their emotions, the <u>Universe</u> is not only a lot bigger than we thought, but there may be countless parallel versions of them.  We have seen how everything is connected in one way or another, at least on the quantum level - just to name a few of the changes to our worldview.  We are moving ahead in our thinking and <u>understanding</u> at an incredible rate.

Sadly, some of the old guard is a tough bunch that is doing their best to keep us from making progress, not unlike the 9<sup>th</sup> century Archdiocese.  Take the long-time editor of *<u>Nature</u>* magazine, John <u>Maddox</u>, who stated, regarding <u>Rupert Sheldrake</u>’s book on morphic-fields:

> [his book] is the best candidate for burning there has been for many years.  Sheldrake’s is not a scientific theory.  Sheldrake is putting forward magic instead of <u>science</u>, and that can be condemned, in exactly the <u>language</u> that the Pope used to condemn <u>Galileo</u>, and for the same reasons: it is heresy.[^93]

[^93]: Media, T. E. (2015, June 02). Rupert Sheldrake, **Heretic**. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSd4DA5xhHw>

Yes, he actually cited <u>Pope Paul V</u>’s condemnation of <u>Galileo</u> as a <u>defense</u> on the grounds that *heresy* is the real crime.  This sounds eerily similar to “swarming with worms of heretical perversity.”

This alone should paint a pretty clear picture that modern <u>science</u>, for all its breakthroughs in <u>understanding</u> and progress, has become a modern-day <u>religion</u> in the hands of the truly dogmatic that seem to be in charge all too often.  Dr.  Richard <u>Feynman</u> himself noted this when he stated:

> We live in an unscientific age in which almost all the buffeting of communications and television, words, books, and so on, are unscientific.  As a result, there is a considerable amount of intellectual tyranny in the name of science.[^94]

So, why are the modern-day versions of <u>Tomás de Torquemada</u> (Grand Inquisitor in the <u>Spanish Inquisition</u> of the 15<sup>th</sup> Century) and his ilk, impaling the venerable and brilliant <u>Rupert Sheldrake</u> on the spikes of modern mainstream scientific dogma? Well, it seems that Sheldrake, himself a Cambridge professor who studied at Harvard, was onto something with his *<u>Morphic-Field</u> Theory*, and it rattled their cage.  Perhaps they feared that the “worms of heretical perversity” would begin to devour the carcass of their dying scientific worldview.

Sheldrake’s <u>Morphic-Field</u> Theory, which he described in his 1981 book, *A New <u>Science</u> of <u>Life</u>*, posits the <u>existence</u> of organizing <u>fields</u> which are systems that <u>self-organize</u>, create <u>structure</u>, and have patterns.  Morphic-fields are not a type of <u>mass</u> nor an <u>energy</u> but are organized *by* <u>energy</u>, like everything else.  Morphic-fields are described in the same way as holarchies in that they are made up of parts, which are in turn parts of wholes themselves.  At each level, the <u>morphic-field</u> supports the <u>structure</u> of its whole and organizes its parts.

Morphic-fields described  (in 50 words):

> &hellip;located invisibly in and around organisms, and may account for such hitherto unexplainable phenomena as the regeneration of severed limbs by worms and salamanders, phantom limbs, the <u>holographic</u> properties of <u>memory</u>, <u>telepathy</u>, and the increasing ease with which new skills are learned as greater quantities of a population acquire them.[^95]  **\~Rupert Sheldrake**

[^95]: Sheldrake, Rupert. **A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Formative Causation**. Los Angeles: J.P. Tarcher, 1981.

A more complete description is:

> A <u>morphic-field</u> (MF) is a <u>field</u> of <u>energy</u> that imposes <u>patterns</u> on otherwise <u>random</u> or indeterminate <u>patterns</u> of activity.  Morphic-fields <u>transmit</u> <u>information</u> via <u>morphic-resonance</u> (MR), which is the influence of previous <u>structures</u> of activity on subsequent similar <u>structures</u> of activity organized by morphic-fields.  MR has the capacity to store and <u>transmit</u> <u>information</u> and therefore it can act as a <u>memory</u> bank for any <u>self-organizing</u> group, such as <u>self-organizing</u> systems; <u>molecules</u>, <u>crystals</u>, <u>cells</u>, plants, animals and animal societies.  Each member of a group can <u>contribute</u> and draw from this <u>memory</u> bank. **~ excerpt from <u>Rupert Sheldrake</u>’s letter to <u>John Horgan</u>, writer for Scientific American**[^96]<sup>,</sup>[^97]

The idea of MFs was an epiphany that Sheldrake had in 1971 as a way to explain how living things knew how to grow when that <u>information</u> was not stored in its genes.

The very first known example of an MF test actually goes back to 1920, long before the <u>ideas</u> of MF arrived, when Harvard professor <u>William McDougall</u> proved that children of mice that have learned a maze can navigate the maze much faster.  After 20 generations of maze running mice, the next generation was able to run the maze 10 times faster than their pioneering ancestors.  As genetics could not account for this transference of <u>knowledge</u>, it must have been something else, something <u>science</u> didn’t know about.  To investigate this mystery, a team in Edinburgh set out to prove McDougall’s test was pure poppycock.  Unfortunately for these researchers, their 20<sup>th</sup> generation mice knew how to go straight to the target on the first try.

They had no idea of morphic-fields back then because if they did, they would have known that the Edinburgh mice benefited from the <u>knowledge</u> of the Harvard mice, even though they were thousands of miles apart, thanks to the transference of <u>information</u> via the MF/MR.  There have been many other examples like this over the last 100 years.

The way this MF <u>information</u> is <u>transmitted</u> is via MR, according to Sheldrake.  All members of a group that share an MF have access to the MF info because they naturally resonate with that <u>field</u>, not unlike how we can pick up radio <u>waves</u> when we have a <u>crystal</u> that resonates with the transmission frequency.  <u>Dogs</u> share <u>information</u> with <u>dogs</u>, <u>humans</u> with <u>humans</u>, etc., but a bond between a dog and a human creates another MF that they both share.  Sheldrake shows examples of this in how <u>dogs</u> know when their owners are coming home and start waiting for them by a door or window.[^98]<sup>,</sup>[^99]

[^99]: One of these experiments can be seen here: <http://www.sheldrake.org/videos/jaytee-a-dog-who-knew-when-his-owner-was-coming-home-the-orf-experiment>

Because of their ability to <u>transmit</u> <u>data</u> across time and space, MFs have been considered for communication in long-distance and interstellar travel[^100]<sup>,</sup>[^101].  MFs may also be capable of creating <u>self-organizing</u> systems within the realm of AI.

A lot more research is needed in the area of MF and MR, but this is slow in coming given the oppressive dogma of modern science.[^102] Others have been working on similar <u>ideas</u>, such as theoretical physicist <u>Lee Smolin</u>, with his idea of the *principle of precedence*[^103], which states that the history of measuring a particular quantum event will determine (or affect) the future measurements of that same event when it is measured.  Unfortunately, unlike the world of <u>physics</u>, <u>biology</u> has become more dogmatic in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

One small detail, but hugely significant, is that morphic-fields originate outside of space-time.  They exist in the realm of thought, or <u>awareness</u>, or <u>consciousness</u> (or all three).  <u>Information</u>, as we currently understand it, cannot travel faster than the <u>speed of light</u> (in the 3D <u>reality</u>) but does this apply to <u>awareness</u>? According to the <u>tholon</u> model, no, it does not, because <u>reality</u> and the <u>Universe</u> *is* <u>awareness</u>, and <u>awareness</u> is 0-dimensional, and therefore transcends the <u>limitations</u> of space-time. There has been some research on <u>awareness</u> and morphic-fields[^104], but it’s scant, and the results are far from clear-cut.

## Beyond the Body

Many people believe that one’s <u>awareness</u> can, with practice, travel outside of the body, and outside of this physical reality.  This is typically called an *Out of Body Experience* (OOBE), or *Astral Projection*.  Mainstream <u>science</u> is not a fan of this idea.  *Scientific American* suggests that OOBEs are caused by inner ear problems[^105].  This view, although not surprising, is disconcerting considering that some real research on OOBEs has shown remarkable evidence.  There are many examples of such research[^106], such as <u>Dr.  Tart</u>’s subject being able to read the letters “P = 10<sup>-5</sup>” or “25132” that were written on a remote piece of paper while out-of-body[^107].  Practitioners have reported faster-than-light, instantaneous, “travel”, which would be possible in the 0-dimensional space of Awareness.

[^106]: <https://www.iacworld.org/evidence-for-out-of-body-experience-as-a-real-or-veridical-phenomenon>
[^107]: The full account of his research and notes are reprinted at <http://www.aura-oasis.be/website/scientific-research-on-out-of-the-body-experiences>


<u>Tholonically</u> speaking, OOBEs are not just possible, they are inevitable. The <u>concept</u> of “<u>soul</u>” is an umbrella term to describe “ancestor” <u>tholons</u>, or the <u>tholons</u> that we emerged from.  Adepts at <u>consciousness</u> anchoring can anchor to any tholon.  This might explain how, as it says in the <u>Majjhima Nikāya scripture</u>, it was possible for <u>Buddha</u> to remember all his lives going back 90 eons, (with 1 eon being the lifespan of the solar system).

Although this sort of research does not get the attention it deserves, with a bit of <u>effort</u> it can be found.  <u>Science</u> is not well equipped to study the mechanics of <u>awareness</u> or any non-material phenomena.

<u>Fields</u> of <u>awareness</u>, such as morphic-fields and <u>tholonic</u> <u>fields</u>, while being able to instantiate in the material world, are not limited to the restrictions of the material world, and it is inevitable that we, as instances of <u>awareness</u>, will discover them.

#### **Key 73:** <u>Tholonic</u> and Morphic-fields have the ability to <u>transmit</u> and store information.
#### **Key 74:** Tholonic-fields are not limited by time and space.

## Tholonic-Fields

The current idea that MFs can be formed as a result of a <u>self-organizing</u> system, as Sheldrake describes them, are limited to systems that exist, systems that have real-world instances, such as <u>species</u>, societies, etc. <u>Ideas</u> exist and are <u>self-organizing</u> as well, so why wouldn’t MFs apply there? Well, they would, but with a difference.  In the MF model, it is the instantiated members of  the MF that are receivers and <u>transmitters</u> of <u>information</u>, and therefore the reception and transmission of <u>information</u> among the living are dependent on the ability of the members of the over 200,000,000 <u>species</u> of <u>life</u> on the <u>planet</u> to <u>transmit</u> and receive.  If we applied the MF model to <u>ideas</u> as <u>archetypes</u> not limited by their instances, than what is receiving/transmitting <u>information</u> in this MF that *<u>ideas</u>* are a member of?

Sheldrake implicitly answers this question when he describes the <u>morphic-field</u> as “*organizing <u>fields</u> which are systems that <u>self-organize</u>, create <u>structure</u>, and have <u>patterns</u>*”.  This description is that of a form of <u>intelligence</u>, and therefore the morphic-fields that share a <u>morphic-resonance</u> or morphic cloud are capable of <u>transmitting</u> and receiving between themselves, not only with their instances.  <u>Tholonically</u> speaking, this would also mean that the <u>archetypes</u>, the <u>tholons</u>, are also both <u>transmitters</u> and receivers of information.  The <u>tholonic</u> view also considers the material <u>reality</u> to be a contextual expression of a <u>field</u> in the material <u>reality</u>, and there is no difference between the <u>field</u> and the form other than context, as they are the same thing. In the MF model, <u>humans</u>, <u>dogs</u>, and <u>ants</u> are forms of <u>life</u> that resonate with fields. In the <u>tholonic</u> model, <u>humans</u>, <u>dogs</u>, and <u>ants</u> *are* those <u>fields</u> in a material context.

The theory of Morphic-Fields attempts to explain why and how <u>ideas</u> simultaneously spread across a morphic group, such as humans.  Examples of this are how Leibniz and Newton both came up with the idea of calculus at the same time, or how cubic equations, considered to be one of the greatest milestones in mathematics history, was simultaneously discovered by <u>Nicola Tartaglia</u> and <u>Scipione del Ferro</u> in the 16<sup>th</sup> century.  Morphic-fields are also capable of inter-group communication, such as between <u>humans</u> and <u>dogs</u>, as cited in Sheldrake’s book *“<u>Dogs</u> That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home*”.

In the <u>tholonic</u> view, these same phenomena exist between <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetypes</u>, and these tholons/archetypes can have direct communication with each other without having to go through any of their instances.  That interaction can also include <u>negotiation</u> via cooperation and/or conflict, or result in a redefining or <u>contributing</u> of both archetypes.  <u>Tholons</u> can battle, join together, form alliances, trade, aid, lie, extort, and even destroy other tholons.  This <u>understanding</u> does a better job explaining the wasp/roach or honeybee/human relationship, but also sheds light on everything from <u>religion</u> to economics.  

At the time of this writing (August, 2020), within the social arena, which includes <u>economics</u>, <u>politics</u>, <u>government</u>, <u>culture</u>, civil rights, and so much more, we are seeing some extraordinary <u>movement</u> of <u>tholonic</u> activity in the social realm as a result of the global pandemic and subsequent lock-down, itself a creation of a <u>tholonic</u> <u>intention</u>, which will alter all aspects of society.  As the activity increases, a wider array of <u>tholons</u> will be <u>contributing</u> to the cause and effect of the situation-at-large to the point where <u>concepts</u> unrelated to <u>health</u>, <u>government</u>, and <u>economics</u> will come into play and be changed in ways we may not be able to imagine.  Of course, what we are seeing today is itself a child of the changes that have been happening for hundreds, and even thousands of years.  It might seem obvious that events like famine, war, or <u>disease</u> would be very disruptive.  While that is true for us poor human instances, on the <u>tholonic</u> level, they are business-as-usual.  Far more disruptive (on the <u>tholonic</u> level) are the new classes of <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetypes</u> that never existed before and are changing reality.  Some example of these more recent <u>archetypes</u> might be:  

- The discovery of quantum phenomena (1801).
- Nuclear <u>fission</u> and <u>fusion</u> (late 1930s, early 1940s).
- The invention of digital <u>information</u> (1948).
- The invention of genetic engineering (1970s).
- Quantum Computing, <u>AI</u>, genetic technology, and similar bleeding-edge changes will be added to this list.

These are just some of the changes that have, and will, permanently and radically alter the direction of growth for many <u>archetypes</u> and their instances, and consequently, the fabric of <u>reality</u> and our <u>understanding</u> and perception of it.

It is a small step from here to presume that with even a little <u>understanding</u> of <u>reality</u>, the <u>tholonic</u> model could easily “predict” future discoveries.  This has already happened to some degree.  In one of the numerous cases of self-learning <u>AI</u>, the <u>AI</u> agent scanning only the words (which are themselves <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetypes</u>) of documents combined the <u>concepts</u> of  “chalcogenid”, “optoelectronic”, and “photovoltaic applications” to create a new <u>concept</u> of a thermometric <u>archetype</u> that the <u>AI</u> identified as *CsAgGa<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>*[^108].  That was in 2009.  In 2012, that compound was discovered.

## <u>Ideas</u>

The natural ordering as a result of the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> is obvious (we hope), but for this to apply to <u>ideas</u> we would have to accept that <u>ideas</u> themselves use, <u>transmit</u>, or transform energy.  There are two arguments to support that they do.

- An idea cannot exist in a state of total nothingness.  If an idea exists, then it must do so somewhere on the spectrum of some <u>duality</u>, therefore, it must have some kind of <u>energy</u> passing through it.
- An idea or <u>concept</u> has <u>coherence</u>, or low <u>entropy</u>, and represents a product of “<u>work</u>” or the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>, which produces <u>fields</u> and oscillations of that <u>energy</u>’s movement.

#### **Key 75:** Tholonic-fields are the <u>fields</u> generated by the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> through an archetypal <u>concept</u> that has been discovered or created.



Morphic-fields are the instantiations of <u>tholonic</u> <u>fields</u> as expressed by the instantiations of that archetype. This brings us back again to the question: how and where is all this <u>information</u> that is being accessed stored? How does a <u>tholon</u> know the limits of its <u>scope</u>? How does it access the <u>information</u> needed to inform its <u>intelligence</u>? How does it “remember” context or “learn”?

The first place to look for an answer is in the manner that <u>tholonic</u> instances have devised to store and <u>transmit</u> <u>information</u>, and the obvious choice of instances is *<u>humans</u>*.  If we look at how we <u>humans</u> store the <u>information</u> we have collected from the <u>conceptual</u> world we may be able to discover analogous processes that apply to the world of <u>tholonic</u> and morphic-fields.

And how *do* we store that <u>information</u>? We invent an abstract <u>symbolism</u>, apply meaning to it, call it <u>language</u>, use that <u>language</u> to record those symbols, and then, most importantly, teach our children how to decode these symbols.  This shares some similarities with the process the <u>honeybirds</u> have developed, and maybe even with the <u>dopamine</u> injecting <u>wasps</u>, but the difference is they do not (appear) to have a way of recording or sharing their <u>collective</u> <u>knowledge</u> as <u>humans</u> do.  Perhaps this is because <u>humans</u> have lost touch with this <u>information</u> <u>field</u>, as suggested by <u>Jaynes</u>, so they had to invent their own techniques like writing, talking, the Internet, cloud storage, etc.  Perhaps we may not be aware of the <u>symbolism</u> being used by our *<u>field</u> <u>intelligence</u>* to collect, store, and <u>transmit</u> <u>information</u>, or perhaps we are aware of it but don’t know how to understand it.  Because we do not know, or have not been taught how to recognize or understand these symbolic messages, we have to assume they could exist anywhere, and everywhere.

#### **Key 76:** We don’t know what we don’t know.



Let’s look at some of the more likely candidates of how and where we might find and access this *<u>field</u> intelligence.*

## <u>Telepathy</u>, <u>ESP</u>, or Something

Can we describe this <u>field</u> <u>intelligence</u> as some sort of <u>telepathy</u>? And if so, do we even have any evidence that <u>telepathy</u> exists?

The idea of <u>telepathy</u> has been around forever, but modern <u>science</u> insists it is all pseudo-science hogwash, right?

Not exactly.  Not only is there a mountain of evidence to support its <u>existence</u>[^109]<sup>,</sup>[^110]<sup>,</sup>[^111]<sup>,</sup>[^112] and even a drug named after it, *<u>telepathine</u>*[^113], but the (technology-enhanced) <u>telepathy</u> business is booming!

- Many research projects developing <u>telepathic</u> processes and products.[^114]<sup>,</sup>[^115]<sup>,</sup>[^116]
- U.S. military (DARPA) developing telepathy-based weapons.[^117]
- *Elon Musk*, Facebook, and others all developing telepathy-based tools.[^118]<sup>,</sup>[^119]<sup>,</sup>[^120]<sup>,</sup>[^121]
- <u>Google</u>’s *neuroprosthetics* (brain augmentation <u>nanobots</u>[^319]<sup>,</sup>[^318]) that will, according to their director of engineering, Ray <u>Kurzweil</u>, not only result in human <u>hybrids</u> by 2030[^316], but will “make us godlike”[^317] (we are assuming these godlike powers include <u>telepathy</u>, <u>ESP</u>, and more).

While it’s true that a lot of research and development in the area of <u>telepathy</u> is based on technology-induced <u>telepathy</u>, such as “<u>neural clouds</u>” which will be indistinguishable from current data-clouds, it is still driven by the idea of telepathy.  In other words, we have the <u>understanding</u> and belief that <u>telepathy</u> is a real phenomena that can be improved upon.

Sheldrake himself has a lot to say supporting the <u>existence</u> of some sort of <u>telepathy</u> in the documentary “*Scientific Evidence of Telepathy: Documentary.”*[^122]

[^122]: King, T. (2017, May 30). **Scientific Evidence of Telepathy - Documentary**. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ4G3IRVFwU>

<u>Russel Targ</u>, a former physicist at Stanford Research Institute and author of *“The <u>Reality</u> of ESP: A Physicist’s Proof of Psychic Abilities”*, has experimented with <u>telepathy</u> and <u>ESP</u> for some time now.  He shows[^123] that the scientific evidence for <u>ESP</u> is statistically stronger than the evidence that aspirin helps reduce stroke.  The aspirin test was so statistically significant that the test had to be called off because it was considered unethical to continue giving test subjects placebos in light of the overwhelming evidence they had collected before the test was even completed.  I know it’s a rhetorical question, but why are we not seeing this revolutionary telepathy/ESP research all over the news? The evidence is compelling enough to accept that <u>telepathy</u>, in some form, is a thing.

The umbrella “or something” category can cover quite a bit of territory, including lesser-known applications of our sensory-processing skills, such as the ability to smell personalities and emotions[^124]<sup>,</sup>[^125] or, if you’re a woman ovulating, your superhero-like ability to immediately recognize gay men and hidden snakes[^126] (the elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles, not the metaphorical type, although I suspect research would show significant results for the latter as well).  Some <u>humans</u> have a visual sense 100 times more sensitive than the average person.[^127] And what of the extensive intrinsic nervous system in the <u>heart</u> comprised of clusters of <u>neurons</u> sufficiently sophisticated to qualify as a *heartbrain*? Certainly, that must contain some sort of sensory processing abilities.

Perhaps the most overlooked, yet strongest sense we have is what we call our *<u>gut sense</u>*.  Considering that our gastrointestinal tract contains 95% of our body’s <u>serotonin</u>, has its own nervous system, and is filled with trillions of <u>microbes</u> sending terabytes of <u>information</u> to the <u>brain</u> every millisecond, <u>microbes</u> that are 100 times in <u>number</u> than the <u>cells</u> in the rest of the body and 10 times the <u>number</u> of <u>cells</u> in the <u>brain</u>, all of which having a significant impact on the <u>brain</u>,[^128],[^129] one would have to consider the *gut* as a powerful organ with its own senses.[^130] Knowing this, perhaps we should start considering what <u>microbes</u> we are exposed to at birth that so dramatically affects our <u>brain</u> growth.  Those born under natural conditions are exposed to the <u>microbes</u> of their natural surroundings.  How do C-section births and exposure to the <u>microbes</u> of hospitals, urban dwellings, and processed food, alter our <u>brain</u> and gut development?

What about the sense that allows blind people to detect the emotions of a person in a photo?[^131] What sense was activated by the practice of *merpati putih* (“white dove”) in Mary <u>Yogamaatha</u>, the nine-year-old Indian girl who demonstrated at the 2015 Business Advocacy summit at Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. that she could read blindfolded using only her third eye?[^132] How do we use the 6 additional senses identified by researchers at Harvard Medical School?[^133]

Our model of 5 senses is quaint, at best, and that is being generous, especially considering it was proposed over 2,000 years ago by the same philosopher, <u>Aristotle</u>, who held back <u>physics</u> for centuries with some of his completely inaccurate <u>ideas</u> about such things as <u>gravity</u> that were proven wrong 1,600 years later by <u>Galileo</u>, and <u>atoms</u>, which were theorized by <u>Leucippus</u> and <u>Democritus</u> 100 years before <u>Aristotle</u> declared the idea as nonsense.  Why do we persist in holding on to such antiquated <u>ideas</u> about something so fundamental to our <u>understanding</u> of ourselves, <u>society</u>, and <u>reality</u>?

Perhaps what we call some forms of <u>telepathy</u> or <u>ESP</u> are simply quite natural consequences of senses we have that we don’t know or believe we have or choose to ignore.  Just look at some of the amazing senses of some insects and animals as an example of the abilities of their genetic machinery:

- <u>Buzzards</u> can see small rodents from three miles away.
- <u>Bees</u> have a ring of iron oxide in the belly to feel <u>magnetic</u> <u>fields</u> and have eyes that see polarized light.
- A <u>cockroach</u> can detect <u>movement</u> 2,000 times the diameter of a hydrogen atom.
- <u>Elephants</u> have a hearing range of 1 to 20,000 hertz, and can also hear with their nose and feet.
- The <u>shark</u> has special eyes that can see electricity.
- When you look at the sidewalk, you see cement and dirt, but that same sidewalk tells a bloodhound of someone who has walked there eight hours ago, what the soles of their shoes were made of, and what brand of cigarettes they smoked.
- <u>Dolphins</u> see sound <u>waves</u> as 3D images.

#### **Key 77:** <u>Transcendental</u> or extrasensory forms of communication exist.

We can’t leave the subject of “<u>Telepathy</u>, <u>ESP</u>, or Something” without at least a nod to those institutions who have done more research on the subject that any other in the world (outside of the Soviet Union).  Who are these pioneers of expanded <u>consciousness</u>? The Central <u>Intelligence</u> Agency (CIA), Army <u>Intelligence</u> and Security Command (INSCOM), <u>Defense</u> <u>Intelligence</u> Agency (DIA), and Stanford research Institute (SRI).  Unfortunately, the millions of dollars that was spent on their research into <u>telepathy</u>, <u>ESP</u>, and remote viewing was classified (until recently), and had nothing to do with bettering the human condition.  Of course, they were seeing how such abilities could be used as weapons of war and espionage.  From 1972 to 1995 there were a <u>number</u> of federally funded projects dedicated to this task with code names like “Senate”, “Gondola Wish”, “Grill Flame”, “Center Lane”, “Dragoon Absorb”, “Project CF,”, “Sun Streak”, and ultimately “Stargate”. 

So, why did they stop their research in 1995 (assuming they actually *did* stop the research)?  Even though they achieved stunning levels of success, the error rate was too large to be used as a weapon, and (thankfully) their weapons of war and espionage needed to be 100% reliable and as close to 100% accurate as possible.

Fortunately, many of the documents from these projects have been declassified. By the looks of their test results, there is absolutely no question they achieved not only miraculous results but created a revolutionary model of <u>reality</u> that apparently worked! 

Here are some excerpts from the declassified file CIA-RDP96-00789R001300010001-6 titled “Coordinate Remote Viewing (Theory and Dynamics)”[^409] (Images recreated from original for clarity, but not complete.  See original.):

> Somewhere, perhaps in the unconscious mind, there exists what we label “The Matrix”. The Matrix knows no boundaries and has no <u>limitations</u> – it contains all <u>information</u> about all things. It could be thought of as omnipotent or you could think of it as a database etc.

<center><img src='../Images/ill2.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

> The Matrix has within it “<u>Patterns</u>” – think of these as points within a 3 dimensional box (see illustration #2). the “<u>patterns</u>” within the Matrix each poses and radiates their own energy. This <u>energy</u> is emitted in the form of a signal or “signal line” which is peculiar to that specific pattern.

<center><img src='../Images/ill3.png' style='width:80%'/></center> 

> This “<u>pattern</u>” has other names by which it is known – it can be referred to as a “Thought Ball” or as a "Gestalt”. A Gestalt can be described as “The <u>Pattern</u>” and all of its associated <u>patterns</u> (see Illustration #3).

*Note: “Gestalt”, by definition, refers to the form or shape of something and suggests that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  In this context it refers to <u>patterns</u> made up of patterns. . Its origins go back to 1912, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, where psychologists Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka proposed the <u>concept</u> in their “Experimental Studies of the Perception of <u>Movement</u>” (“Experimentelle Studien über das Sehen von Bewegung”).*

> "Cognitrons” are a <u>pattern</u> product, created by the interaction between <u>neurons</u> and synapses – after either a physical or emotional event. Cognitrons exist in the unconscious mind and can exist as separate <u>patterns</u> or as clusters of related <u>patterns</u> (see Illustration #3)

*Note: “Cognitrons” might sound more like one of giant <u>alien</u> Autobots commanded by Optimus Prime in the unending battle against the <u>evil</u> Decepticons, but the term comes out of the <u>field</u> of Biological Cybernetics and refers to “A <u>self-organizing</u> multilayered neural network”[^411].  The cognitron has also given birth to the neocognitron, a <u>hierarchical</u> layering of <u>cells</u> specifically dedicated to <u>pattern</u> recognition[^412].*

As an aside, personally, I strongly suspect that the The Wachowskis Brothers (The Wachowskis Sisters after 2013), being the Edge Lords that they are, were familiar with this document when they were choosing the name for their 1999 movie “The Matrix” that questioned the <u>nature</u> of <u>reality</u>, and perhaps it was even a source of inspiration.    Compare the descriptions above:

> The Matrix knows no boundaries and has no <u>limitations</u> – it contains all <u>information</u> about all things. It could be thought of as omnipotent or you could think of it as a database etc.

 &hellip; with the (much more dramatic and plot-driven) description *Morpheus* gives to *Neo*:

> The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to <u>work</u> … when you go to church … when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

More to the point, this model led to results, and shares a <u>number</u> of <u>concepts</u> with the thologram.  

<center><img src='../Images/ill5.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

The difference being, the thologram is a self-organizing/self-replicating homogeneous/holistic process where the instances exists *within* the <u>tholon</u>, rather than the heterogeneous processes that connect instances, which may or may not be self-similar/self-replicating,  that appear external to the receiver. 

There is so much evidence[^410] collected by the CIA, INSCOM, DIA, and  SRI and under the most stringent conditions, and so much anecdotal evidence from legitimate sources that it is difficult to imagine any legitimate scientist not taking it seriously, but, many do not.

## Clues

<u>Telepathy</u> or otherwise, it’s a safe bet to say that some form of <u>transcendental</u> or extrasensory form of communication exists, and this might be a way to access <u>tholonic</u> data.  It’s the specifics of it that seem to be elusive.  Proving such a thing is similar to asking me to prove that Australia exists.  I know many people from Australia, I can find Australia on a map, I know of Australian <u>politics</u> and history, but all of that is anecdotal as I have never been to Australia and if you asked me to prove Australia’s <u>existence</u> by the strictest scientific standards, I could not without actually going to Australia.  All I could say is I have a lot of evidence from trustworthy sources.  

This is the literal definition of an *axiom*, which is “A principle that is accepted as true without proof”.  Examples of scientific axioms are “Every effect has a cause, and every cause has an effect”, “<u>Reality</u> can be understood through <u>reason</u>”, “The <u>Universe</u> is knowable”, “The <u>Universe</u> is governed my immutable <u>laws</u>”, “A shared physical <u>reality</u> exists for all local observers”, to name just a few of the many.  None of these are provable, but they are assumed to be true.  Ironically, the word “axiom” is synonymous with “faith”, but sounds much more “sciency”.  The underlying foundation of both axioms and faith is trust.  In a way, <u>science</u> is the ultimate conspiracy theory, as it only makes sense if everyone accepts the unprovable axiomatic truths that <u>science</u> depends on.  Faith, on the other hand, requires no acceptance other than one's own.  One migth even consider the scientific definition of “real” to be axiomatic, as, while there maybe proof, that doesn't make it true, it only makes it acceptable, as we pointed out in the “cow in the <u>field</u>” problem.

## Analogs

What mechanism actually does the <u>transmitting</u> and receiving among animals, <u>humans</u>, perhaps even plants and rocks? After all, they too have a form of <u>awareness</u> and intelligence.  Their <u>collective</u> mind? Their <u>energy</u> <u>fields</u>? Their physical <u>structure</u>? 

<u>Dawkins</u> suggests that <u>memes</u> are the non-genetic manner in which <u>information</u> is passed on.  He also strongly disagrees with Sheldrake’s <u>morphic-field</u> hypothesis.  Unfortunately for <u>Dawkins</u>, <u>memes</u> cannot explain test results that morphic-fields can.  To add insult to injury, <u>morphic-field</u> theory not only has room for <u>memes</u> but can explain one way that <u>memes</u> can spread, so, Sheldrake: 1, Dawkins: 0.

We don’t need to know the specifics of *what* is being <u>transmitted</u>  just yet.  Let’s consider the *how* by looking at how we <u>humans</u> have learned to send and receive information.

When you want to send something to somewhere, how is that done? Maybe you use a postal service or your computer network.  In either case, you are collecting the <u>information</u> and delivering it *not* to the final destination, but to a service or infrastructure that does the delivering.  This is the case with radio, television, <u>electricity</u>, and even <u>nature</u> if we consider how <u>seeds</u>, an instantiated form of <u>information</u>, can be transported around the world via air, water, hiking boots, animals and in the case of mushroom spores and <u>viruses</u>, intergalactically via meteors and space-wind.  These “<u>seeds</u>” are not only carriers of <u>DNA</u>, but possibly <u>information</u> or messages from off-world <u>intelligence</u>, according to some researchers[^134], including Dr.  Francis H. C. <u>Crick</u>, the co-discoverer of <u>DNA</u>, who, in his paper *Directed Panspermia*[^135], hypothesized that the <u>DNA</u> itself arrived from space.

[^134]: Crick, F., & Orgel, L. (1973). **Directed panspermia.** Icarus, 19(3), 341-346. doi:10.1016/0019-1035(73)90110-3
[^135]: Sullivan, W. (1979, May 07). **Scientists Examine Tiny Viruses for Messages from Outer Space**. Retrieved from <https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/07/archives/scientists-examine-tiny-viruses-for-messages-from-outer-space.html>

For example…

It is easy to imagine applying the well-developed model of telecommunications that we currently use, called the *Open Systems Interconnection* model, to a model of information-sharing among various forms of intelligence.

<center><img src='../Images/096-ISOstack.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

To be clear, we are not saying that this is how it works, nor are we saying this is *not* how it works.  We are suggesting that we might find new perspectives if we apply the models we have developed, which are based on natural <u>laws</u>, to things we do not yet understand.  In this case, for example, we see that the physical body and <u>intelligence</u> are at the opposite ends of the pyramid, implying that the brain/nervous system is more of a receiver/transmitter rather than a generator, as creating new <u>information</u> requires <u>intention</u>, cognition, and intelligence.  This is a radically different <u>concept</u> than the current mainstream and antiquated idea that the mind, <u>consciousness</u>, and <u>intelligence</u> *must* arise out of <u>brain</u> activity.  Other successful models that we currently use today could also be applied to things we do not yet understand, at least as a starting point of investigation.

Still, none of this addresses the specifics of where the <u>information</u> is stored or <u>transmitted</u> from.

## <u>Collective</u> <u>Memory</u> 

The idea that a <u>field</u> <u>intelligence</u> is in some way an extension of the idea of the *<u>collective</u> mind* or *<u>collective</u> <u>consciousness</u>* was formalized to a great degree by Carl <u>Jung</u>’s idea of a <u>collective</u> subconscious and <u>collective</u> <u>memory</u>, although, it may be more accurate to describe the idea of a <u>collective</u> unconscious as a primitive <u>understanding</u> of *<u>field</u> <u>intelligence</u>*.  This is still a very fertile area of research across many disciplines.[^136]

[^136]: **Collective Memory.**(n.d.). <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/collective-memory>

Sadly, no theories exist to explain where and how long-term <u>collective</u> <u>memories</u> are stored.  In the West, the idea of a <u>collective</u> <u>memory</u> has been around since the early 20<sup>th</sup> century French sociologist Maurice <u>Halbwachs</u> coined the term.  His hypothesis on how <u>collective</u> <u>memory</u> was stored and <u>transmitted</u> is extremely unspecific but generally depends on human-to-human transmissions, similar to Dawkin’s theory on how <u>memes</u> are spread.  Given that <u>Halbwachs</u> was a student of Emile <u>Durkheim</u> and a devoted Marxist, one has to question his entire premise of a “<u>collective</u>,” especially in light of his claim that human <u>memory</u> can *only* function in a <u>collective</u>, and then goes on to give examples of his hypothesis of <u>collective</u> <u>memory</u> by comparing the “<u>collective</u> <u>memory</u>” of the bourgeoisie, <u>religious</u> and the working class, which may be valid, but is extremely myopic.  Still, he did coin the term, even if his premise was infected by a <u>virulent</u> and parasitic ideology (not unlike the Emerald <u>Wasp</u>).

Current thinking still revolves around <u>cultural</u> expression as being the primary way that <u>collective</u> <u>memories</u> are transmitted; dance, stories, monuments, etc.  These are certainly reinforcing factors, but this idea alone cannot explain Man’s <u>collective</u> <u>memory</u> of “the whole history of the human race”, as <u>Jung</u> claims is the source of our <u>fear</u> of <u>fire</u>, falling, and social status, to name just a few.  Some of these <u>memories</u> are epigenetic/genetic, such as being born with the <u>fear</u> of loud noises, which comes from the <u>memory</u> that loud noises are generally a harbinger of something that’s bound to make <u>life</u> more difficult, but can all our <u>collective</u> <u>memories</u> be stored in our <u>DNA</u>? Perhaps that is what the 75% of our junk <u>DNA</u> holds (recently upgraded from the previous 98% junk), or perhaps we don’t yet understand its function.  Maybe the junk <u>DNA</u> is more of an antenna than a transcoder? Apparently, we have no idea, but whatever it is, could it account for storing “the whole history of the human race”?  This seems very unreasonable.

One place worth exploring is where and how these <u>patterns</u> exist is the <u>epigenetic</u> transmission of experiences and <u>memories</u> passed on to descendants.  Why <u>epigenetics</u>?  Because <u>epigenetics</u> appears to be one of the more effective ways that contextual <u>information</u> is learned, stored and passed on.  In one of the classic test cases, the descendants of mice that were trained to not like the smell of cherry blossoms also had an aversion to the scent of cherry blossoms[^159].  Rather than an alteration of the genetic code itself, <u>epigenetics</u> describes how a gene expresses itself and explains how <u>DNA</u> can be modified by non-genetic stimuli, like <u>fear</u>, <u>love</u>, environmental preferences, even dreams, suggesting that what we inherit may go far beyond the human traditional genetic traits.

It will be interesting and informative to see how the <u>Information</u> Age will alter our <u>collective</u> <u>consciousness</u>, <u>memory</u>, and  <u>tholonic</u> <u>archetype</u>[^137], as its effect will be as profound as the discovery of fire.

## Engrams

Another candidate is how the <u>brain</u> creates and stores memories.  We have developed the <u>concept</u> of an *engram*, which is the means by which biochemical and biophysical processes store our response to external stimuli.  The engram, first described by German Zoologist Richard Serman in the early 1900s, was based on what he called the *mnemetic principle*, which states that the imprint made in the nervous system (including the <u>brain</u>) can, when stimulated by external stimulus, reconstruct the experience.  This is a very <u>holographic</u> idea, in that <u>holograms</u> reconstruct imagery by illuminating a previous record of that imagery.  The images below demonstrate how the “<u>memory</u>” of the image of a 3-dimensional cat can be stored on a 2D surface of <u>holographic</u> film, but looking at the film we would have no way of knowing that there is any <u>information</u> there, let alone the <u>information</u> that describes a 3D cat.

An important technical detail regarding <u>holograms</u> as it applies to <u>memory</u> is that many images can be recorded on top of each other, each with a different angle of illumination.  All those images can be reconstructed simply by changing the angle of the <u>hologram</u> when viewing.  This is why, and how, a <u>holographic</u> <u>memory</u> cube the size of a small closet (5m<sup>2</sup>) can store every word ever spoken or written by all humans.[^138]

[^138]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte>

<center><img src='../Images/097-holograms.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

This imprint, or “mnemetic trace”, so named after the Greek muse of <u>memory</u> “Mneme,” is also a precursor to <u>Dawkins</u> “<u>meme</u>,” as the <u>meme</u> is a <u>cultural</u> version of an engram.

The 50 years of research following Serman’s hypothesis of the engram boils down to, for our purposes:

> (1) <u>memories</u> are not localized but are instead distributed within functional areas of the cortex and
> (2) <u>memory</u> traces are not isolated cortical connections between inputs and outputs.[^139]
> 
[^139]: Darryl Bruce (2001) **Fifty Years Since Lashley’s In Search of the Engram**: Refutations and Conjectures, Journal of the History of the Neurosciences, 10:3, 308-318, DOI: 10.1076/jhin.10.3.308.9086<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1076/jhin.10.3.308.9086>

Might we see these same characteristics in our own <u>collective</u> <u>memory</u> technology otherwise known as the Internet? Perhaps.  Decentralized and distributed <u>information</u> networks, such as Bitcoin’s Blockchain, TOR (The Onion Router), and IPFS (Interplanetary File System) are probably early stages of such a thing.  The irony of the Internet is that when it was originally developed by <u>DARPA</u>, it was designed to be much more decentralized then it is today to the point where it could withstand a nuclear attack and continue operating, but today much of the decentralization has been removed as it is not in the best interests of <u>government</u> and business who prefer a more “consolidated” model (many have actual Internet kill switches[^140], including England and allegedly the U.S. as well, but the U.S. Supreme Court said the <u>government</u> is not required to confirm or deny the claim).  This is not surprising given that <u>memory</u> is what connects the past to the present and determines the directions of the future, so who=ever controls <u>memory</u>, personal or <u>collective</u>,  controls the past, the present, and the future.

[^140]: “**Internet Kill Switch**.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 24 Jan. 2019,<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_kill_switch>

If we extrapolate these <u>ideas</u> when looking for how <u>field</u> <u>memory</u> works, we might want to start with the presumptions that *<u>field</u> <u>memory</u>* is decentralized and distributed within the medium of the field.  What and where is this medium? Anywhere there is <u>energy</u>, as the <u>field</u> *is* <u>energy</u>, although when referring to the context of instances as opposed to the pure <u>archetypes</u>, then the instances themselves would be a part of the medium as well.  <u>Field</u> <u>memory</u> is not stored as discrete <u>quanta</u> of <u>information</u> but rather as an organized <u>pattern</u> of otherwise dis-integrated “particles” of <u>information</u>, which we refer to as data.  Were we to see this <u>data</u> alone it would appear as chaos.  When seen from a different perspective, or decoded, or “re-stimulated,” as in the case of engrams or <u>holograms</u>, or in a different context, it may appear as information.

## Modulation

Another model to look at might be the way we have learned to <u>transmit</u> <u>information</u> by modulating the amplitude or <u>frequency</u> of a <u>wave</u>, similar to how TVs, radios, and acoustic modems work.  If we accept the idea that all <u>energy</u> moves in <u>cycles</u> and <u>waves</u>, including the <u>energy</u> of <u>ideas</u>, then perhaps those <u>waves</u> are also modulated in some way with information.  As has been suggested earlier, there are <u>waves</u> we either don’t recognize or don’t consider as waves.  For example, is it possible that the “<u>waves</u>” from the “<u>cycles</u>” of the moon or the <u>Arctic Tern</u> could be “modulated” to carry <u>information</u>? It sounds crazy, but we know that <u>brain</u> <u>waves</u> encode <u>information</u> (possibly *rules of behavior*[^141]) as time codes[^142], that light can store quantum <u>memories</u>[^143], and that the same <u>waves</u> we use for communication are the same <u>waves</u> that have filled the entire <u>Universe</u> since the <u>Big Bang</u>[^144].  Since the discovery of gravitational <u>waves</u>, we have been looking into how we can <u>transmit</u> <u>information</u> in that medium as well[^145].  Is it possible that these <u>waves</u> are modulated with <u>information</u>, making the <u>waves</u> both the carrier of <u>information</u> as well as the storage medium? Considering how little we know about the <u>Universe</u>, <u>Reality</u>, and Everything, these “crazy” <u>ideas</u> may not be *that* crazy.

Like my grandmother used to say “when you can’t find something, you need to look everywhere.”

## <u>Dark-Matter</u>

One candidate is dark-energy/dark-matter.

Before I describe this idea, I want to make it very clear that <u>I am</u> not a <u>cosmologist</u>, physicist, or scientist of any kind, so this idea may be ridiculously naive and laughable to anyone who is knowledgeable on the subject.  That said, let’s give it a whirl.

<u>dark-energy</u> occupies 70% of the known <u>Universe</u>, can’t be directly observed, and emits no light or energy.  <u>Dark-matter</u> occupies another 25%, and the measly remaining 5% is the matter we can see.  <u>Dark-matter</u> can have dark-electrons and dark-protons and there is even dark-chemistry (and maybe dark-tholons, like the virtual ones?).  <u>dark-energy</u> also produces dark-electromagnetism and dark-electricity.  <u>Dark-matter</u> does not interact with “regular” matter.  In fact, there are (believed to be) dark-galaxies, which is the galaxy of dark-energy/matter superimposed on a galaxy of “regular” energy/matter.  In short, everything that exists has a “dark” clone that we can’t detect.  What better medium than <u>dark-energy</u> is there that could collect <u>information</u> from every scale of <u>reality</u>?

Dark-matter/energy is not just some weird thing we kind of guess is there.  Evidence suggests it actually forms the <u>structure</u> of the entire <u>Universe</u>, but all we really know about <u>dark-matter</u> is it exists, it exists everywhere, and it interacts with <u>gravity</u>, one of the 4 fundamental forces of energy.  This then makes <u>gravity</u> the nominee for how the <u>information</u> is <u>transmitted</u> between <u>dark-energy</u> and the “regular” <u>energy</u> of our reality.  Perhaps there is some entanglement involved with <u>dark-energy</u>, allowing <u>information</u> to travel faster than the <u>speed of light</u>?  

<u>dark-energy</u> is quite elusive, as we can’t detect it or measure it, but we can see its effects in the expanding <u>Universe</u>, as <u>dark-energy</u> seems to be continually being created (like some sort of dynamic <u>memory</u> system that keeps expanding to accommodate the exponentially increasing storage requirements of an expanding <u>Universe</u>?).  Perhaps there is a relationship between extrasensory phenomena and dark-matter/energy in some way?

Has anyone tested this? I have scoured the Internet looking for such research and could find nothing.  However, I did run across this very interesting post from one of the senior members of Cambridge University’s Institute of Continuing Education who posted the following:

> Subject: Can quantum <u>dark-energy</u> explain <u>telepathy</u>?
>
> <u>Telepathy</u> and quantum entanglement seem to match each other in that a communication connection exists, but no tangible connection.  Could there be a hitherto unknown <u>dark-energy</u> particle produced by electrical impulses in the <u>brain</u>? Could it be that entangled particles of this <u>dark-energy</u> are shared? If a plasmon circuit in the <u>brain</u> creates <u>patterns</u> of these dark matter particles, based on thoughts and <u>ideas</u>, do people with the shared particles share the same <u>patterns</u> of thoughts and <u>ideas</u>? How long-lived are these particles, how long do they maintain <u>patterns</u>, and what might be the mechanism for transfer? These particles may be exchanged through quantum molecular tunneling, allowing a <u>brain</u> to <u>transmit</u> them outside of the head, and a person with a corollary quantum molecular tunnel for reception to readily receive the particles.  Persons sharing close and personal spaces may be more likely to transfer these particles to each other such as twins, relatives, friends, and even enemies.  It may be that these particles are long-lasting and this may allow objects to be imbued with the dark particle <u>patterns</u>, allowing a sensitive to read a person through the object.  It may be that wherever a <u>transmitter</u> goes the location they were at is imbued with thought <u>patterns</u> of their experiences.  The implications of such a mechanism for <u>telepathy</u> imply this process may be amplified by <u>electronics</u> to increase the strength of transmission and reception.  It also implies that we could control <u>electronics</u> through the use of telepathy.[^146]

[^146]: “**Can Quantum Dark Energy Explain Telepathy?”** Can Quantum Dark Energy Explain Telepathy? \| Naked Science Forum, <https://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=52709.0>

There were no replies.

In June 2019, University of Portsmouth, U.K, physicist Melvin Vopson published a paper titled "*The <u>information</u> content of the <u>Universe</u> and the implications for the missing <u>Dark-Matter</u>*"[^323], wherein he details the "*The mass-energy-information equivalence principle*".  The gist of this theory and principle is that not only is <u>information</u> the 5<sup>th</sup> form of matter, but what scientists have been erroneously referring to <u>dark-matter</u> *is* this 5<sup>th</sup> form of <u>energy</u>!

[^323]: Vopson, Melvin.  (2019).  **”The information content of the Universe and the implications for the missing Dark Matter."**10.13140/RG.2.2.19933.46560. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333751969_The_information_content_of_the_Universe_and_the_implications_for_the_missing_Dark_Matter

This theory is not mere speculation.  Vopson has performed tests that anyone (with the proper equipment) can replicate.  And what do the tests show?  <u>Information</u> has a tiny,  tiny, amount of mass; 2.91&times;10<sup>-40</sup>Kg/bit, exactly.  Applying that value to the size of DM in the <u>Universe</u> results in 2.59&times;10<sup>82</sup> bits of information.  This is quite close to the 10<sup>82</sup> <u>atoms</u> in the <u>Universe</u> as mentioned earlier.

If DM is actually <u>information</u>, the 5<sup>th</sup> form of matter, then certainly this is the most likely candidate for where all this <u>field</u> <u>information</u> is located.

How does this theory fit into the <u>tholonic</u> model? Surprisingly well!

<center><img src="../Images/infos.png" style="width:80%"/></center>

The similarity between the 3 properties of both are astounding.  You can see the formulas follow Newton’s <u>laws</u>, and, in <u>tholonic</u> fashion, the qualities of &div; define the 2 corners of the CD spectrum, and that of &times; define the CD spectrum itself.  It also aligns such that *<u>mass</u>* is the child of the N-source, implies that <u>mass</u> is the instance of <u>energy</u>, which we know is true.  Why aren’t the values of *<u>energy</u>*, *<u>mass</u>* and *infobit* mapped to the N, D, C corners, but rather to the sides of the <u>tholon</u>? Because this is the ‘holarchic’ format, rather the the <u>tholonic</u> format, as explained in chapter 7, “<u>Structure</u>”:   

> The primary <u>reason</u> why the properties of <u>movement</u> and <u>energy</u> are the key points in a thologram rather than the instantiated elements, as in the <u>holarchy</u>, is because it is the properties of <u>movement</u> and <u>energy</u> that are consistent at every level of creation. 

*<u>Mass</u>* and  *infobits*, in this case, are more like instances than they are like the flow of <u>energy</u>, at least in relation to the formulas that defined their existence.  Even *<u>energy</u>* can be an instance in this context if we consider it to be an instance of the prime N-source of A&I. In practice, it doesn’t make a big difference which way they are aligned as the same <u>patterns</u> emerge.

The reader has probably noticed that the ***kTln(2)*** equation can be replaced with the ***E*** from ***E=mc<sup>2</sup>***.  What is that equation? It represents the amount of <u>kinetic</u> <u>energy</u> at a certain temperature (the ***kT*** part, the Boltzmann Constant applied to temperature because higher/lower temps means higher/lower <u>kinetic</u> <u>energy</u>) and the ***ln(2)*** represents the exponential growth or decay over time (remember from chapter 8, “Instances”, that ***ln(x)*** allows you to **plug in growth/decay and get the time** it would take to reach amount *x*).  In short ***kTln(2)*** is another way to say ***E*** for a specific context (of time and temperature).

Related, in some way, is the fact that <u>information</u> is carried in the <u>magnetic</u> part of the electromagnetic <u>field</u>, and that the <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u> only exists if there is <u>movement</u> of energy.  If infobits have <u>energy</u> and <u>mass</u>, according to Vobson, and <u>information</u> is data+energy, according to the <u>tholonic</u> model, then <u>information</u> *must* create some kind of field.  Can infobits be induced with such a <u>field</u>, like how a <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u> can create <u>movement</u> of electric charges via <u>induction</u>?  

This idea that <u>information</u> has <u>mass</u> is also in line with the <u>concept</u> that <u>energy</u> alone is undetectable, unusable, and meaningless if it does not interact with some *thing*, even if that thing is itself (such as <u>mass</u> as <u>energy</u>).  <u>Information</u>, being data+energy, is a form of energy.  If <u>information</u> has no interaction with some *thing* than it is undetectable.  Is the tiny <u>mass</u> that <u>information</u> has the *thing* that allows to exist in to be perceived?  The ultimate question is, if <u>information</u> has <u>mass</u>, and <u>information</u> is growing exponentially, then at some point, due to the conservation of <u>energy</u>, the <u>Universe</u> will be nothing but information.  Vobson believes this concern has some weight (literally) as he predicts an <u>information</u> catastrophe in about 350 years when the <u>number</u> of bits of <u>information</u> exceed the <u>atoms</u> of <u>Earth</u>, which is around 10<sup>50</sup>, and the power to sustain those bits will be 15.5&times;10<sup>15</sup> <u>watts</u>, more than the total <u>planetary</u> power available today.  In 500 years, <u>information</u> will account for half of the world’s weight.[^328]

## <u>Gravity</u>

Roger <u>Penrose</u> also suggests that quantum <u>gravity</u> and how it relates to *quantum state reduction*, or the collapsing of a <u>waveform</u>, i.e. the instantiation of a <u>tholon</u>, is the source of <u>consciousness</u>[^147].  If the <u>tholonic</u> idea that <u>awareness</u> is the source of <u>existence</u>, then this suggests that <u>consciousness</u> is not only the byproduct of <u>awareness</u>, which makes perfect sense, but it is also a integral part of the instantiation of <u>tholonic</u> <u>patterns</u> as <u>consciousness</u> serves as the expression of <u>awareness</u> necessary to complete the instantiation process.

[^147]: Atmanspacher, Harald. “**Quantum Approaches to Consciousness.**” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Stanford University, November 5, 2019. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#PenrHameQuanGravMicr. Section 3.5

<u>Geometrically</u> speaking, while the infinitely expanding self-similar trigram is a result of the primary 3 states created by A&I, as previously shown, for it to instantiate into a 3D <u>tholon</u> it requires the 4<sup>th</sup> composite *white dot* to collapse into the tetrahedral thologram. <u>Consciousness</u> is an instance of <u>awareness</u>, and as such is composed of all 3 primary dots, e.g., subjective <u>awareness</u>, objective <u>awareness</u>, and the <u>awareness</u> of where they meet, or if you prefer, the <u>awareness</u> of *all*, *all that is possi5/3ble*, and *all that is*.  In the subatomic context, it instantiates as quantum <u>gravity</u>, which is the <u>force</u> that collapses the <u>wave</u> functions.  This suggests that <u>consciousness</u> and <u>gravity</u> are two instances of the same <u>pattern</u> or <u>tholon</u> within two different contexts.  

This would also suggest that in the world of <u>subatomic particles</u> where we have the basic trinity of <u>electrons</u>, <u>protons</u>, and <u>neutrons</u>, we would also expect to find a 4<sup>th</sup> particle that represents <u>gravity</u>, a *graviton*, and in fact, <u>science</u> has speculated that such a particle exists, they just haven’t found it yet.  

All of this is simply to suggest that if <u>gravity</u> is fundamental to <u>consciousness</u> and <u>existence</u>, then so too are their fields.  But <u>gravity</u> itself is a field.  And what is the source of that <u>field</u>?  Mass.  And what is the source of <u>mass</u>? A&I.  If we accept the alternative theory of the <u>Big Bang</u> that <u>mass</u> was created by the infinite <u>gravity</u> of the 0-dimensional <u>singularity</u>, then <u>gravity</u> my be the first instance of A&I.

Considering <u>gravity</u> (and <u>awareness</u>) is both mass-less and infinite yet binds the entire <u>Universe</u> together, it seems like an excellent candidate for exploring <u>field</u> memory.

Is there any evidence to suggest that <u>gravity</u> and <u>consciousness</u> are two instances of the same expressions in different scopes? Yes, there is.

Let’s  look at another one of Newton’s formulas that describes the gravitational force: <IMG src="../Images/math/160.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:12pt;"/> , where *F* is the gravitational <u>force</u> in <u>newtons</u>, *g* is the gravitational <u>field</u> as it applies to two different masses, and *S* is the separation between those two masses.  And yes, it also looks just like the Ohm’s <u>Law</u> for *<u>resistance</u>* <IMG src="../Images/math/161.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:12pt;"/>, which also suggests that <u>consciousness</u>, <u>gravity</u>, and <u>resistance</u> are the same <u>archetype</u> instantiated across three different scopes. 

If we do the <u>math</u>, we see all of Newton’s formulas <u>work</u> out correctly for <u>gravity</u>, but, with one mystery value for  G, the gravitational constant.

- **g &rarr;P**:  The **gravitational <u>field</u> of <u>mass</u>** equates to **power**, transference of <u>energy</u> over time.
- **F&rarr;R**: The **<u>force</u> of <u>gravity</u>** equates to **<u>resistance</u>**.  This value is the speed at which things fall, so 9.87 m/s<sup>2</sup> here on Earth.
- <img src="../Images/gmm.png" style="float:right;width:20%"/>**S&rarr;I**: The the distance between *observer* and *observed* equates to **current**, or the strength of energy.  As the distance lessens, the force increases, as **S** and **F** are inversely proportional.  *Note:  The terms observer and observed are the actual technical terms used, and not terms used here to add validity to the tholonic theory that reality itself emerged from the primal observer, the 0-dimensional concept of A&I, and the observed, the first creation of the A&I.*
- **G&rarr;V**: The **gravitational constant**, which is measured in <u>newtons</u>, equates to **<u>volts</u>**, or the pressure of <u>energy</u> that is inherent in all <u>mass</u> in the form of gravity.  **G** is measured as 6.67×10<sup>−11</sup> m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-2</sup> (newtons per cubic meter per kilogram per second-per second) . 

There is another correlation as well.  The limits of an electrical circuit are defined by the amount of charge, or current (amps), that is allowed to pass through a system at any given moment.  This is controlled by a fuse.  In the *E=mc<sup>2</sup>* equivalency we saw previously, it is *c*, the <u>speed of light</u>, that defines the limits of the system we call the <u>Universe</u>, but unlike amps, *c* can never change.  Here, in the <u>gravity</u> example, the defining <u>limitation</u> of the system is *S*, the distance between two fields.  So . let’s replace ***I*** (or *c)* with ***S*** and see if there is a reasonable correlation between <u>gravity</u> and <u>consciousness</u> when applied to Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> <u>law</u> and <u>tholons</u>?

For example: 

<img src="../Images/gr-consc.png" style="float:right;width:50%"/>**Separation (S)**: The separation in the context of consciousness is the first separation, that of subjective (observer) and objective (observed), so we will correlate the separation of the 2 masses with these two perspectives.

**<u>Awareness</u> (A)**:  The initial blue dot, the N-source, of the <u>tholonic</u> trigram is the first instance of <u>awareness</u>, and also correlates to *<u>force</u>*, *<u>potential</u>*, or *<u>volts</u>*, so we will correlate the gravitational constant to the N-source and the first state of awareness.

**<u>Consciousness</u> (C)**: As we mentioned before, what we are calling <u>consciousness</u> is an instance of <u>awareness</u>, more specifically, an instance of the <u>awareness</u> of a <u>tholonic</u> archetype.  This firmly places <u>consciousness</u> in the position of the child N-source, which correlates with electrical *power* (P) and the gravitational <u>field</u> (*g*).  This <u>concept</u> emerged in the spectrum of separation and matter, which are the instances of the primal <u>concepts</u> of *<u>nothingness</u>* and *<u>somethingness</u>*.

**<u>Mass</u> (M)**: We are left to correlate electrical <u>resistance</u> with the <u>force</u> of the gravitational <u>field</u> for a specific mass.  This fits, especially when we realize that it is the limiting and defining qualities of this <u>force</u> which holds everything in the <u>Universe</u> together and in their place.  <u>Mass</u> is the source of <u>gravity</u>, or, if we accept the theory that it was the infinite <u>gravity</u> of the <u>singularity</u> that created <u>mass</u>, then <u>mass</u> is an instance of gravity.  

All-in-all, this shows that <u>consciousness</u> is an instance of <u>awareness</u> in the context of <u>somethingness</u> (mass) and <u>nothingness</u> (separation).

For the question at hand, what this means is that if there is such as thing as a universal data-store of all the instances of <u>Awareness</u>, then we will find clues to its <u>existence</u> in the instances of <u>consciousness</u> and <u>mass</u>, in the differences between those instances, and how they relate to one another within the <u>unity</u> of Awareness.  

This attempt to quantify <u>consciousness</u> and <u>awareness</u> may sound very esoteric or even seem ridiculous to some, but more and more evidence suggests that <u>consciousness</u> is a <u>force</u> of <u>nature</u>, and as such, has quantifiable properties.

An example of directly applicable evidence comes from an article written by theoretical quantum physicist Swati <u>Nigam</u> entitled *<u>Gravity</u> As Conscious <u>Force</u> To Resolve Quantum <u>Gravity</u>*[^148], wherein she states:

[^148]: Swati Nigam , “**Gravity As Conscious Force To Resolve Quantum Gravity.**” Physics Foundations, July 31, 2017. DOI: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5234617.v1 Published in https://physicsfoundationsblog.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/gravity-as-conscious-force-to-resolve-quantum-gravity/; Downloadable PDF available at https://www.academia.edu/33993443/GRAVITY_AS_CONSCIOUS_FORCE_TO_RESOLVE_QUANTUM_GRAVITY

> According to current <u>science</u>, there is a missing connection between general relativity and <u>quantum mechanics</u> <u>concepts</u> of <u>physics</u>, which is needed to unify them into one, to <u>conceptualize</u> a unified <u>field</u> theory.

The article then goes on about the <u>nature</u> of the problem, ultimately concluding that <u>consciousness</u> itself is an additional <u>force</u> to the 4 forces of the Standard Model, a 5<sup>th</sup> <u>force</u>, and one that solves the challenges of the unified <u>field</u> theory in its attempt to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics.  Dr. <u>Nigam</u> goes on to say:

> Thus, we can use the term “conscious <u>force</u>” for gravitational force&hellip;.  ***Conscious <u>force</u>* is gravitational <u>force</u>** which is the unidentified fifth force.  This <u>force</u> is a synonym for gravitational <u>force</u>, works just like it on all matter entities, irrespective of their <u>nature</u> or position in space, both in macro or micro worlds.

If <u>Awareness</u> and its instances of <u>consciousness</u> is a fundamental <u>force</u>, then it has a <u>field</u>, and that <u>field</u> might hold clues to *<u>field</u> <u>memory</u>*, perhaps similar to the way the <u>memory</u> in the <u>brain</u> might be a *<u>neuronal</u> activity-associated <u>magnetic</u> <u>field</u>*? [^149]<sup>,</sup>[^150] In any case, there seems to be a strong correlation between <u>consciousness</u>, <u>gravity</u>, <u>dark-matter</u>, and information.

## Limits of <u>Consciousness</u>?

This idea that there might be a relationship between <u>consciousness</u> and <u>gravity</u> raises another question, and that is, if observation is required to collapse a <u>wave</u> function, then can we define <u>consciousness</u> as that which has the ability to observe?

First, let’s hear what Werner <u>Heisenberg</u> has to say about what *observation* means

> Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature.  The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and *it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being*; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the “possible” to the “actual”, is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory.  **\~Werner <u>Heisenberg</u>, *<u>Physics</u> and Philosophy*, p.  137**

And by “registering decisions” he means any sort of recording of effect that is the result of interacting with the cause, as long as that recording is a time-irreversible process.  It is this recording that separates *all that is possible* from *all that is*, or the *Definition* from the *<u>Contribution</u>*. This would imply that if one <u>atom</u> was altered as a result of  interacting with the <u>wave</u> function, it will collapse into a particle, so even a rock could be an “observer”.  It turns out that the act of observation is more analog than digital, meaning, the more something is observed, the more effect it has.  In a recent experiment[^151] it was shown that:

[^151]: Weizmann Institute Of Science. "**Quantum Theory Demonstrated: Observation Affects Reality.**" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 27 February 1998. <www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/02/980227055013.htm>

> …the greater the amount of “watching”, the greater the observer’s influence on what actually takes place.

So, a rock might be able to “observe”, but perhaps its observation would be too weak to have much of an effect on reality.  The experimenters built a machine with variable observation strength levels, but it would be very interesting to measure the observational strength levels of different forms of instances.  Are there stronger *observational powers* then what we <u>humans</u> have? This is unknown (I think), but what is known is that machines alone have enough observational power to collapse a <u>wave</u>[^155].

[^155]: Pritchard, David E., et al. “**Photon Scattering from Atoms in an Atom Interferometer: Coherence Lost and Regained.**” Coherence and Quantum Optics VII, 1996, pp. 133-141. doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-9742-8_18. <https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.3783> Full paper: <http://chapmanlabs.gatech.edu/papers/scattering_ifm_prl95.pdf>.

With this in mind, it might be useful to think of <u>awareness</u> as a <u>wave</u> function, a sea of “possibilities”, but <u>consciousness</u> as the “actual” instance of a collapsing <u>wave</u> of awareness.  This would support the idea that everything that exists potentially has a <u>consciousness</u>, but weak “observations” will produce weak <u>wave</u> function collapses, a weak instantiation of consciousness.  It would also suggest that the most “observation” that has ever taken place was at the moment of the <u>Big Bang</u>, when everything was “observed” by everything in the 1 trillion degree ball of super-plasma, and over time, observation decreases until no thing can “observe” anything else (that is, if the <u>Universe</u> continues to only expand).  In this way, the <u>Universe</u>’s ability to “observe” acts like entropy; the lower the <u>entropy</u> of the <u>Universe</u>, the more it could “observe”.  As <u>entropy</u> increases, the less it “observes”, until it becomes completely “blind”.  If nothing is observed, nothing collapses.  Like the tree that collapsed in the woods, if no one hears it, it is irrelevant whether it made any sound or not.  When nothing can be observed, everything is just a <u>wave</u> function of potential.  Perhaps  the Zen-like fate of the <u>Universe</u> is not the <u>Big Crunch</u> or <u>Big Freeze</u>, or Big anything&hellip; it just becomes irrelevant <u>wave</u> function of possibility.

## <u>Structured</u> <u>Memory</u>

Another possibility is <u>structure</u> itself.  It has been claimed that the <u>structure</u> of water can hold memory.  Although this claim has not been sufficiently tested by any means, there is at least some evidence to suggest it might be valid.  Dr.  <u>Emoto</u> has been the most public in his claims that water holds <u>memory</u>, and presents many examples and theories, but none of his <u>work</u> has been thoroughly tested by scientific standards. (*Note: At one point I felt it was necessary to subject his tests to scientific study, but I have come to understand that such testing will guarantee unsuccessful results regardless of the validity of his experiments due to the <u>nature</u> of <u>science</u> as we currently understand it*).

There is quite a lot of <u>information</u> available about <u>Emoto</u>’s <u>work</u> so I will not repeat any of it here.  However, Dr. Dean <u>Radin</u>, who has an impressive list of honors and a history of serious scientific <u>work</u>, did perform a “*Double-Blind Test of the Effects of Distant <u>Intention</u> on Water <u>Crystal</u> Formation*”[^307] and reported very significant results (P=0.001).  Dr. <u>Radin</u> has published a <u>number</u> of similar studies.

[^307]: Radin,D.,Hayssen,G.,Emoto,M.,&Kizu,T. (2006). **Double-Blind Test of the Effects of Distant Intention on Water Crystal Formation**. Explore,2(5), 408-411. doi:10.1016/j.explore.2006.06.004

<center><img src='../Images/098-waterdrops.png' style='width:90%'/></center>

Speaking only for myself, one of the more compelling pieces of evidence I have seen comes from the experiment where 4 students created 4 drops of water, all from the same source.  The image above shows the results of that experiment where each set of 4 drops was created by a different student.  

This experiment was performed by Dr. Brend <u>Kröplin</u> and his team, which makes the results all the more valid, as Dr. <u>Kröplin</u> not only received his Ph.D. in the hard sciences (his thesis was on the elastoplastic stability of steel bridges), but he was also dean of the *Institute for Statics and Dynamics of Aerospace <u>Structures</u>* of the University of Stuttgart as well as the winner of the Körber European <u>Science</u> Prize, which resulted in a 1.5 million deutschmark contract to produce high altitude (20km) communication equipment.  This puts him very high on the “trusted sources” list.

Even if this is not bulletproof evidence (similar to the <u>existence</u> of Australia for anyone who has never been there), it is enough to raise the question.  In addition, this test was also conducted using different types of flowers, and, according to the testers, the resulting <u>patterns</u> in the drops of water resembled the <u>patterns</u> of the flower.  <u>Tholonically</u>, this is exactly what we would expect to see, as it is <u>patterns</u> of <u>energy</u> that create the instance of the flower.

Another source that supports the idea of water holding <u>information</u> is Jacques <u>Benveniste</u>, a French immunologist who worked at the Institute of <u>Health</u> and Medical Research (INSERM) in 1988, who published a paper in *<u>Nature</u>* concluding that the configuration of <u>molecules</u> in water was biologically active even in the absence of the elements that caused that configuration.  This “water <u>memory</u>” was immediately picked up by the <u>homeopathic</u> community as proof of its efficacy, even though it did not really apply to homeopathy.

While <u>Emoto</u>’s <u>work</u> can easily be brushed off by skeptics and institutional authorities due to its lack of rigorous analysis, <u>Benveniste</u>’s <u>work</u> could not.

*<u>Nature</u>* magazine editor, John <u>Maddox</u> (yes, the same person who promoted the burning of Sheldrake’s book on the grounds of heresy, as well as claiming the <u>Big Bang</u> theory is “philosophically unacceptable” and that there was “no need to panic about AIDS”), prefaced the *<u>Nature</u>* article with an editorial comment entitled “When to believe the unbelievable”, which admitted: “There is no objective explanation of these observations”. That sounds like a begrudging admission, but it was more like a temporary retreat in preparation for the next offensive.

*<u>Nature</u>* did not want to publish the paper to begin with, holding its release for 2 years while awaiting independent confirmation from impartial laboratories in Israel, Italy, and Canada, who reported an observable biological effect.[^152]

[^152]: Thomas Y., Kahhak L., Aissa J. (2006) **The physical nature of the biological signal, a puzzling phenomenon: the critical contribution of Jacques Benveniste**. In: Pollack G.H., Cameron I.L., Wheatley D.N. (eds) Water and the Cell. Springer, Dordrecht, <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-4927-7_17>

After the paper was published, there was an explosion of meltdowns from the scientific community.  In response, *<u>Nature</u>* demanded that the experiment be repeated under conditions controlled by an ad-hoc selected team of its own, which included (and this should shed some light on their not-so-hidden intentions) the famous illusionist, pseudo-science enemy, and occasionally dishonest, James <u>Randi</u>, plus <u>Maddox</u> himself and a malpractice investigator.

The *<u>Nature</u>* team did, in fact, find the same results as <u>Benveniste</u>, but with one fascinating exception: the effects of the tests disappeared when the members of the laboratory did not know if the water sample had been treated or not.  One could claim the results were then biased based on this <u>knowledge</u>, but this would presume these hand-picked independent researchers were secretly fudging the data.  If they were not, then the implication is that simply the <u>awareness</u> of the state of the water samples was enough to affect the test results.  According to the <u>tholonic</u> model, being aware of something is sufficient to instantiate it to *some* degree, like a <u>tholonic</u> version of *observational powers*.  In any case, this was sufficient for *<u>Nature</u>* to publish a report on this methodological flaw in <u>Benveniste</u>’s experiments and officially called “water <u>memory</u>” pseudo-science[^153] and published an article calling the entire idea “delusional” (written by, of course, <u>Maddox</u>, <u>Randi</u>, and Stewart, another lover of dogma)[^154].  Case closed.

[^153]: “**When to Publish Pseudo-Science**.” Nature, vol. 334, no. 6181, 1988, pp. 367. doi:10.1038/334367a0. <https://www.nature.com/articles/334367a0>
[^154]: Maddox, John, et al. “**High-Dilution” Experiments a Delusion.**” Nature, vol. 334, no. 6180, 1988, pp. 287-290., doi:10.1038/334287a0. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2455869>

Or so they hoped, for not long after <u>Benveniste</u>’s paper, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and <u>Cultural</u> Organization (UNESCO) decided to take their own look into his work.  In their words:

> These <u>data</u> seem particularly important because they further enrich the immense achievements of molecular biology.  They also suggest the development of new modes of transmission of genetic messages (transmission, transduction, teleportation, etc.).

Fortunately, they did not invite <u>Maddox</u> or <u>Randi</u> to be a speaker.  Rather, they invited the Nobel Prize-winning discoverer of HIV, Luc <u>Montagnier</u>, who, much to the skeptic’s dismay, stunned many fellow scientists years earlier with claims that <u>DNA</u> emits weak electromagnetic <u>waves</u> that cause structural changes in water that persist even in extremely high dilutions&hellip; which is not exactly water-memory, but very close.  <u>Montagnier</u> has gone on to say that “*More scientists are becoming convinced [of water-memory] by the <u>data</u>*” as new evidence appears.

OK, that was a long-winded bit of history there, but it shows the <u>resistance</u> to new <u>ideas</u> as well as the real possibility that water-memory exists.

But <u>I am</u> not a scientist, so I don’t have to worry about what the editors at *<u>Nature</u>* or what dubious debunkers think, so I can hypothesize the following: If the <u>structure</u> of water can hold <u>memory</u>, does this mean that the <u>structure</u> of other things can also hold <u>memory</u>? Can the thologram itself hold <u>memory</u> in its mega-meta-structure? If we claim that the <u>structure</u> of our material world is but an instance of that <u>structure</u> in the thologram, then we would have to say “yes”, and that then opens the door to the <u>ideas</u> that all <u>structure</u>, in every corner of the <u>Universe</u>, might be a <u>memory</u> store.  Perhaps certain <u>structures</u> are better suited to hold certain types of <u>memory</u>? More exciting is the possibility that the mechanism to access this <u>memory</u>, and the <u>knowledge</u>, is to simply become aware of it.  This last part is trickier than it sounds, as we don’t know what we don’t know, so how do we know what to become aware of?

Regardless of the theory, whatever it happens to be, the morphic or <u>tholonic</u> <u>field</u> would have to be something like an electromagnetic <u>field</u> in a different context, as both are caused by the <u>movement</u> of energy.

#### **Key 78:** Everything that exists due to the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> has a <u>field</u> that has its origins in A&I.  This <u>field</u> is the foundation of <u>consciousness</u> and knowledge.



The redundant and self-similar expressions of <u>energy</u> can be seen in the ever more complex and integrated <u>patterns</u> that have evolved since all of creation began as an infinitesimally small <u>singularity</u> of infinite <u>gravity</u>, <u>zero</u> time, and total <u>mass</u> that was the <u>seed</u> of this Universe.

By the same token, the redundant and self-similar expressions of <u>awareness</u> can be seen in the ever more complex and integrated <u>patterns</u> that have evolved since all of creation began as a 0-dimensional dot whose only property was A&I.

The claim that <u>energy</u> itself is a fundamental form of A&I implies that everything that exists is also a form of A&I in the same way that everything that exists is a form of energy.  To be aware of something is to direct <u>energy</u> to some <u>concept</u> or idea, thereby moving <u>energy</u> through that <u>pattern</u> and the <u>Bell curve</u> of that <u>archetype</u>, which alters the *norm* of what and how that <u>archetype</u> will instantiate itself.

From the <u>tholonic</u> perspective, if the claim is “<u>energy</u> alone can’t be observed; only its interactions with other forms of <u>energy</u> (mass) can” is true, then it is also true that “<u>awareness</u> alone can’t be observed; only its interactions with other forms of <u>awareness</u> can”.

> “<u>Consciousness</u> [ed: or <u>awareness</u> from the <u>tholonic</u> perspective] is part of our <u>Universe</u>, so any physical theory which makes no proper place for it falls fundamentally short of providing a genuine description of the world.”[^156]  **\~Roger <u>Penrose</u>**

[^156]: Penrose, Roger, and Malcolm Angus Hugh. MacCallum. **Twistor Theory: An Approach to the Quantisation of Fields and Space-time**. Amsterdam: North-Holland Pub., 1973.

Tholonic-fields exist in the realm of thought, <u>ideas</u>, and <u>concepts</u>, so any experiments that might be run probably need to be thought-based in nature.  Is there any evidence that thoughts can directly alter our material <u>reality</u>? If the answer is yes, that might support the idea that altering <u>archetypes</u> in the realm of <u>ideas</u> has a measurable effect on the instance of those <u>archetypes</u>, i.e.  <u>reality</u> as we know it.  Chapter 11, “*Application of <u>Awareness</u>*”, looks at some of these experiments.

## <u>Reality</u>

What about the possibility that <u>reality</u> itself, the world around us, matter, everything we consider to be real, *is* the <u>memory</u>?  

*Note: This is very related to the information/dark-matter section above*

This idea is based on the idea of Quantum <u>Darwinism</u>[^157] that states that of all the probable states that can exist, the ones that survive do so because of support from their environment.  In turn, these states that survive transfer <u>information</u> to the environment, altering its context, shifting the curve in its favor, and thereby improving the probabilities of future similar states.

[^157]: Dr. Wojciech Zurek of the Los Alamos National Laboratory explains the concept of quantum Darwinism in an interview at the Institute for Quantum Computing that you can see on YouTube at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27zMdaBgt6g>

As the <u>energy</u> interacts with the environment around it, the range of probabilities for the many attributes of an <u>energy</u> particle begins to decohere, or disappear, leaving only the attributes that are most compatible with the environment, which then interacts with the environment to make the environment more compatible with the attributes.  Notice the compatibility of Quantum <u>Darwinism</u> with the descriptions of the social equations in the section “The Meaning of <u>Math</u>” in chapter 8, “*Instances*”, and how quantum <u>Darwinism</u> is a perfect example of context&rightarrow;content &rightarrow;context&rightarrow;etc.

<u>Reality</u>, as we know it, is the consequence of this process of *decohering* the less successful possibilities of a particle’s superposition.  In the end, one set of attributes dominates, and that is what we see in the <u>reality</u> that surrounds us.  In other words, <u>reality</u> itself is the living record of what worked in the past and is currently working.

Applied to the <u>tholonic</u> model, each <u>tholon</u> has a set of stable properties, and given its self-similar <u>structure</u>, each <u>tholon</u> only needs to manage the properties that relate to its <u>scope</u> or that exist within its spectrum, leaving the parent properties to the parents, and any of the child properties to the child.  Each <u>tholon</u> then “knows” what works and expresses this in the instances of that <u>tholon</u>, which is every archetypal idea and form that has the possibility to exist.  When we look at a thing, like a rock, we are not just seeing the <u>evolutionary</u> results of the <u>tholon</u> of a rock, but also the <u>aggregated</u> results of all related tholons; mountain, <u>planet</u>, solar system, galaxy, silica, <u>molecules</u>, <u>atoms</u>, <u>electrons</u>, etc.

The <u>language</u> of <u>reality</u> begins with one “letter” (a <u>tholon</u>) of the alphabet, which becomes three in the next generations, which becomes 12, etc.  Each of these letters is a record of what “works.”

Remember that phrase *<u>combinatorial inflation</u>* which describes the exponentially increasing <u>number</u> of possibilities in <u>protein</u> production? This is the big problem with current <u>evolutionary</u> thought, as there are simply too many combinations for <u>nature</u> to try.

<center><img src='../Images/realtholons.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

In the <u>tholonic</u> model, these massively inflated possibilities are much simpler to navigate.  We start with a <u>duality</u> within which a stable <u>pattern</u> emerges.  From that stable <u>pattern</u>, a new <u>duality</u> emerges, which produces another stable pattern.  For each generation, we have 3 new possible <u>tholons</u> from which <u>patterns</u> can emerge.  Only stable <u>patterns</u> are capable of creating dualities, so unsustainable <u>patterns</u> never propagate.  After a mere 129 generations of this process we have produced 10<sup>77</sup> possible <u>tholonic</u> paths or combinations, but at each generation we only needed to create one pair of parameters (we used 10<sup>77</sup> as that was the possible <u>number</u> of <u>protein</u> combinations with just 20 <u>amino acids</u> and 150 proteins&hellip; a very, very small <u>number</u> when compared to the actual proteins that make up <u>life</u>).

It is clear that the odds are incredibly stacked against a new form of a viable <u>protein</u> to appear because the assumption is the entire <u>field</u> of 10<sup>77</sup> is available.  <u>Tholonically</u>, the entire <u>field</u> available is limited to a mere 3 properties, but these properties are self-similarly embedded in every succeeding generation.  If a new <u>pattern</u> emerged somewhere around the 63<sup>rd</sup> generation (10<sup>37</sup> combinations), then an entire new branch of creation will emerge at a point in the tree where it will have a significant presence at the 129<sup>th</sup> generation.  This would explain the <u>Cambrian Explosion</u> when 541 million years ago a major new class of <u>life</u> appeared that was the origin of all modern marine life.  It also destroys the Darwinian model of long-term evolution.  Ironically, Darwin himself, in his *Origin of <u>Species</u>*, said this nasty detail was the main argument against his “Theory of Descent”.

Here’s a simple mathematical example.

First, let’s look at the <u>Bell curve</u> again.  Let’s say you do 32-coin flips 50,000 times and plot the results.

The peak of the <u>Bell curve</u> is going to tell us what the most likely result will be, which is, that we will get heads 16 out of 32 flips, on average.  But we have decided we are going to run this test 5 times, but each subsequent time we are only going to use the coins that came up heads in the previous test.  If we do this same process five times, we end up with the following:

- Test 1 with 32 coins, 16 came up heads
- Test 2 with 16 coins, 8 came up heads
- Test 3 with 8 coins, 4 came up heads
- Test 4 with 4 coins, 2 came up heads
- Test 5 with 2 coins, 1 came up heads

<center><img src='../Images/101-toincoss.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

So, when we run these 5 tests 50,000 times each, the chances of us ending up with 1 coin from 32 coins is obviously 100%.

Now imagine we use different coins for each test;

- Test 1, 32 quarters
- Test 2, 16 nickels
- Test 3, 8 dimes
- Test 4, 4 half-dollars
- Test 5, 2 pennies.

We start out with 62 coins  (32 quarters, 16 nickels, 8 dimes, 4 half-dollars, and 2 pennies) but end up with 31 coins (16 quarters, 8 nickels, 4 dimes, 2 half-dollars, and 1 penny).

If an observer was blind to the process and only knew that the final result was one penny, but that you started out with 62 coins, they would say there is a 2:62, or 3.2%, chance of you ending up with a penny, when, in fact, you know there is a 100% chance of you ending up with a penny.  That’s 96.8% margin of error vs. 0% margin of error. 

The observer, in an attempt to replicate your success, but not knowing your process, will begin to run tests and keep notes as to what worked and what didn’t work.  He checks these notes every time he runs a new test to make sure he is not doing something that has been shown to fail.  Once he discovers your process, he can archive the failed notes and simply describe the process that works.  He does not need to record all the failures once he has discovered the process that works, but he does so as to pass them on to the next generation of researchers who will approach similar problems in the same bottom-up fashion.

<u>Existence</u> does not need to record its failures as it is the ultimate top-down approach, from the <u>tholonic</u> perspective.  From the very first instance of creation, nothing progressed unless the previous process worked, i.e. new child <u>tholons</u> created from the stable <u>patterns</u> of the parent tholon.  No reverse engineering is necessary for <u>existence</u> as it is an exclusively forward-engineering process.  If a branch of <u>existence</u> fails it will only fail up to the last successful parent.  This is like saying that if all your nickels were swapped out for double-tailed nickels, then all flips after the nickels would come up as <u>zero</u>, killing the entire branch below nickels and preventing any opportunity for the dimes, half-dollars and pennies.  The quarters are still fine, and because you want the tests to continue to <u>work</u> properly, you would need to get new nickels in <u>order</u> to fix the problem.

In our example here, the flipping is analogous to the <u>energy</u> within a <u>tholon</u> creating stable <u>patterns</u> and the experimenter is analogous to the <u>tholonic</u> <u>intelligence</u>, which includes the <u>intelligence</u> that “fixes” the problem when he received feedback from the broken branch (i.e. bad nickels) that modified the curve (skewed results) which resulted in a new stable <u>pattern</u> (good nickels).  (I know this example sounds ridiculously trivial, but it’s the simplest example I could think of.)

From the <u>tholons</u> view, the experimenter and the experiment are a an integral part of the <u>tholonic</u> expression, so the analogy is not only an analogy, but also an instance of the <u>tholonic</u> process.

<img src='../Images/102-tpaths.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>A simple example more aligned to the tholonic model would be how N-states emerge along the Bell curves from which N-sources create new trigrams.  In the image on the right,  this same idea is shown using a Fourier Series of hierarchical circles.  By assigning a value for points on the spectrum, and a binary value representing the generation of the trigram, we can create a unique value for every point that identifies its place on the spectrum and its level.  If we combine each of these numbers, we can create one value for the entire lineage that has an extractable record of the chain of tholons and their spectrum’s value at every level.  This one number would then act as a memory of all the ancestors.  We can see this easily in simple binary math.  If we have 5 generations of numbers that double with each generation, such as 1,2,4,8,16, and we have the number 22 representing the sum of all the contributing generations, we can easily determine that only the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> generations contributed, because only 2, 4, and 16 can create 22.  The tholons are similar in that each tholon has a fingerprint that is encoded in every one of its descendants that describes its path from the original source.

What this means is that everything that exists is *already* a record of what works from the first moment of creation, through every generation, up to and including the thing that exists.  <u>Life</u>, <u>Reality</u>, and Everything *is* the warehouse of all knowledge.  We just haven’t yet figured out how to decode (most of) it. We demonstrated an example of the binary qualities of <u>tholonic</u> counting earlier (the companion book “*The <u>Tholonic</u> I-Ching*” specifically addresses this and shows exactly how each <u>tholon</u> has a naturally existing binary signature).  It may actually be the case that a thing itself ***is*** the value of that tholon.  We think of <u>numbers</u> as digits, but in some unfathomably complex and multidimensional <u>reality</u>, perhaps the cumulative value of a *thing* is expressed not as <u>numbers</u>, but as the *thing* itself, which we can only perceive as a simple object as that *thing* is instantiated over time in our 3D world.

### Hidden <u>Data</u>
<img src='../Images/wavetypes2.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>This is similar in concept to the way a piece of music is the combination of many *atoms* of sound (yes, that’s a real thing, and it’s about 0.093 seconds[^158]), each an aggregate of many individual frequencies.  Over time, these frequencies change, resulting in “music” because we have the abilities to “decode” those frequencies, thanks to the cooperative functions of our auditory cortex, cerebrum, cerebellum, and limbic system.  We can also decode waves using such concepts as the Fourier Transform which allow us to  discover all of a waves components, but that does not mean we can recognize what information is contained in that wave.  For example, there can be images encoded in frequencies that no analysis will discover unless we know what to look for, such as the image of Barack Obama encoded into sound (Image right. For more examples, see *Appendix E*, “*Hidden Images*”)

<img src="../Images/elvis.png" style="float:right;width:30%"/>Another example of this that demonstrates some very tholonic concepts is a photo-mosaic, which is an image that is made up of other images, such as this image of Elvis that is made up of many images of Elvis.  Now, imagine an image made up of many images which are made up of many images, and so on, but instead of the patterns being that of an image, imagine the patterns as that of energy and awareness, with each image having its own intelligence and intention.  While almost any collection of images can be used to create any other type of image, this is far less so the case when we are speaking of tholons, which are effectively living expressions of energy, intention, intelligence, and awareness.  There are many more dimensions and constraints, such as the law of entropy, so some tholons will be more likely to form other tholons depending on the “benefits”,  such as conserving energy or enhancing adaptation, to both the defining and contributing tholons.

Just for fun, here is the human eye made only from images used in this book, and a bull skull in Death Valley made with blooming flowers.

### Brownian <u>Archetypes</u>

These images are meant to demonstrate how <u>information</u> can be composed of <u>information</u>, and how any one piece of <u>information</u> is both composed of smaller pieces and is part of a larger piece.  So, how can we even begin to decode such <u>information</u>?  One thing we can do is look at how <u>information</u> “progresses”.  The multiple generations of embedded images, or <u>tholons</u>, or <u>fractal</u> <u>patterns</u>, represent unique paths, or lineages, that start from one point but end up at many points.  The progression of these lineages are not predictable, but are not random.  They are the result of expanding <u>energy</u> moving forward in time, diverging from one <u>archetype</u> and <u>converging</u> toward others, not unlike Brownian <u>movement</u> (examples shown below).

<center><img src='../Images/brownian.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This claim is based on the fact that Brownian and Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) is an <u>archetype</u> for, and can describe,  rivers [^352]<sup>,</sup>[^353], trees[^354], <u>neurology</u>[^355], landscapes, and appears to be fundamental to all organic growth.

In all cases, the paths of growth will be determined by the basic rules of:

- All <u>movement</u> will always seek the path of least resistance.

- Paths of least <u>resistance</u> will form patterns.

- <u>Patterns</u> form archetypes.

- <u>Energy</u> (movement) is always diverging (and <u>converging</u>?) *from* one <u>archetype</u> *towards* another archetype.

- All <u>movement</u> is a an expression of <u>energy</u> seeking a balance.

There is much more to the significance of Brownian mechanics, at least from the <u>tholonic</u> view, but this reasoning is well outside the acceptable limits of scientific thinking.  The reader can decide whether the following its worthy of consideration. 

The “jitters” in Brownian motion are caused by external forces.  For physical things, like amoebas and pollen, this can be collisions with other particles.  For things like <u>information</u>, this can be “<u>noise</u>”, such as the small  transactions of buying and selling when looking at the <u>stock market</u> as a whole.  In general, the larger the object, the less effect these smaller influences have.  A falling spec of dust will have Brownian <u>movement</u>, but a falling rock will not.  A huge move in the market will be unaffected by small transactions.  This same <u>concept</u> applies to <u>energy</u> <u>fields</u>, such as <u>electricity</u> or radio <u>waves</u>, and we see examples of external forces affecting these <u>fields</u> in electromagnetic <u>interference</u> of solar flares, auroras, or ignition systems.

This last reference will be obscure to the under-50 readers, but once upon a time, when I lived in a small rural New England town, if I had the radio on in the house and a car drove by with a poorly insulated ignition system, (very common in the 60s) I could hear the ignition system sending pulses to the spark plugs as clicks.  Without even seeing the car, I could know how fast they were going, *if* they had an automatic transmission.  If they had a manual transmission and I could see how fast the car was moving, I could tell if they were going too fast for 2<sup>rd</sup> gear or too slow for 3<sup>rd</sup>, thereby discovering that Mrs. Brown, the 2<sup>nd</sup> grade school teacher, was a far better driver than the Police Chief, who also owned the slaughterhouse.  This “inside information” was simply due to this annoying “noise” of field interference.  Were I a mechanic, I could have used this data to do some pre-digital, data-mined, targeted sales. Today, we can hear a distant person’s voice by the interference of light and sound waves bouncing off a box of nearby box of tissues.  In the same manner, we can learn learn things about the Sun based on how solar flares disturb television transmissions

<img src='../Images/interference.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>If someone was aware of how fields interfere with each other, and they happened to be watching the TV transmission on October 8, 2002, which was disturbed by a solar flare 93,000,000 miles from Earth, the fuzzy dots on the screen would be telling them to bring in the tomatoes, stock up on firewood, and make sure all the flashlights in the house worked, because they would also know that this field disruption can also disturb other types of fields which could result in electrical outages, crazy weather, and even earthquakes.  This same reasoning applies to the thologram, as the first, and largest, tholon is unaffected by any external forces, while the tholons on the edge of creation, that *boundary layer* between order and chaos, where *somethingness* expands into *nothingness*, are bombarded by the external forces of the countless surrounding tholonic fields.   

<img src='../Images/forces.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>The difference between particles and data, instances and archetypes, is that particle movement is also affected by gravity.  The smaller the particle, the more effect external forces have and the less effect gravity has.  The dominance of external forces vs. gravity is well known.  *Note: Gravity is a real force, but not in the traditional sense of direct, classical, action-at-a-distance force between two objects.* 

How does <u>gravity</u> relate to <u>tholons</u>?  If we momentarily accept the hypothesis previously mentioned that <u>gravity</u> is an instance of <u>awareness</u> (consciousness), then can we speculate that in the non-physical realm of <u>tholons</u>, <u>concepts</u>, <u>ideas</u>, etc., we would see a similar <u>pattern</u>, but replacing <u>gravity</u> with <u>awareness</u> or <u>consciousness</u>?  What would this tell us?  The first thing we would see is that the first <u>tholon</u> would be all encompassing, and instantiate as pure <u>awareness</u> and define the limits of all that it contains.  All measurements are relative to these initial limits, for example, *c*, the speed of light.  As the first <u>tholon</u> is in a void of <u>nothingness</u>, it cannot be measured relative to anything else. 

The parallel might also suggest that “large” and stable <u>concepts</u>, such as <u>religious</u>, political, <u>economic</u>, or ideological <u>concepts</u>, have a <u>conceptual</u> “gravitational” <u>force</u>, which pull other smaller <u>concepts</u> into their “orbit”, and perhaps absorbing them completely.  And, as the <u>singularity</u> of the 0 dimensional dot represents the <u>singularity</u> of the <u>Big Bang</u>, which was infinite <u>gravity</u>, that 0 dimensional dot of A&I is like the “<u>black hole</u>” of <u>concepts</u>, ultimately absorbing all.  This would certainly explain why otherwise rational and intelligent people can advocate for dysfunctional, inaccurate and even destructive concepts.  This seemingly self-destructive behavior is <u>tholonically</u> compatible because from the <u>tholonic</u> view, the only thing that matters is if a <u>concept</u> can survive, and the more <u>awareness</u> that is applied to a <u>concept</u> the more “<u>gravity</u>” it has, <u>conceptually</u> speaking.

### Relative <u>Archetypes</u>

This is somewhat similar to Relativity Theory, but we are not going to get into the details of Special Relativity, General Relativity, Lorentz Transformations, and all the other stuff that such topics inevitably led to.  Instead, we will just state the following: The <u>speed of light</u> is symbolized as *c*, but *c* is actually the *speed of causality*; it is the maximum speed at which any two parts of the <u>Universe</u> can interact, or the *speed of cause and effect*.  This includes the <u>speed of light</u>, <u>gravity</u> <u>waves</u>, <u>gluons</u>, or anything that has no mass.  Were *c* infinite, as was once believed, cause and effect would happen instantly, and all of <u>existence</u> would be one short lived but very intense blip, and then over. 

Time would also not exist if *c* was infinite because everything would happen instantly, so the fact that *c* does have a limit is why time exists, as time is a measure of the speed of causality.  Remember that *m=E/c<sup>2</sup>*? This means <u>mass</u> is <u>energy</u> divided by *c*<sup>2</sup>, or 8.98755179 × 10<sup>16</sup> meters<sup>2</sup> / secs<sup>2</sup>.  That is a pretty, pretty big reduction of energy.  <u>Mass</u> is really, really slow <u>energy</u>, and by “slow” we mean a reduction in the speed of causality, and by that we mean, <u>mass</u> moves slower that energy.  Before you think to yourself “Duh!”, imagine what that means on a cosmic scale.  Only <u>mass</u> has <u>gravity</u>, and <u>mass</u> is slow <u>energy</u>, and slow <u>energy</u> is the result of time, and time is the speed of causality, ergo, the more <u>mass</u>, the slower the time.  And that is exactly what we see.  The more <u>gravity</u>, the slower the time.  Clocks on <u>earth</u> tick slower that clocks in space.  The current thinking that it is time that creates <u>gravity</u> can also be thought of as the slower speed of causality causing <u>gravity</u>, and the more the <u>mass</u>, the slower that causality, all the way up to a <u>black hole</u> where time stops at the event horizon.  Yes, there is no time inside a <u>black hole</u>, and having no time, it can not have <u>space-time</u>, but does have infinite gravity.  This is why a <u>black hole</u> is said to have 0 volume.  It is, in fact, a 0-dimensional point, a <u>singularity</u>, making <u>black holes</u> no more than a <u>concept</u>, but a <u>concept</u> that shapes our universe.  

In the <u>tholonic</u> model, if *E* (energy) is A&I, the originating *N-source*, then *Definition/limitation* (via *c*) creates *time*, resulting in the *Contribution/integration* quality of *space*.  Yes, from a relativistic view, space and time are 2 sides to the <u>space-time</u> coin and both came into <u>existence</u> together.  From the <u>tholonic</u> view, while they did come into <u>existence</u> together, there is still a path of their creation.  All <u>numbers</u> came into <u>existence</u> simultaneously, but we still have to go through 2 to get to 3.  We now have a spectrum of <u>space-time</u> across which many <u>patterns</u> will form.  Presumably, the first <u>patterns</u> formed on this spectrum were things like the EM <u>radiation</u> followed by matter and the gravitational <u>fields</u>, or, if you prefer the alternative theory of the <u>Big Bang</u>, the gravitational <u>fields</u> came before matter and were so strong they created matter. Either way, EM <u>radiation</u>, <u>gravity</u>, and possibly matter, are the first instantiations of A&I.  Perhaps EM <u>radiation</u> is an instance of <u>Awareness</u> and <u>gravity</u> is in instance of <u>Intention</u>, as these pairings are <u>conceptually</u> equivalent in many ways.  <u>Culturally</u>, we have equated light (EM <u>radiation</u>) with <u>awareness</u>, as in the *enlightened* who have heightened <u>awareness</u>, and the <u>concept</u> of *<u>gravity</u>* with the weight of serious goals, aims, purpose, responsibility, stability, etc., as in the *gravitas* of a deep thinker.

The <u>concepts</u> of Relativity map nicely onto the <u>tholonic</u> model and can tell us a lot about how <u>tholons</u> functions.  The Brownian <u>concepts</u> tell us more about the <u>tholon</u> as a whole, suggesting that the smaller <u>tholons</u> are more controlled by external forces, or circumstances, than <u>awareness</u>, but always have *some* element of awareness.  This idea also fits nicely with the <u>tholonic</u> view of the <u>reality</u> that rocks, chairs and toasters do not have any observable form of <u>awareness</u>, but <u>tholonically</u> have *some* element of awareness. 

From the <u>tholonic</u> view, all of <u>existence</u>, in one form or another, is an instance of A&I, but that which is alive, which grows and reproduces, are the first *observable* instances of <u>consciousness</u> if we don’t consider the far broader <u>tholonic</u> definition of “living organism”, which would include <u>planets</u>, galaxies, and the Universe.  Of these living organisms, some appear to have the ability to consciously direct their intentions, independent of any biological needs or instincts. One might call that *free will*, but we’ll avoid that prickly <u>concept</u> for now (as we address it later). What can be said is, the more A&I is instantiated, the more <u>energy</u> that is in motion, the more <u>microstates</u> of expansion available, the higher the <u>entropy</u>, the greater the <u>balancing</u> potential.

### The Return to <u>Nothingness</u>

<img src='../Images/EGM.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>If you drop a rock in a still pond, there is a big splash, then a bunch of waves that spread out as the energy of the impact disturbs the still water.  Eventually, everything calms down and the water is calm again.  The inevitable return to calm is due to entropy, but entropy cannot exist without gravity.  Entropy, gravity and mass is one of the *uber*-trinities upon which this 3-dimensional space-time reality is built.  Remove any one of these elements, and reality, as we know it, ceases to exist. If we can say the water returns to calm due to entropy, we can also say it is due to mass and/or gravity.  That’s why the concept of entropy was invented, as it’s easier to deal with than having to continually calculate the loss of heat of energy over time, the amount of heat due to friction, the force of that friction based on the masses involved (with their own gravitational fields), etc., etc.

The <u>Big Bang</u> was that rock that got dropped in the still waters of the void.  There was a splash, and we are currently riding the <u>waves</u> of that disturbance, but eventually, the <u>Universe</u> will return to a state of calm, perhaps even the <u>nothingness</u> it once was.  More to the point, if everything that exists is preceded by its <u>archetypes</u>, and <u>archetypes</u> are formed by stable <u>patterns</u> as a result of the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u>, then all <u>movement</u> is either diverging from one <u>archetype</u> or <u>converging</u> towards another (or others).

In the case of the pond, the <u>archetype</u> it diverged from when it was disturbed was that of a *Still Pond*, and after the disturbance, the <u>archetype</u> it returns to is also that of a *Still Pond*, but the instance of the *Still Pond* has been changed slightly by the disturbance.  Technically, the same could be said about the rock, but as the rock was essentially unchanged by dropping it into the water, the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> was inconsequential, at least for this example.  If a ton of water was dropped into the pond, things would be a lot more complicated, but the fundamentals would be the same&hellip; the <u>movement</u> of <u>energy</u> that diverges from its most stable archetype(s) goes through many changes and forms many <u>patterns</u> and <u>archetypes</u> in the process of returning to the most stable <u>pattern</u> possible.  If the context is changed as a result of the disturbance, for example, rather than a rock, a meteor, then the resulting <u>archetypes</u> will not be the same as the initial archetypes.  As there is only one <u>archetype</u> that has an absolute context, then it is that <u>archetype</u> that all other <u>archetypes</u> and all <u>energy</u> ultimately tends towards, and that is the first <u>archetype</u>, which is created by the 0D dot of A&I.

<img src='../Images/4forces.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>The tholonic model requires that every sustainable archetype instantiates in some form in the physical world, as that is an inevitable consequence of, and prerequisite for, its sustainability. Where can we find an instance of this primal archetype that all energy tends towards and will eventually arrive at?  Not surprisingly, the obvious candidate is the *Standard Model*, or the 4 fundamental forces of nature, which are: the strong force, electromagnetic force, the weak force, and gravity.  These forces are a good example of 2 forces, *attraction* and *charge*,  in the 2 contexts of parent and child.  The stronger force of attraction holds together matter (gravity) and nuclei (strong force).  The the weaker force transfers energy waves (electromagnetic force) and energy particles (weak force of the W and Z *boson* particles that can transform neutrons to protons and neutrinos to electrons).

The <u>atomic</u> forces apply in the contextual range of the size of the nucleus, or about 10<sup>-13</sup> meters.  The universal forces apply in the context of the <u>Universe</u> and extend to the edge of the universe.  *(Note: Technically, the EM <u>force</u> is greater than <u>gravity</u>, but as there can be negative EM forces, and there can’t be negative <u>mass</u>, the EM <u>force</u> can be neutralized or less than 0, while <u>gravity</u> can only be lessened and can never be 0 or less.)* While all <u>mass</u> can be effected by the EM <u>force</u>, only the <u>force</u> of <u>gravity</u> exerts a constant pull.  <u>Gravity</u> is the <u>force</u> that all matter tends towards, making <u>gravity</u> the <u>archetype</u> that all <u>energy</u> tends towards.

<u>Science</u> has theorized that at the end of time there will be nothing left in the <u>Universe</u> except the <u>black holes</u> that all matter has fallen into due to their immense gravitational pull.  This gravitational <u>field</u> at a point of a <u>black hole</u> <u>singularity</u> can (we think) infinitely warp space-time.  <u>Science</u> can only guess how that will effect the *Strong Nuclear <u>Force</u>*, but it’s probably safe to say that if time and space go bye-bye, the SNF won’t function the same way.  It is most likely that the <u>black hole</u> destroys all <u>structure</u> down to the quantum level, creating a ball of pure, dense, concentrated&hellip;“stuff”.  These <u>black holes</u> then slowly radiate their “stuff” away over the next 3&times;10<sup>107</sup> years, leaving a perfect void of nothingness.  <u>Science</u> has a problem with this, and they call it the “<u>Information</u> paradox”, because according to <u>science</u>, everything can’t just disappear into a void of <u>nothingness</u>, but according to this theory, it does, so they are diligently working to come up with various solutions to this paradox that use wormholes, quantum effects, “Fuzzballs”, and “Soft-Hair”  (actual names) theories.  A few existential scientists think that, yes, in the end, everything returns to nothingness.

However, if we can accept the idea that the fundamental <u>archetype</u> for matter (gravity) is an instance of the fundamental <u>archetype</u> for <u>consciousness</u> (A&I), as some scientists have already suggested, then while the material world may return to <u>nothingness</u>, the A&I that started it all has not, because, being a 0D <u>concept</u>, it can’t be destroyed because it doesn't actually exist.  Perhaps that is why new Big Bangs, new instances of the first <u>movement</u> of <u>Awareness</u> and <u>Intention</u>, and the new universes they create, can, according to at least one theory, occur *within* the <u>Black Holes</u>, just as this <u>Universe</u> is inside some <u>Black Hole</u> “somewhere else” in “<u>reality</u>”.

These highly speculative <u>ideas</u> are primarily meant to explore how existing <u>concepts</u> can be applied to new contexts.  Perhaps they are useless, but more likely, they will offer *some* insights into new territories, from *spontaneous deduction* and  *mutual <u>knowledge</u>*[^351] to multidimensional communication and travel.
