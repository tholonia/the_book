# 12: PREDETERMINISM

###### Free will exists, but its options are limited

Remember the explanation of how a lightning rod works?  It simply creates a path of least resistance between two different states that seek balance, and, as energy always travels the path of least resistance, lightning will always seek the lightning rod over a brick chimney.  We can say that the path of the lightning was predetermined by the laws of physics before the lightning event just as we can say that the lightning only came into existence because such a path even existed in the first place.  In other words, the instance of lightning is a consequence of the preexisting energy fields.

The same concept holds for the thologram in that there can be almost countless combinations of archetypes, and therefore almost countless connections of tholons between the “beginning” and the “end”.  This implies that within the thologram exists every path of creation and/or growth that is possible *at that moment in time*, but the paths that will be traveled are those that represent the path of least resistance, and what we see as reality around us is a consequence of energy moving through those paths.

As new combinations come into being, new paths emerge, but for the most part, these new paths will emerge from the “bottom”, or end-points of the hierarchy, as these are the most unstable and dynamic, similar to the unstable borders of a fractal.  Each tholon represents a “step” in the path.  New paths are rarer as we move up the hierarchy as these higher-order tholons have achieved a stable state that is held in place by the induction of their parents and children, and short of a radical change in energy, they will not change.  The force of the energy that would be needed to affect a change is inversely proportional to their ancestors and proportional to their descendants.  This is why reality “is confined by rules that may be shockingly narrow”, to quote Charles S. Cockell  from his book “*The Equations of Life: How Physics Shapes Evolution*” and suggests that form and life across the universe may not vary as much as we might imagine.

An example of these new emerging paths would be the creation of a new element in the periodic chart.  All elements past the element of uranium are man-made, so they are new creations, but they are also extremely unstable, unsustainable and don’t last very long.  A new stable path even a little way up from the “bottom” would dramatically alter reality.

Starting from the beginning, immediately upon the first awareness of a non-existent dot in the void of nothingness, that SAI began self-replicating into smaller and smaller divisions.  These divisions stop at some point where no sustainable patterns can be achieved, perhaps because the difference is too small or weak,  or other reasons.  The depth of a tholon’s scope can be described as the difference between two states, the delta of the duality of that scope, similar to the definition of voltage we saw above, which presumably gets smaller and smaller with each generation (but not necessarily).

As the parents and children of a tholon change, so too will that tholon adapt to these changes by having its scope adjusted.  In doing so, the thologram is *problem-solving* in real-time.  More than that, it is doing this in a heuristic manner, i.e. a manner based on experience.  How? Because the (only successful) changes that have been made in the past resulted in changes to the entire thologram and the consequence of those changes define the context of each tholon’s current condition.

The working hypothesis is that the thologram has a memory of everything that has ever happened to it that resulted in a successful change, and this is all recorded and passed on through each tholon that is created.  However, there can be many tholons occupying the same space because of the embedded nature of tholons, so if you reference a tholon at the “bottom” of the thologram, you are implicitly referencing every parent tholon back to the very first tholon.  What this suggests is that any instance of a tholon is also an implicit reference to many tholons and the path that connects them.

What this tells us is that each instance is a 3D perspective of a very multi-dimensional form of energy that describes one “path” from the first tholon to the tholon in question but which we 3D dwellers experience as past, present, and future (like the 3D ball passing through 2D space example previously).

Two strangers, Bob and Carol, bump into each other at the butcher shop.  This interaction is the result of countless steps that had to happen starting with the Big Bang.  The path from the first moment of creation to the current instance that it took for Bob and his ancestors to arrive at this point and time we’ll call path B, and the same for Carol we’ll call path C.  Path B and path C already existed in the thologram, and Bob and Carol just happen to be the current instance of the fields of these two paths that connected because it was the path of least resistance, for whatever reasons, like the two fields that connected to create lightning.  There are effectively an infinite number of paths and their fields, but the point where Bob and Carol meet is the only point where the two fields, of which they are the current instances of, connect.  If reality itself is the memory store then anything that emerges from this meeting will inherit the “implicit information” of both paths that lead to their meeting.

<img src='../Images/graphs-vertical.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>Every path that can be traveled by any instance already exists because the fields already exist.  The path is the expression of the fields interacting.  We tend to wander through this matrix of possibilities in a manner that appears aimless, similar to the manner bacteria wander about in their puddles of plasma, but from the tholonic perspective, these paths are determined by various cooperative and competing tholonic fields.

Perhaps one of the best instance of this that is easily understood is music.  Consider that a finite number of notes exist, but within those notes an almost infinite number of tunes can be written.  If we mapped every combination of notes, the tune could be seen as a path on that map.  This is more than just a thought experiment… it’s an actual undertaking by music theorist Julian Cook, who described in his article  “*Mapping the Music*”,[^178] how the harmonic path of a Beethoven sonata can be visualized on a *Tonnetz* graph (left)&hellip; a graph that happens to look just like a 2D tholon map.  In this example, the notes are acting like the fields, and the playing of those notes represents energy moving through these fields, forming music, or lightning, plants, rivers, neurons, and everything else.

Music also demonstrates how certain patterns can lay down the foundations upon which other patterns and expressions build upon.  For example, there are many different types of scales, such as *pentatonic*, which has 5 notes per octave, or the *Western Major Scale*, with the classic 7 notes most Westerners are used to.  Sound occurs when energy is applied to matter, and notes represent the *dots* that we have identified within that chaos of white noise through our power of reasoning.  We form patterns and connect these dots that exist in the sea of chaos that is all sound, and by doing so we create “music”.  We describe white noise as all frequencies expressed at once, but it is equally accurate to describe white noise as every possible pattern of all possible notes being performed at once.  This tells us that all possible forms of music, all songs, rhythms, beats, arrangements, etc., already exist within that white noise and all that we can do is discover them.

This discovery is not limited to humans, as we see this same thing in song birds.  Of course, believing this will depend on which church of science you are faithful to.

In 2012, *Science Magazine* published a article citing a report from the *Journal of Animal Behavior* titled “*Is birdsong music? Evaluating harmonic intervals in songs of a Neotropical songbird*”[^311] that concluded that  any musicality we might hear in a bird’s song is nothing more than projection on the human’s part.  Two years later, however, they published an article that cites a later study from the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, titled “*Overtone-based pitch selection in hermit thrush song: Unexpected convergence with scale construction in human music*”[^310], which concluded that birds most likely choose the notes they sing, and that these notes are the same notes that we humans have also selected to create our musical scales.

The tholonic position is simply that some patterns are more stable and efficient than others, such as the harmonic series, so we would expect to see it in music, bird songs, fungal growth, orbits, and countless other contexts.

Even in the world of bacterial meandering, we see a pattern.  Not surprisingly, it is the inverse of a Bell curve, in that a group of bacteria released at the same time starts out relatively coherent and eventually disperses to incoherence.  It’s almost (or exactly) as if the instances of creations emerge from a tholon’s Bell curve in a manner inverse to that Bell curve, like a kind of balancing factor, much like the way a positive charge will automatically create a pairing with a negative charge, or how the amount of water that falls to the earth (rain) is equivalent to the amount of water that rises into the sky (evaporation) from the earth.  States of order create states of chaos, which create new states of order.

#### **Key 79:** Archetypes tend toward order, while the instances tend toward chaos.


In the early generations of the thologram, the numbers of paths are limited, and with the additional generations, the number of paths increase.  This movement may appear random, but not only does it disperse according to a Bell curve, it actually follows the same rules as the thologram itself in that it is self-similar and fractal in nature.[^179]

<center><img src='../Images/105-brownian-growth.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Although this sounds like predeterminism, which it effectively is, there are so many paths that can be traveled that for all intents and purposes predeterminism doesn’t apply.  Tholonically speaking, it appears as though we may have free will, but only with regard in determining which predetermined path we follow.  It also looks like existence itself is the unfolding, explicating, instantiating of every possible combination of sustainable patterns that exist to establish a balance between differing fields.

Although a bit of a tangent, and certainly worthy of more than a paragraph, it’s worth stating here that the idea of reincarnation has a tholonic explanation, which is: What some people believe to be past life experiences are collective memories associated with the path we happen to be instantiating, or traveling, if you will, and which we identify with mainly due to our ego’s nature to relate these inherited and embedded memories (and everything else, apparently) to one’s self.  This is why many people who believe in reincarnation will also believe they were some grand historical figure in a past life, as there will naturally be more instances (of people) in these well-worn paths of current archetypes simply because these paths are the paths of lesser resistance.

Applying this idea of multiple (and overlapping) instances to the thologram, there are different patterns that dominate our reality at different times, and as these patterns represent the instances that make up our reality, we can say that reality, from atoms to ideas, also differs across time.  In fact, the concept of an atom itself exists only because it is based on the patterns of reality we happen to be discovering at this point in our journey, but at other times in the past, and future, this concept will change, or disappear altogether.  There was (or will be) a time when what we see as atoms are seen as spirits, or perhaps facets of a larger intelligence, or a 3D projection of a 248D magic crystal, something we are incapable of imagining at this time.  The laws that control atoms, now and in the future, will also apply to “spirits” or intelligences, or however we choose to see them, but these laws will also be understood within the context and scope of the time.  Keep in mind that in the last 90 years alone, the model of the electron has morphed from a type of “mist” (1905), to little orbiting particles (1911), to standing wave patterns (1924), to the probability fields of quantum mechanics that extent to the edge of an entangled universe (1926).

While every tholon is unique, its instances will usually be very similar. There is one archetype for a human, but there are many types of human instances.  There is no reason why there couldn’t be multiple near-identical instances of a tholon, and many reasons why there could be.  This concept has been around for a long time in the form of doppelgangers, twin strangers, alter egos, changelings, and has found a new home in concepts such as cloning and the multiverse.  Metaphysics has a similar concept of a *soul family*, which are groups of souls that share much of the same “structure”,  metaphysical DNA, so to speak, as they are part of the same collective of a larger “soul”.  It’s natural that such concepts would appear as we see this concept manifest in nature, especially among living organisms; many leaves from one branch, many branches from one tree, many trees from one root system.  Modern science, with the discovery of DNA, only adds support for this concept.

Tholons are more than just archetypes of things.  They are also archetypes of ideas, contexts, situations, experiences, concepts. Here are some of the more popular or well-known stories of “coincidences” that, when viewed tholonically, might offer insight.[^180]

### Laura Buxton

<img src='../Images/buxtons.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>In June of 2001, a 10-year-old girl named Laura Buxton released a balloon with her name and address on it.  That balloon floated 140 miles and landed in the back yard of a house where also lived a 10 year old girl named Laura Buxton.  On the day of the meeting, the two girls wore essentially the same outfit — a pink sweater and jeans.  The girls were the same height, which was unusual because they were both tall for their age.  They both had brown hair and wore it in the same style.  They both had three-year-old black Labrador Retrievers at home, as well as gray pet rabbits.  They both had guinea pigs, which were the same color and even had the same orange markings on their hindquarters.  It was almost as though these two Laura Buxtons were the same person.[^181] On the right is a picture of the two Laura Buxtons, who are still friends today.

*Here there are two contextually separated instances of one tholonic path.  What is fascinating about this is that the two instances, being of one archetype, would naturally have an existing connection with some opposing attributes, like how a photon, when split, has two opposing spins that are forever entangled. This connection, or entanglement, was instantiated via the red balloon that carried the address between the receiving side and the transmission side of this split instance.*

### King Umberto I’s double

In Monza, Italy, King Umberto I went to a small restaurant for dinner, accompanied by his aide-de-camp, General Emilio Ponzia-Vaglia.  When the owner took King Umberto’s order, the King noticed that he and the restaurant owner were virtual doubles, in face and in build.  Both men began discussing the striking resemblances between each other and found many more similarities.

- Both men were born on the same day, of the same year (March 14<sup>th</sup>, 1844).
- Both men had been born in the same town.
- Both men married a woman with the same name, Margherita.
- The restaurateur opened his restaurant on the same day that King Umberto was crowned King of Italy.
- On 29th July 1900, King Umberto was informed that the restaurateur had died that day in a mysterious shooting accident.  As he expressed his regret he was assassinated by an anarchist in the crowd.

*This looks like one archetype that instantiated in two different contexts.  This may also suggest that tholonic contexts are also archetypal, meaning there are “archetypal contexts” and “instantiated contexts”.*

### Twin boys, twin lives

Twin Ohio boys were separated at birth and adopted by different families.  Unknown to each other, both families named the boys James.  Both James grew up not even knowing of the other, yet both sought law-enforcement training, both had abilities in mechanical drawing and carpentry, and each had married women named Linda.  They both had sons whom one named James Alan and the other named James Allan.  The twin brothers also divorced their wives and married other women, both named Betty.  And they both owned dogs which they named Toy.  Forty years after their childhood separation, the two men were reunited.  (Source: Reader’s Digest, January 1980)

*This looks like two instances of the same tholon and context at birth, both of which traveled a similar path but in different contexts after birth.*

### Three strangers on a train

In the 1920s, three Englishman were traveling separately by train through Peru.  At the time of their introduction, they were the only three men in the railroad car.  Their introductions were more surprising than they could have imagined.  One man’s last name was Bingham, and the second man’s last name was Powell.  The third man announced that his last name was Bingham-Powell.  None were related in any way.  (Source: Mysteries of the Unexplained)

*Here, these three men, although having different lives, clearly shared some other details.  Does this suggest that even our names can be instances of a pattern? I have some experience with this personally.  For my entire life I have been fascinated with the lore of El Paso, Texas.  I had never been to El Paso prior to when I drove through the West Texas desert town in my 40s at around 4 AM in the morning.  It was an ugly town, but I found it incredibly alluring, for reasons I could not explain.  Years later I discovered that the a well known Old West lawman of El Paso, and I, shared the same name.  I can’t say if that is why I felt the way I did about El Paso, but there is no question that my name and El Paso share a strong tholonic bond, so some resonance would exist between these two concepts.*

### Richard Parker

Edgar Allan Poe wrote a story called “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym”.  This was a story about four survivors of a shipwreck who were in an open boat for many days before they decided to kill and eat the cabin boy whose name was Richard Parker.  Some years later, in 1884, the *Mignonette*, a 52 foot English Yacht, was capsized by a wave as they were traveling northwest of the Cape of Good Hope.  The four survivors found themselves together in an open boat for many days.  Eventually, the three senior members of the crew killed and ate the cabin boy, whose name was Richard Parker.

*Here a pattern took form as both a story and an experience.  Perhaps Poe was able to tune into certain patterns and share them.  Perhaps that is what creativity or genius is; the ability to tap into patterns that have yet to become instantiated.  p.s.  The men served only six months in prison and were then released.  They were the first men to ever serve time for cannibalism and murder on the high seas because it was considered a “custom of the sea”.  See “Her Majesty The Queen v. Tom Dudley and Edwin Stephens”, High Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division, 1884*.

### A writer’s plum pudding

In 1805, French writer Émile Deschamps was treated to some plum pudding by the stranger Monsieur de Fortgibu.  Ten years later, he encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fortgibu.  Many years later in 1832 Émile Deschamps was at a diner and was once again offered plum pudding.  He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fortgibu was missing to make the setting complete and in the same instant the now senile de Fortgibu entered the room.

*This seems to be a very specific, yet persistence, pattern that required plum pudding and only instantiated when Deschamps and de Fortgibu were near one another.*

### A novel that unsuspectingly described the spy next door

When Norman Mailer began his novel *Barbary Shore*, there was no plan to have a Russian spy as a character.  As he worked on it, he introduced a Russian spy in the U.S. as a minor character.  As the work progressed, the spy became the dominant character in the novel.  After the novel was completed, the U.S. Immigration Service arrested a man who lived just one floor above Mailer in the same apartment building.  He was Colonel Rudolf Abel, alleged to be the top Russian spy working in the U.S. at that time.  (Source: Science Digest)

*Here is an example of pattern instantiating while at the same time being perceived and recorded by a bystander, similar to the Poe story, but in real-time, and again, in close proximity.*

### A falling baby saved twice by the same man

In Detroit sometime in the 1930s, a young (if incredibly careless) mother must have been eternally grateful to a man named Joseph Figlock.  As Figlock was walking down the street, the mother’s baby fell from a high window onto Figlock.  The baby’s fall was broken and both man and baby were unharmed.  One year later, the very same baby fell from the very same window onto the very same Joseph Figlock as he was again passing beneath.  And again, they both survived the event.  (Source: Mysteries of the Unexplained)

*If proximity is a factor, we have to wonder, if Figlock never walked down that street, would the baby have ever fallen?*

### A determined bullet

 In 1883, Henry Ziegland broke off a relationship with his girlfriend who, out of distress, committed suicide.  The girl’s brother was so enraged that he hunted down Ziegland and shot him.  The brother, believing he had killed Ziegland, then turned his gun on himself and took his own life.  But Ziegland had not been killed.  The bullet, in fact, had only grazed his face and then lodged in a tree.  Some years later, Ziegland decided to cut down the large tree, which still had the bullet in it.  The task seemed so formidable that he decided to blow it up with a few sticks of dynamite.  The explosion propelled the bullet into Zealand’s head, killing him.  (Source: Ripley’s Believe It or Not!)

*The pattern here is the bullet and the intention behind it.  Intentions alone can be their own pattern.  Here, it appears as though the archetype of the intention and the instance of the bullet formed a relationship with its own intention.*

From one perspective you could see all these stories as extremely unlikely coincidences.  From the tholonic perspective, each of these paths and each of these profiles are some of the almost countless patterns that managed to attain enough stability to instantiate.  One details that is very telling is what appears to be the proximity plays.  This would be expected is there was a strong tholonic field for these particular instances.

### Realistically Speaking

The above accounts represent some of the more extreme and rare instances of “coincidences” that are neat and clear.  In most cases they tend to be far more comical, confusing, and messy, like so much of life.  A more practical example that everyone can probably relate to is the following account that a reader shared after reading the above cases.

> This personal anecdote seems related to this chapter: I had a "Jessie" thing in my earlier life—many of them accumulated. Only part of that was—I was married to Jessie (#1) (whose boss's name was Jessie), and had an affair with a man named Jessie (#2), who was born in the town of Nelson. He had a wife named Lynn, a son named Alexander, and a daughter named Anastasia. My best male friend (who later became my 2nd husband) was named Nelson. His wife's name was Jessie and his girlfriend's name was Lynn. My middle name was Lynn. When I was expecting my second child, (not yet knowing the names of Jessie’s (#2) two children) I thought I might name a boy Alexander or a daughter Anastasia. I always thought this was weird and I didn't understand it. You've helped me understand it. (These are the things you don't put in fiction because they're TOO weird and fiction is supposed to make sense).

## Life, Death, Afterlife 

Every creation, including tholons, goes through the cycles of instantiation, this being inception, gestation, emergence, propagation, culmination, and dispersion.  This is just one description that identifies 6 stages.  There can be many others.  When a tholon “disperses”, whether due to loss of energy, destruction, absorption, or any number of ways, its stable pattern of energy can come to an end.  What then survives and where does the energy go?  The energy goes to wherever it can go with the least resistance.  This might be the parent tholon but perhaps it could be a peer as well.  It could also stay right where it is if there are no immediately available paths of lesser resistance, not unlike a static charge that is held until it can be released.  The various possibilities could easily describe what we commonly called the *oversoul*, ghosts, spirits of the dead, poltergeists, and various other types of disincarnates that are something like an *implicit instance*, or an instance that does not have the structure, energy, or opportunity necessary to take form, like the ink dots in the glycerin example.

## Aliens and UFOs

As long as we’re talking about the afterlife we might as well address the subject of aliens and UFOs.  This will be very short, because if the tholonic understanding that the universe itself, and everything in it, are different expressions of intelligence, than asking "is there intelligent life in the universe?" would be like wondering if there is such a thing as water while swimming in the ocean. Aliens, UFOs, etc., are instances of archetypes, and their instantiations will wholly depend on the context and scope they are perceived in.  Here, context includes cultural beliefs and the abilities of the perceiver.  Is/was Earth visited by aliens, and if so, what role have they played in our story?  From the tholonic perspective, asking such a question is valid if the answer brings us closer to a verifiably better understanding of reality.  The tholonic question is, what are the tholons that exist beyond our perception of reality? How can/will they be perceived and  how will/do they affect our reality? Are there other forms of SAI that have evolved on any of the 40 billion exoplanets that can support life in our galaxy, or elsewhere for that matter, evolved to the point where they have a cosmic influence? The most reasonable answer is probably "probably".

The tholonic view is (to rephrase Richard Feynman): 

> It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.

### Sadhguru explains

Some months after writing the above text, I “coincidentally” came across a short excerpt from a lecture by Jaggi Vasudev, a 62 year-old English Major turned yoga teacher in India.  He goes by the name *Sadhguru*, and currently runs an ashram. He has given speeches at the United Nations, and has founded the Isha Foundation which teaches yoga and appears to be heavily involved in environmental and spiritual issues.  He was addressing the question “Is there rebirth?” and his answer was especially tholonic in nature.  Below is a transcript of his answer, which was slightly modified for grammatical reasons alone, along with commentary.

> The question is, is there re-birth? If it’s there, what is the basis for one being to go from one birth to another? What is it that carries a person from one to another?  Now, if you need to understand this, you must have some understanding of the mechanics of who you are.  I am talking about the mechanics of how a human being is built.  When you say “I am a human being”, you are speaking of the outermost periphery, the physical body.  In yoga, we look at everything as “body” because it is easier for you to understand it that way.  So we see the body as five dimensions or five sheaths.

> Physical body is known as *Annamaya Kosha*.  *Anna* means “the food.” This is the food body.  The next one is called *Manomaya Kosha*, which refers to the mental body.  The third one is called *Pranamaya Kosha*, which refers to the energy body.  Physical body, mental body, energy body, all these three dimensions are physical.  They are physical existence.  Physical body is very gross, mental body is subtler, energy body is even subtler but all these three are physical.  This is just like the light bulb is physical, you can see that.  The electricity behind [the light bulb] also is physical, isn’t it?  The wire that connects is also physical; the electrons that flow through the wire also are physical existence.  So similarly, physical body, mental body, *pranic* body all are physical dimensions of life.

Not surprisingly, we are seeing the tholonic trigram model.  In this case it is the energy of our being (prana), the matter of our being (physical), and the integration of our being (mental, as all of reality is an instance of intelligence).  These are contextual instances of *Negotiation*, *Definition*,  and *Contribution*.

>  This physical dimension of life in all these three dimensions carries the imprints of karma; On the body, it is imprinted, on the mind it’s imprinted and on the energy it’s imprinted.  This karmic imprint, or the karmic structure, is what holds it together.  Karma is the cement which holds you to the physical body.  Karma is the bondage at the same time.  It’s only because of karmic stuff you can hold on to the body and be here.

He points out that karma here is a synonym for structure, and it is this structure that accounts for the existence, or instantiation, of things.  The concept of karma tends to be associated with values and judgments, ideas such as good and bad, right and wrong, but outside of these subjective and culturally relative ideas, karma is structure, and that structure, from the tholonic perspective, is the thologram in its entirety.  The thologram is the structure of karma, and karma is the law of instantiation.

> This is where spirituality seems to be difficult because if you try to take it away it doesn’t work.  If you try to add, it doesn’t work.  You need to be just there.  If you’re just there, it’s a moment.  The next two dimensions are called *Vignanamaya Kosha* and *Anandamaya Kosha*.  *Vignanamaya Kosha* is non-physical but related to the physical.  It is like a transient state.  *Anandamaya Kosha* is completely non-physical.  So, *Vignanamaya Kosha* and *Anandamaya Kosha* means it’s the bliss body.

If we replace the concept of *spirituality* with the concept of a *tetrahedron*, we can also say “If you try to take any part (a bot) away, it doesn’t work.  If you try to add  any part, it doesn’t work. It can only be (a tetrahedron)".

In the tholonic model there is a similar concept of the *koshas*, for prior to the realm of instantiation, or the physical reality, there are two states.  These are the two points (that have dimension) that must exist before the 3<sup>rd</sup> dimensional point can be created.  The first point of dimension is the *green dot* of *Definition* (*Anandamaya Kosha*) which defines 1 dimension.  This point has no actual existence outside of uninstantiated awareness.  It is essentially the perfect awareness of awareness (the N-state is a state of pure awareness).   This is followed by the *red dot* (*Vignanamaya Kosha*), the point of *Contribution*, and the addition of another dimension.  This dot, which Sadhguru says is a transitional state, is what allows  the form to come into existence, and is the dot that returns the energy to the N-source .  

> There is a bliss body inside which is one-hundred percent non-physical.  It has no form of its own.  Only if the energy body, the mental body, and the physical body are in shape it can hold the bliss body in shape.  If these things are taken away the bliss body will just become a part of the cosmos.  So whatever you are referring to as *atman* or the soul is a fiction actually, in a sense, because people are describing a certain limitation of the non-physical as a soul, but the body for the soul is still your karma.  If the karmic structure is completely dismantled, there is no soul; everything merges into everything else.  What is referred to as *Mahasamadhi* or *Mahaparinirvana*, is just this; that you slowly understand where the keys are and dismantle the karmic structure so that you become truly no more.

This is profoundly similar to the tholonic model in that without any structure there are no instances, no archetypes.  The concept of a soul here is equivalent to that of a parent tholon, or the higher order of structure that have lead to a thing’s existence.  Tholonically, there is no difference between the “soul” of a human and the “soul” of a rock in that they are both instances of the primal awareness at different points within the thologram.  His claim that “If the karmic structure is completely dismantled, there is no soul” also applies in that “If the tholonic structure is completely dismantled, there is only a 0-dimensional concept of SAI”

>  When somebody dies, we say this person is no more, but that’s not true.  That person is no more the way you know them, but they still very much exist.  Now, if you dismantle the karmic structure one-hundred percent, now you merge with the existence.  This is what is referred to as *Mukti*.  In yogic tradition, it is referred to as *Mahasamadhi*.  In the Buddhist way it is called *Mahaparinirvana*.  Generally in English we say *liberation*.

Remove the structure, i.e. remove the green-dot and the red-dot, and you are left only with pure Awareness (and Intention).

> Liberation means becoming free from the very process of life and birth and death.  Liberation means becoming free from the basic structures of body and mind, and for all this, the karmic structure are the strings that hold these things together.  So, when a person dies, obviously, the physical body is something that you borrowed from the earth.  This body is just earth, isn’t it?  You understand?  This physical body is just a piece of earth, which is right now prancing around as your body.  But you have to pay it back, atom to atom.  No interest though, but you have to pay back every atom.  You won’t be allowed to carry a single atom from this planet, nobody has managed it.  (Laughs) 

Tholons are the creations of tholons, and those tholons that can instantiate have a life-span, whether it’s 26 nanoseconds or 6&times;10<sup>99</sup> years.  They exist due to laws and limits.  Using Sadhguru’s words, we can say it is the karma of a pion to exist for only 26 nanoseconds.  The underlying law of the tholon is that everything is seeking a balance, which is why everything must be ”paid back”, i.e., the final balance must be zero.  The body's return to the earth is the same idea as the energy of a tholon’s instance returning to the parent tholon, but within the context of the material world.

> The physical body will fall apart, but the mental body and the pranic body, depending upon the strength of your karma, goes on.  If the karmic structure is very intense, unfinished, then it has to finish it.  If the karma has become weak because it has run its course, then it very easily finds another body.  If it has to find another body, the intensity of this structure should come down, it should become passive.  If it is very intense, it cannot find a body, so it just hangs there.  This is what you are referring to as ghosts.  Somebody is dead; his karmic structure is still intense because it’s not over.  He still exists, but he needs much more time to find another body.  The more intense his karmic structure is, the more visible he becomes and the more experientially available to people.  There are innumerable such beings all around you, whether you know it or not, but most of them you won’t feel because their karma is dissipated.  They are just waiting for more dissipation before they find another body.

What is here referred to as the *karmic structure* is equivalent to the stability of a tholon.  A super-stable tholon, such as the structure of hydrogen or whatever forces in existence account for Plank’s Constant, are not about to fall apart any time soon.  One of the reasons for this (and maybe the sole reason) is because there are too many other tholons in existence that depend on it, and therefore support and reinforce the existence of hydrogen or Plank’s Constant.  Weak karma is equivalent to the disintegration of a tholon‘s structure, whose energy will quickly find another path, or if not, hang around waiting to discharge.

> This is why [we believe] that if somebody dies unnaturally, either by accident or suicide or some other way, they will become ghosts.  This is not correct as everybody becomes a ghost.  It is just that those with intense karma are more available to your experience because they have more intense karmic structures, so people may experience them a little more than other beings who die of old age.  If one completes his allotted karma for that life, he will simply die, just like that.  Without disease, without accident, without any injury.  When one dies simply like that, that person may find another body within hours.  This is why [it is said that] if one completes his life and dies peacefully it’s the best way to die because he need not hang around and can immediately move on.

Sadhguru says that intense karmic structures prevents someone from reincarnating immediately and that this intense, or highly energized and imbalanced structure can be perceived as various types of disincarnates, or *implicit instances*.  In one way, each tholon and its instance is like a battery, functioning until it has balanced out its energy.  This undissipated or imbalanced energy can only exist in the same energy patterns that allowed for its existence in the first place, hence, a new instance, with new energy patterns, will not be possible until the old energy patterns have balanced.

This sounds similar to how a particular electron that is part of the energy in the clouds before a lightning storm can not be used in a light bulb until the lightning has discharged and the electrons are returned to the ground, balancing the charge and making those electrons available to the light bulb circuit.

> For those who walk the spiritual path, the ultimate goal for every spiritual seeker is he wants to break this whole process.  What you call your soul is like a bubble.  The outer periphery of the bubble is your karmic structure.  Inside there is air.  Suppose you burst the bubble.  Where is the air?  Where is *your* air?  There is no such thing as *your* air; it’s become part of everything.  So what you refer to as soul is fictitious because there is no such thing as *your* soul and *my* soul and somebody else’s soul.  Right now, this unboundedness is contained in a limited karmic structure, so it makes you believe as if this is a separate entity.  If you take away the keys which hold the karmic structure, then it just collapses.

What you call anything, be it yourself, a plant, a river, a bug, is a tholon, and a tholon is simply a structure that emerged from energy moving through whatever resources are available and interacting with itself according to the limits and laws of those resources and its context and scope.  This is a verbose description of a bubble.  Within that structure is the “thing”&hellip; no structure equals no thing.

In both Sadhguru’s model of reality and the tholonic model, transcending the cycle of creation and destruction and life and death can be achieved by realizing one is “nothing more” than a state of SAI.  But there is another very important concept that can also be applied, and that is, while every tholon is a product of creation, not every tholon is itself a creator.  It is up to the reader to apply this concept to their own existence, but to this point, Sadhguru also expresses this very tholonic concept (The word “organized” has been replaced with “structured”):

> The structured mind produces structured emotions, and this increases the energy that moves through and structures the body.  When one’s complete being, mind, emotion, body and the energy that moves through them, is then structured, they are not simply a piece of creation but a creator with ability to manifest their vision.

### Direction of Intention

Here we return to the concept of *intention* which was skipped over previously.  Looking at the tholonic model, it would be easy to imagine how it could evolve towards some very dark sides of existence just as easily as it could towards bright sides because there is no implicit morality or definition of right or wrong.  The tholon is a structure, a machine, so to speak.  While there are plenty of examples of dark instances throughout the history of existence, on the whole, existence has tended towards being a contributing factor to life.  We can say that this is because no matter what the direction of intention, it will always tend toward being balanced, so it has a built in protection against going too far to one side or another, as the laws of physics shows us.  

There is another understanding as well which can be understood using the same powers of observation and reason that fuels scientific thinking.  In its simplest form, we can say that it has been observed that, for the most part in life, the body prefers health and pleasure over sickness and suffering, the mind prefers peace and joy over violence and misery, and emotions of love and compassion are preferred over hate.  This would suggest that the original intention of creation was more in the direction of health, peace, and love than sickness, violence and hate.  

One could argue that these preferences are only a result of evolution as they contributed to survival, but that would only support the argument that this was the original intention.  In reality, we tend to see both sides working together, as in the very parasitic relationship between the predatory wasp and the slower cockroaches, but as we also see in that example, that it is ultimately a benefit to the cockroach gene pool and tholonic intelligence.  Think of it as Nature's *tough love*.  The same goes for any synergetic system, from rabbits and coyotes to political systems.  

*Constructive collaboration* only needs a slight edge over *destructive resistance* to ensure that reality will be more constructive than destructive, even if it at times destruction is winning.  This is similar to how the casino’s “house” only needs a 0.5% edge at the Black Jack table to transfer the players money into their coffers.  The house does not care about the individual winners or losers because they know that they have that 0.5% advantage, which is all they need to survive, and even thrive.  Our highly unscientific, unprovable, irrelevantly small sampling in the “Bless or Curse” experiment suggests that *constructive collaboration* has a house edge of about 2.5%, at least among the sample group for that moment in time.

The human brain, cellular mechanics, and all life in general, is wired to be both competitive[^182] and cooperative[^183] at the same time, which implies that this is (so far) the most effective manner for an instance to express the intention of its tholonic archetype that has its source in the *primal intention*.
