This touches on the related concept of weather man-made items are as much a product of nature as anything else, given that mankind is a product of nature.   It is the tholonic position that anything that exists can only be a product of the forces and laws of existence, and therefore is “natural”.  Tupperware, insecticides, genetically modified or invented life forms, computers, AI, cars, nuclear bombs, baseball, mirrors; all these things are as natural as beehives, ant colonies, beaver dams, poisonous volcanic fumes, asteroid collisions, and viruses.  Some creations are simply more sustainable than others.  If we consider that nothing is forever (except energy and maybe black holes), than nothing is ultimately sustainable (except high-entropy chaos).  Just look at our own tiny sliver of reality here on Earth.  In just the short time there has been life on Earth, 99.9% of all species have disappeared.  What percent of everything that ever existed in the Universe turned out to be sustainable? There is no way of knowing, but it’s probably safe to say that what exists now is a very, very small fraction of what has ever existed.  The Universe does not care if we go extinct or even if we destroy the planet, but many of its inhabitants do, as does the planet itself, and by extension our solar system.  There are many forces that have the power to make re-balancing adjustments when, and if, necessary.~~

# MATH appendix

If we convert these 2D tholon maps that make up the 3 sides of a 3D tholon into child tholons, we get the following three 3D tholons when viewing the from the “top” (so we are not seeing the base).  In this case, rather than show the 3 trigrams separately, they have been joined together and the overlapping colors only show the color they both have in common, so instead of seeing 2 sides of magenta and cyan, there is only 1 side of blue because magenta is blue and red, and yellow is blue and green.JWFIX[confusing]

Because we have overlapped the lines (and dropped the base), we can't apply the actual formulas.  They are shown simply to highlight a pattern of functionality.  The reader can come to their own conclusions.  

As a comparison, here are two versions of a square model of the same 12 formulas, but even here you can see tholonic patterns in both images (but maybe more so on the right image).

# PREDETRMINISM

### Sadhguru explains JWFIX[reqrite entire section]

Some months after writing the above text, I “coincidentally” came across a short excerpt from a lecture by Jaggi Vasudev, a 62 year-old English Major turned yoga teacher in India.  He goes by the name *Sadhguru*, and currently runs an ashram.  He has given speeches at the United Nations, and has founded the Isha Foundation which teaches yoga and appears to be heavily involved in environmental and spiritual issues.  He was addressing the question “Is there rebirth?” and his answer was especially tholonic in nature.  Below is a transcript of his answer, which was slightly modified for grammatical reasons alone, along with commentary.

> The question is, is there re-birth?  If it’s there, what is the basis for one being to go from one birth to another?  What is it that carries a person from one to another?  Now, if you need to understand this, you must have some understanding of the mechanics of who you are.  I am talking about the mechanics of how a human being is built.  When you say “I am a human being”, you are speaking of the outermost periphery, the physical body.  In yoga, we look at everything as “body” because it is easier for you to understand it that way.  So we see the body as five dimensions or five sheaths.

> Physical body is known as *Annamaya Kosha*.  *Anna* means “the food.” This is the food body.  The next one is called *Manomaya Kosha*, which refers to the mental body.  The third one is called *Pranamaya Kosha*, which refers to the energy body.  Physical body, mental body, energy body, all these three dimensions are physical.  They are physical existence.  Physical body is very gross, mental body is subtler, energy body is even subtler but all these three are physical.  This is just like the light bulb is physical, you can see that.  The electricity behind [the light bulb] also is physical, isn’t it?  The wire that connects is also physical; the electrons that flow through the wire also are physical existence.  So similarly, physical body, mental body, *pranic* body all are physical dimensions of life.

Not surprisingly, we are seeing the tholonic trigram model.  In this case it is the energy of our being (prana), the matter of our being (physical), and the integration of our being (mental, as all of reality is an instance of intelligence).  These are contextual instances of *Negotiation*, *Definition*,  and *Contribution*.

>  This physical dimension of life in all these three dimensions carries the imprints of karma; On the body, it is imprinted, on the mind it’s imprinted and on the energy it’s imprinted.  This karmic imprint, or the karmic structure, is what holds it together.  Karma is the cement which holds you to the physical body.  Karma is the bondage at the same time.  It’s only because of karmic stuff you can hold on to the body and be here.

He points out that karma here is a synonym for structure, and it is this structure that accounts for the existence, or instantiation, of things.  The concept of karma tends to be associated with values and judgments, ideas such as good and bad, right and wrong, but outside of these subjective and culturally relative ideas, karma is structure, and that structure, from the tholonic perspective, is the thologram in its entirety.  The thologram is the structure of karma, and karma is the law of instantiation.

> This is where spirituality seems to be difficult because if you try to take it away it doesn’t work.  If you try to add, it doesn’t work.  You need to be just there.  If you’re just there, it’s a moment.  The next two dimensions are called *Vignanamaya Kosha* and *Anandamaya Kosha*.  *Vignanamaya Kosha* is non-physical but related to the physical.  It is like a transient state.  *Anandamaya Kosha* is completely non-physical.  So, *Vignanamaya Kosha* and *Anandamaya Kosha* means it’s the bliss body.

If we replace the concept of *spirituality* with the concept of a *tetrahedron*, we can also say “If you try to take any part (a bot) away, it doesn’t work.  If you try to add  any part, it doesn’t work.  It can only be (a tetrahedron)”.

In the tholonic model there is a similar concept of the *koshas*, for prior to the realm of instantiation, or the physical reality, there are two states.  These are the two points (that have dimension) that must exist before the 3<sup>rd</sup> dimensional point can be created.  The first point of dimension is the *green dot* of *Definition* (*Anandamaya Kosha*) which defines 1 dimension.  This point has no actual existence outside of uninstantiated awareness.  It is essentially the perfect awareness of awareness (the N-state is a state of pure awareness).   This is followed by the *red dot* (*Vignanamaya Kosha*), the point of *Contribution*, and the addition of another dimension.  This dot, which Sadhguru says is a transitional state, is what allows  the form to come into existence, and is the dot that returns the energy to the N-source .  

> There is a bliss body inside which is one-hundred percent non-physical.  It has no form of its own.  Only if the energy body, the mental body, and the physical body are in shape it can hold the bliss body in shape.  If these things are taken away the bliss body will just become a part of the cosmos.  So whatever you are referring to as *atman* or the soul is a fiction actually, in a sense, because people are describing a certain limitation of the non-physical as a soul, but the body for the soul is still your karma.  If the karmic structure is completely dismantled, there is no soul; everything merges into everything else.  What is referred to as *Mahasamadhi* or *Mahaparinirvana*, is just this; that you slowly understand where the keys are and dismantle the karmic structure so that you become truly no more.

This is profoundly similar to the tholonic model in that without any structure there are no instances, no archetypes.  The concept of a soul here is equivalent to that of a parent tholon, or the higher order of structure that have xlead to a thing’s existence.  Tholonically, there is no difference between the “soul” of a human and the “soul” of a rock in that they are both instances of the primal awareness at different points within the thologram.  His claim that “If the karmic structure is completely dismantled, there is no soul” also applies in that “If the tholonic structure is completely dismantled, there is only a 0-dimensional concept of SAI”

>  When somebody dies, we say this person is no more, but that’s not true.  That person is no more the way you know them, but they still very much exist.  Now, if you dismantle the karmic structure one-hundred percent, now you merge with the existence.  This is what is referred to as *Mukti*.  In yogic tradition, it is referred to as *Mahasamadhi*.  In the Buddhist way it is called *Mahaparinirvana*.  Generally in English we say *liberation*.

Remove the structure, i.e. remove the green-dot and the red-dot, and you are left only with pure Awareness (and Intention).

> Liberation means becoming free from the very process of life and birth and death.  Liberation means becoming free from the basic structures of body and mind, and for all this, the karmic structure are the strings that hold these things together.  So, when a person dies, obviously, the physical body is something that you borrowed from the Earth.  This body is just Earth, isn’t it?  You understand?  This physical body is just a piece of Earth, which is right now prancing around as your body.  But you have to pay it back, atom to atom.  No interest though, but you have to pay back every atom.  You won’t be allowed to carry a single atom from this planet, nobody has managed it.  (Laughs) 

Tholons are the creations of tholons, and those tholons that can instantiate have a life-span, whether it’s 26 nanoseconds or 6&times;10<sup>99</sup> years.  They exist due to laws and limits.  Using Sadhguru’s words, we can say it is the karma of a pion to exist for only 26 nanoseconds.  The underlying law of the tholon is that everything is seeking a balance, which is why everything must be ”paid back”, i.e., the final balance must be zero.  The body’s return to the Earth is the same idea as the energy of a tholon’s instance returning to the parent tholon, but within the context of the material world.

> The physical body will fall apart, but the mental body and the pranic body, depending upon the strength of your karma, goes on.  If the karmic structure is very intense, unfinished, then it has to finish it.  If the karma has become weak because it has run its course, then it very easily finds another body.  If it has to find another body, the intensity of this structure should come down, it should become passive.  If it is very intense, it cannot find a body, so it just hangs there.  This is what you are referring to as ghosts.  Somebody is dead; his karmic structure is still intense because it’s not over.  He still exists, but he needs much more time to find another body.  The more intense his karmic structure is, the more visible he becomes and the more experientially available to people.  There are innumerable such beings all around you, whether you know it or not, but most of them you won’t feel because their karma is dissipated.  They are just waiting for more dissipation before they find another body.

What is here referred to as the *karmic structure* is equivalent to the stability of a tholon.  A super-stable tholon, such as the structure of hydrogen or whatever forces in existence account for Plank’s Constant, are not about to fall apart any time soon.  One of the reasons for this (and maybe the sole reason) is because there are too many other tholons in existence that depend on it, and therefore support and reinforce the existence of hydrogen or Plank’s Constant.  Weak karma is equivalent to the disintegration of a tholon‘s structure, whose energy will quickly find another path, or if not, hang around waiting to discharge.

> This is why [we believe] that if somebody dies unnaturally, either by accident or suicide or some other way, they will become ghosts.  This is not correct as everybody becomes a ghost.  It is just that those with intense karma are more available to your experience because they have more intense karmic structures, so people may experience them a little more than other beings who die of old age.  If one completes his allotted karma for that life, he will simply die, just like that.  Without disease, without accident, without any injury.  When one dies simply like that, that person may find another body within hours.  This is why [it is said that] if one completes his life and dies peacefully it’s the best way to die because he need not hang around and can immediately move on.

Sadhguru says that intense karmic structures prevents someone from reincarnating immediately and that this intense, or highly energized and imbalanced structure can be perceived as various types of disincarnates, or *implicit instances*.  In one way, each tholon and its instance is like a battery, functioning until it has balanced out its energy.  This undissipated or imbalanced energy can only exist in the same energy patterns that allowed for its existence in the first place, hence, a new instance, with new energy patterns, will not be possible until the old energy patterns have balanced.

This sounds similar to how a particular electron that is part of the energy in the clouds before a lightning storm can not be used in a light bulb until the lightning has discharged and the electrons are returned to the ground, balancing the charge and making those electrons available to the light bulb circuit.

> For those who walk the spiritual path, the ultimate goal for every spiritual seeker is he wants to break this whole process.  What you call your soul is like a bubble.  The outer periphery of the bubble is your karmic structure.  Inside there is air.  Suppose you burst the bubble.  Where is the air?  Where is *your* air?  There is no such thing as *your* air; it’s become part of everything.  So what you refer to as soul is fictitious because there is no such thing as *your* soul and *my* soul and somebody else’s soul.  Right now, this unboundedness is contained in a limited karmic structure, so it makes you believe as if this is a separate entity.  If you take away the keys which hold the karmic structure, then it just collapses.

What you call anything, be it yourself, a plant, a river, a bug, is a tholon, and a tholon is simply a structure that emerged from energy moving through whatever resources are available and interacting with itself according to the limits and laws of those resources and its context and scope.  This is a verbose description of a bubble.  Within that structure is the “thing”&hellip; no structure equals no thing.

In both Sadhguru’s model of reality and the tholonic model, transcending the cycle of creation and destruction and life and death can be achieved by realizing one is “nothing more” than a state of SAI.  But there is another very important concept that can also be applied, and that is, while every tholon is a product of creation, not every tholon is itself a creator.  It is up to the reader to apply this concept to their own existence, but to this point, Sadhguru also expresses this very tholonic concept (The word “organized” has been replaced with “structured”):

> The structured mind produces structured emotions, and this increases the energy that moves through and structures the body.  When one’s complete being, mind, emotion, body and the energy that moves through them, is then structured, they are not simply a piece of creation but a creator with ability to manifest their vision.




# AWARENESS

formalized For example, a simple test could be performed with two vases of identical water.  One vase can be subjected to constructive emotions, sounds, etc., while the others are subjected to destructive emotions, sounds, etc.  This water is then used to water two identical plants.  Any difference in the plant’s growth might be attributable to the “quality” of the water.  
JWFIX[again, do I need this?]
Why not simply expose the plants to such emotions?  Because the use of the tholonically compatible substance of water as a storage medium is the actual test.  How or if energetically-qualitative water affects plants is really the testing of the idea.  The question of whether plants are sensitive to any non-physical or non-electromagnetic stimulus remains, but we can look to the existing theories and tests to find that answer.  One such experiment is “The Florence Experiment”, where bean plants accompanied a human as they slid down a 20-meter slide installed in the *Palazzo Strozzi* Renaissance palace of art in Florence, Italy.   This exhibit was put together by plant neurobiologist Professor Stefano Mancuso, founder of plant neurobiology study JWFIX[mess!]that examined plant intelligence, and German artist and former entomology researcher and  Ph.D.  in Phytopathology Dr.  Carsten Höllerm.  

The idea was to see how plants responded to “fun” and “exciting” emotions.  This experiment was followed by another experiment where plants were exposed to people watching horror films.  Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I have yet to hear back from the producers of this experiment, who I reached out to in June of 2022.fmancuso

It would not be surprising if the results confirmed that plants respond to emotions.  In fact, it would be surprising if they did not, as plants, being the very bridge between the energy of the Sun and life on this planet, must be of a very high order of intelligence, at least according to the tholonic definition of intelligence of “The ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of energy within the scope of its existence.” and the tholonic claim that “Intelligence exists in anything that has a sustainable pattern of energy.” because plants are not only far more sustainable than all other forms of life, no other form of life is sustainable without them. 

# FIELDS

Remember that *m=E/c<sup>2</sup>*? This means mass is energy divided by *c*<sup>2</sup>, or 8.98755179 × 10<sup>16</sup> meters<sup>2</sup> / secs<sup>2</sup>.  That is a pretty, pretty big reduction of energy.  Mass is really, really slow energy, and by “slow” we mean a reduction in the speed of causality, and by that we mean, mass moves slower than energy.  Before you think to yourself, “Duh!”, imagine what that means locally and on a cosmic scale.  

c in the Univerlal contstant of cause and effect.  This is also teh speed at which energy can move.  Noteice, this sayine nothign about what energy is, just how it can move.  If we reduce cause and effect by c2, what do we get?  The smallest unit of time 

the vaklue is 0.00000000333564095, but what is that?  is it teh smallest unit 

Only mass has gravity, and mass is slow energy, and slow energy is the result of time, and time is the speed of causality; ergo, the more mass, the slower the time.  And that is exactly what we see; the more gravity, the slower the time.  Clocks on earth tick slower than clocks in space.  The current thinking that it is time that creates gravity can also be thought of as the slower speed of causality causing gravity, and the more the mass, the slower that causality, all the way up to a black hole where time stops at the event horizon.  **Yes, there is no time inside a black hole, and having no time, it can not have space-time but does have infinite gravity.  This is why a black hole is said to have 0 volume.  It is, in fact, a 0-dimensional point, a singularity, making black holes no more than a concept but a concept that shapes our universe.**  







In the tholonic model, if *E* (energy) is A&I, the originating *N-source*, then *Definition/limitation* (via *c*) creates *time*, resulting in the *Contribution/form/integration* quality of the space-time we exist in.  Yes, from a relativistic view, space and time are 2 sides to the space-time coin, and both came into existence together.  From the tholonic perspective, while they did come into existence together, there is still a path of their creation.  All numbers came into existence simultaneously, but we still have to go through 2 to get to 3.  We now have a spectrum of space-time across which many patterns will form.  Presumably, the first patterns formed on this spectrum were things like the EM radiation followed by matter and the gravitational fields, or, if you prefer the alternative theory of the Big Bang, the gravitational fields came before matter and were so strong they created matter. Either way, EM radiation, gravity, and possibly matter are the first instantiations of A&I.  Perhaps EM radiation is an instance of Awareness, and gravity is an instance of Intention, as these pairings are conceptually equivalent in many ways.  Culturally, we have equated light (EM radiation) with awareness, as in the *enlightened* who have heightened awareness, and the concept of *gravity* with the weight of serious goals, aims, purpose, responsibility, stability, etc., as in the *gravitas* of a deep thinker.

The concepts of Relativity map nicely onto the tholonic model and can tell us much about how tholons function.  The Brownian concepts tell us more about the tholon as a whole, suggesting that the smaller tholons are more controlled by external forces or circumstances than awareness but always have *some* element of awareness.  This idea also fits nicely with the tholonic view of the reality that rocks, chairs, and toasters do not have any observable form of awareness but tholonically have *some* element of awareness. 

From the tholonic view, all of existence, in one form or another, is an instance of A&I, but that which is alive, which grows and reproduces, are the first *observable* instances of consciousness if we don’t consider the far broader tholonic definition of “living organism”, which would include planets, galaxies, and the Universe.  Some of these living organisms appear to have the ability to consciously direct their intentions, independent of any biological needs or instincts. One might call that *free will*, but we’ll avoid that prickly concept for now (as we address it later). What can be said is the more A&I is instantiated, the more energy that is in motion, the more microstates of expansion available, the higher the entropy, and the greater the balancing potential.

### The Return to Nothingness

<img src='../Images/EGM.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>If you drop a rock in a still pond, there is a big splash, then a bunch of waves that spreads out as the energy of the impact disturbs the still water.  Eventually, everything calms down, and the water is still again.  The inevitable return to calm is due to entropy, but entropy cannot exist without gravity.  Entropy, gravity, and mass are one of the *uber*-trinities upon which this 3-dimensional space-time reality is built.  Remove any of these elements, and reality ceases to exist as we know it. If we can say the water returns to calm due to entropy, we can also say it is due to mass and/or gravity.  That’s why the concept of entropy was invented, as it’s easier to deal with than having to continually calculate the loss of heat or JWFIX  energy over time, the amount of heat due to friction, the force of that friction based on the masses involved (with their own gravitational fields), etc., etc.

The Big Bang was that rock that got dropped into the still waters of the void.  There was a splash, and we are currently riding the waves of that disturbance, but eventually, the Universe will return to a state of calm, perhaps even the nothingness it once was.  More to the point, if everything that exists is preceded by its archetypes, and stable patterns form archetypes as a result of the movement of energy, then all movement is either diverging from one archetype or converging towards another (or others).

In the case of the pond, the archetype it diverged from when it was disturbed was that of a *Still Pond*, and after the disturbance, the archetype it returns to is also that of a *Still Pond*, but the instance of the *Still Pond* has been changed slightly by the disturbance.  JWFIX  Technically, the same could be said about the rock, but as the rock was essentially unchanged by dropping into the water, the movement of energy was inconsequential, at least for this example.  If a ton of water were dropped into the pond, things would be a lot more complicated, but the fundamentals would be the same&hellip; the movement of energy that diverges from its most stable archetype(s) goes through many changes and forms many patterns and archetypes in the process of returning to the most stable pattern possible.  If the context is changed due to the disturbance, for example, rather than a rock or a meteor, then the resulting archetypes will not be the same as the initial archetypes.  As only one archetype has an absolute context, then it is that archetype that all other archetypes and all energy ultimately tend towards, and that is the first archetype, which is created by the 0D dot of A&I.

<img src='../Images/4forces.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>The tholonic model requires that every sustainable archetype instantiates in some form in the physical world, as that is an inevitable consequence of, and prerequisite for, its sustainability. Where can we find an instance of this primal archetype that all energy tends towards and will eventually arrive at?  Not surprisingly, the obvious candidate is the *Standard Model*, or the 4 fundamental forces of nature, which are: the strong force, electromagnetic force, the weak force, and gravity.  This is an example of 2 forces, *attraction* and *charge*,  in the 2 contexts of parent and child.  The stronger force of attraction holds matter (gravity) and nuclei (strong force) together.  The weaker force transfers energy waves (electromagnetic force) and energy particles (weak force of the W and Z *boson* particles that can transform neutrons into protons and neutrinos into electrons). JWFIX[what about neutrons otn electrns?]

The universal forces apply in the context of the Universe and extend to the edge of the universe. The atomic forces apply in the contextual range of the size of the nucleus, or about 10<sup>-13</sup> meters. *(Note: Technically, the EM force is greater than gravity, but as there can be negative EM forces, and there can’t be negative mass, the EM force can be neutralized or less than 0, while gravity can only be lessened, and can never be 0 or less.)* While the EM force can affect all mass, only the force of gravity exerts a constant pull.  Gravity is the force that all matter tends towards, making gravity the archetype that all energy tends towards.   
JWFIX[above abndnd below]

Science has theorized that at the end of time, there will be nothing left in the Universe except the black holes that all matter has fallen into due to their immense gravitational pull.  This gravitational field at a point of a black hole singularity can (we think) infinitely warp space-time.  Science can only guess how that will affect the *Strong Nuclear Force*, but it’s probably safe to say that if time and space go bye-bye, the SNF won’t function the same way.  It is most likely that the black hole destroys all structure down to the quantum level, creating a ball of pure, dense, concentrated&hellip;“stuff”.  These black holes then slowly radiate their “stuff” away over the next 3&times;10<sup>107</sup> years, leaving a perfect void of nothingness.  Science has a problem with this, and they call it the “Information paradox” because, according to science, everything can’t just disappear into a void of nothingness, but according to this theory, it does, so they are diligently working to come up with various solutions to this paradox that use wormholes, quantum effects, “Fuzzballs”, and “Soft-Hair” (actual names) theories.  A few existential scientists think that, yes, in the end, everything returns to nothingness.

However, suppose we can accept the idea that the fundamental archetype for matter (gravity) is an instance of the fundamental archetype for consciousness (A&I), as some scientists have already suggested. In that case, while the material world may return to nothingness, the A&I that started it all has not because, being a 0-dimensional concept, it can’t be destroyed because it doesn’t actually exist.  Perhaps that is why new Big Bangs, new instances of the first movement of Awareness and Intention, and the new universes they create can, according to at least one theory, occur *within* the Black Holes, just as this Universe is inside some Black Hole “somewhere else” in “reality”.

These highly speculative ideas are primarily meant to explore how existing concepts can be applied to new contexts.  Perhaps they are useless, but they are now part of the collective intelligence and perhaps they will contribute to moment *spontaneous deduction* and  or *mutual knowledge*.[^351]

# MIND

we are off to a dreadful start. This area of research of much more complicated than, say, nuclear physics, and we need only to look at the Castle Bravo atomic detonation in 1954, which turned out to be 2.5 times bigger than expected, contaminating the surrounding 15 islands of the Bikini Atoll, sickening and killing many residents.



# INSTANCES

While there is no such particle made of UUU or DDD quarks (as far as I know, and if one did exist, it would be so imbalanced and unstable it would only exist for an instant), they do exist in an uninstantiated state in the parent, the blue dot, the N-state, which, again, is a state that exists only as a concept, not in material reality.  

The parent holds within it the limits of its context, which, in this case, are the values 0 and 7.  Alternatively, we can think of the parent tholon as having 6 archetypes of a quark, but in order to instantiate, they need to find a stable pattern.  Not surprisingly, that stable pattern appears to be 2 sets of 3, or 2 *baryons* (any 3 quarks are called a *baryon*), of the 4 possible groupings of quarks, group 1, with its combinatons of [1,2,4] is the most stable.  Note: This is why we assigned UP as 0 and DOWN as 1 because [1,2,4] is a far more stable pattern than [3,5,6], and as UP and DOWN are arbitrary concepts, either value of 1 or 0 could apply. 

the potential of 2 baryons (any 3 quarks is called a *baryon*) made up of 3 quarks eachwith  3 UP and 3 DOWN, but in order to instantiate, they need to find a stable pattern, which happens to be a pair of balanced (or as balanced as possible) sets of 3 quarks, or *baryon*  that balance out.  In the world of physics, a quark with a value 1 will pair with a quark with a value 3, but tholonically, a quark of value 3 must pair with a quark of value 4, as the total (3+4) must equal the limits (7).  As far as quarks are concerned, it seems that 3, 5, and 6 all act like 3, and 1, 4, and 2 all act like 1.  We can see this example if we revisit the octahedron (image below).

<center><img src='../Images/2triocta.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Tholonically, the octahedral is composed of 6 protons and 6 neutrons, with 2 trigrams that define the limits.  3,5,6 is a single proton trigram out of 3, and 1,2,4 is a single neutron trigram out of 3.   Presumably, they all act the same; however, it might just be that there are 3 types of protons and 3 types of neutrons.


For this reason, we can assign any U as 14 and any D as 7.  Now, a proton, being any combination of UUD, is therefore 14+14+7, or 7&times;5, or 35,  and a neutron is any combination of UDD, or 7+7+14, or 7&times;4, or 28.  The ratio of difference (28/35) between these two values happens to be 0.8, or 4/5, or 1/5 short of 1, which is not only the measured value of the first generation of a tholon (using the method described in the last chapter), but also explains why 5 is so critical in exposing the pattern of binary growth and decimation (as in ‘reduced by 10’, not ‘complete destruction’, as the word is commonly used to describe) of the &pi;-based pattern we see in the thologram.

However, to the best of our current knowledge, entropy is only positive and ever growing in one direction only.  If we were to chart these two dimensions (middle image, below), there would be 

one axis for +chaos  that goes from 1 to 0, and 

one axis for -chaos that goes from 0 to 1.  

We also know that every system starts with lower entropy and ends with higher entropy, which means that every system must start with +chaos and end with -chaos.  This gives us 2 lines; the +chaos, which is the chaos wherein patterns emerge or move from implicit to explicit, and -chaos, wherein patterns disappear, or move from explicit to implicit.  The “zone of order” is the most likely place where order will emerge, with the 0-point in the middle as the point of least chaos, and therefore highest order. 

<IMG src="../Images/chaos-ent-chart3_SINGLE.png" style="float:right;width:20%"/>The image on the right is an attempt to show how chaos and entropy are related, although there are many, many ways this relationship can be shown.  This graph is not meant to be technically accurate, but only conceptually clear.  What it attempts to show is how entropy is 1 dimension of both types of chaos, +chaos and -chaos, between which order exists and which generally describes the life span of any system whether its the universe or a plant.  


As an example, if we consider a hyper-simplified concept of the Big Bang, it would begin at a point of 0 entropy and 1 chaos.  As entropy increases with time, and with the movement of energy in the system, patterns would begin to form, creating order.  This happens in the +chaos side of the curve.  The point of 0 chaos represents the highest level of order that can be achieved. From that point on, the order begins to deteriorate when the loss of energy, due to increasing entropy, is insufficient to maintain the order, and that disintegration or order ends in -1 chaos and 1 entropy.  The values of 1 and 0 are meant to represent the contextual minimums and maximums.

If we merged the 2 dimensions to be on the same plane, which is typically how these two dimensions are shown, we see an interesting pattern that suggests that in some reality connected to ours, time runs backwards, and indeed that is a legitimate hypothesis [^336] , but time is not running backwards in the way you migth think as it’s *anti-time* or *negative-time* existing in a universe of *anti-matter*, and we could exist in such a reality no differently from the one we exist in now as long as all matter, axis, and time were equally inverted.  This is called the *charge, parity, and time (CPT) reversal symmetry*, and it is well understood.  If we woke up tomorrow morning in the *anti-world* version of our current reality we live in now, we would not notice anything different, as long as the CPT was inverted.   This idea is also the basis to William James Sidis’s speculative hypothesis on the reversal of entropy [^370].  The important point being made here is how the same patterns naturally appear, and not which theory is correct, as all of the competing theories that currently exist will continue to change over time.

# CIA paper ref

This concept is neatly summarized in a very insightful analysis report from a very unlikely source, the CIA.  In 1983, the CIA commissioned the U.S Army Intelligence and Security Command (USAINSCOM) to analyze the findings and potential use of recent scientific, albeit bleeding edge, research that involved humans consciousness, out-of-body travel, super-intelligence, psychic and psychedelic perception, telepathy, and even time-travel along with a number of alternative paradigms of reality.  This report was classified for 20 years [^372], but was republished by McDonnall along with university of Pennsylvania researcher and Rowan university math professor and author, Sky Waterpeace

<IMG src="../Images/chaos-trigram-2.png" style="float:right;width:30%"/>As this process of emergence and decay of order applies to any system, then it also applies to not just the life of the universe, but the life of all the systems created in the universe, and the systems that those systems create, etc., etc., making reality a dynamic fractal of countless embedded systems of  *low entropy chaos &rarr; order&rarr; high entropy chaos*.  We can see this same pattern in a rotated version of the prior tetrahedral image that showed how chaos is fundamental to low and high entropy as well as the *cause* that creates child systems.  

The apple on the shelf follows the same rules as the universe, as did the tree, weather, planet, solar system, etc., that made the existence of that apple possible.

 Coincidentally, the middle of the natural log of *c<sup>2</sup>* is also *c*, i.e., $e^{\ln(c^2)/2}=c$, but this is the case with any squared value whose log is divided by 2 because $e^{\ln(n^2)/2}=n$).  This is more than just a mathematical coincidence.  If the natural neares of growth is logorithmic, then teh square of any measure represents the 2 identical axis that define that measure, the ‘space’ of that measure, so to speak.  Likewise, median of that logarithmic space will always equal the value fo the measure.  The same for cubes

### Elements of a Tholonic Experiment

What do we claim about tholons that we could use to create new tests?

- The tholonic concept of the source of energy is SAI.
- Tholons have consciousness, intention, and intelligence.
- Tholons, once created, will always tend towards self-preservation via a balanced state.
- Tholonic predicates, or dynamic attributes, act like a magnetic field, can transfer information, and can’t effect mass.
- Tholonic objects, or static attributes, act like an electric field, can’t transfer information, but can exert a force on mass.
- All instances below that of space-time will follow the arrow-of-time, e.g. “person eats apple” moves in only one direction because the predicate/dynamic “eats” is irreversible.  While and person can’t un-eat an apple, tholonically “apple eats person” is also valid archetype, albeit one whose instantiation is rare and/or not obvious (but this may be changing thanks to the *biodegradable burial-pod project*[^347]).
- Tholons “above” space-time are not limited by physical constants, such as speed-of-light, but their instances are.
- Tholons have a data store, but instances of that data is limited by whatever that store is (i.e. speed-of-light transmission, entropy), which can only exist within the space-time tholon.
- One tholon can have more than one instantiation.
- Tholonic instances are “entangled” within a tholon, meaning inter-instance communication is instantaneous, but only on the archetypal level, not among their material instances.  This means information between two physical instances is limited by space-time, but is instantaneous between their archetypes.
- Tholons are fractal and self-similar.
- Tholons contain a thesis, an antithesis, and can produce a synthesis.
- A stable tholon must have balanced energy, i.e, energy in equals energy out.  Unstable tholons do not need to be balanced within themselves, but the difference in energy must come form somewhere or go somewhere, and they are (probably) short-lived.
- A tholon has 4 attributes: 1) a source of energy, 2) contextual limits on expression (of energy),  3) output or transformation (of energy), 4) movement (of energy)
- The archetype of a tholon is a tetrahedron, whose archetypes is a trigram.  The trigram is a pattern formed by 3 properties 1) a stable pattern of energy, 2) definition/limitation, and 3) contribution/integration. 
- Tholons have fields made of two parts that are, in their most primal form, SAI, or the field of its existence and the field of the movement of energy through its existence.  This is similar to an electric field and a magnetic field.  The field of Intention (movement) can transfer energy.  The field of Awareness can transfer information.  Because it has fields, it also has induction and conduction, therefore,  tholonic objects can create predicates, and predicates can create objects, e.g. electric fields can create magnetic fields and vise versa.  The same is (or appears to be) true for cause/effect, energy/mass, space/time, etc., all of which are instances of Awareness/Intention.
- Tholons preserve their path from the first instance, the primal tholon, to its current instance.
- Each tholon has (at least) 5-dimensions; the 4 coordinates of a synergetic/quadray coordinate system, plus time.

- As the thologram instantiates as a tetrahedron/tetrahedral matrix, material that is also tetrahedral in nature (water, certain minerals and crystals) is probably the easiest to work with.

beginning with (I I ) “I Am That I Am” is also interpreted as “I Am What I Am” or “I Am Who I Am”.   Yes, it is also intpreted as ‘I Am Who I Am”, but that is both concpetually, linguistically, and raciually inaccurate, and has more to do with the human need to anthropomophize everything.  A great deal of the meaning in English or Greek translations of the original text comes from the decisions of the translators, and considering scholars have spent years analyzing the significance of the first letter of the Torah, and even more years on the first word, it’s safe to say that the true meaning of the original phrase is still being deciphered and a true translations would require volumes.  While this may be true, both statements stand on their own in English, regardless where it originated form, but rather than being synonymous, they are, tholonically, quite different, even opposite of each other on one sense.  



While “I Am That I Am” apples t the source of creations, “I Am What I Am” applies only to that which is, or has been, created, making *Popeye the Sailor Man* a far better icon than that of the Creator.  



Believe it or not, there is more commentary that one would imagine on the difference between these two phrases, mostly intent on making it clear that Jehovah and Popeye are quite different.  Having never met either, I have no opinion, but I am quiet clear on the difference between the word “what” and “that”.  Without getting into the etymology and various contextual meaning of those words, or the crippling limitations of English when interpreting ancient languages like Hebrew, Sanskrit, and other semantically complex languages (albeit syntactically less evolved), in our context the word “that” refers to a specific subset of the whole, whatever that happens to be, and the word “what” refers to the context of “that”.

For purpoese of testing, we’ll start with teh prusumtion that Awanress alone is pure energym but energy that has no movement, and Intentions is the movement of that.



A complete tholon is tetrahedral in nature, meaning it has 3 axis formed by 3 pairs that are perpendicular to each other.  These axis represent 3 perspectives of the tholon.  

In its most abstract form, these 3 axis represent 1 *instance*. These points represent a 0-dimensional concept and the 2 expressions of that concept that define its scope.  In this sense, these 2 expressions are conceptually “perpendicular” to each other.  It is within, or between, these 2 limits that the concept s must instantiate.  These opposite poles can be thesis/antithesis, positive/negative, high/low, hot/cold, or any pair that defines a scope of any type.

~~In the most metaphysical sense, the concept of the 0D point as existence is simply one of *being*, the awareness of “I Am”.  Intention is implied by the reasonable presumption that some movement must have been initiated for the 0D dot to exist in the first place, and that movement is always preceded by an intention.  This movement is therefore inherent in all descend from this 0D point, and which we understand as energy.~~  

~~As~~



~~If the reader will indulge me for a moment, I would like to take a slight detour to clear up seemingly insignificant grammatical misunderstanding which will also prove to be an effective linguistic description of the thologram.~~ 

As energy is Awareness and Intention, we would expect to see the 2 poles of Awareness and Intention that define the spectrum of creation in the expression of energy, and we do in the polarities that define each scope of existence, starting with *time* and *space*.  Which is an instance of which is debatable, or perhaps even pointless, although *Intention* does imply *time*, and though *Awareness* does not imply *space*, per se, it does imply a point, which implies space.  

One of the instances of energy is electricity, and it, too, as its own pair or instances; the electric field and magnetic field.  Both fields have their respective pairs of positive and negative forces, which is required for a field to exist.  One could argue that it is the positive/negative forces that create the fields, but the tholonic view is that is it the creation of a field that allows for the instances of +/- charges.

When are have only 2 axis, we typically consdier them as perpendicular (⊥) to each other yo understadbns how they interatci with each other tp create a 3rd context.  Awareness and Intions defined energy before is instantiates, like a energy archetypes.  , or when we can call when we can call existance, or being, property, such as how space and time define movement, magnetism and charge define electricity, negative and pisitive define fields, etc., all fo which come form Awareness and Intention that define being.

We csee this 

, such as how we plot x/y charts, and 

<img src="../Images/evolution3.png" style='float:right;width:15%'>**Awareness** ⬌ ** ⬌ **Intention⥤** “*that which is*”:  This describes existence itself as “that which is”.  If we used the more personal “I Am” concept rather than “is”, we could say :” I do, therefore I am”, or ”I am, therefore I do”.  

**Time** ⬌ *which is* ⬌ **space⥤** *energy*: Energy, as we define it, only exists in space-time as energy requires movement, and space-time is the fabric of this reality.

**Negative charge** ⬌ *polarized* ⬌ **positive charges** ⥤ *electricity*: The existence of polarity is what allows for the instance of positive and negative charges

We tend to think in a object-centric manner, so we think of “eats” or “fills” as something that one object does to another.  The tholonic predicate-centric view is that “eats” or “fills” are concepts that gets instantiated via relationships between objects.   It is time and space that allow for the instantiation of energy, just like it is “person” and “apple” that allow for the instantiation of the concept ”eat”.  Every relationship, or predicate, requires 2 objects to instantiate itself. 

As a tholon, the instantiation of the concept of energy would look something like the image below where there is a 1) cause and effect, 2) spectrum of time, and 3) spectrum of space.   Cause and effect are contextual, e.g. energy/mass, action/reaction, impulse/waves, etc.  The time/space axis allows for the expression of energy, or movement.  They are the “verbs”, or “predicates”, but the cause/effect axis are the “nouns” or “objects”.  The movement of energy is what causes a magnetic field, and that field is capable to transmitting information yet not capable of applying a force of mass.  Geometrically, it is these dynamic lines of space and time that form the connections between the object properties of cause and effect.  For this reason, we consider space and time to be information-carrying fields.  The object attributes of cause/effect fields can not carry information but can exert a force on matter/energy, and like the electric field and unlike the magnetic field, can exist even when there is no movement of energy.  This is because the source fo the energy exists before there is movement, that source being the forces of Awareness and Intentions, which, which combined, we have called “That which is”, the first instance of the primal impulse of “is”.

<img src="../Images/blender-tholon.png" style='float:right;width:25%'>The diagrams below also show an arrow-of-time, or direction of entropy, as *space* and *time* only move in one direction, away from *cause* and towards *effect*, and both *time* and *space* converge to space-time at the point of *effect*.  The only way *cause* can connect to *effect* is via *space* and *time*.  *Space* and *time* also have two states, shown as *SPACE* and *space*, and *TIME* and *time*.  These represent the beginning and ending state of each property; beginning, or lower entropy *TIME* and/or *SPACE*, and final, or higher entropy *time* and/or *space*.  The same applies to the predicate, in this case the lower entropy *CAUSE* and the higher entropy *effect*.  This pattern is consistent with physics as we know that entropy increases as time flows forward, as does any movement through space.  So space-time represents the change in entropy, and *CAUSE*/*effect* represents the beginning and ending states of entropy.  However, as no part of the tholon can exist independent of any other part, this model also suggests that the existence of an *effect* must instantiate a *CAUSE*.  There is nothing in the tholon that prevents an effect from being instantiated first, which suggest that a *CAUSE* could be the result of an *effect*, which also implies that the past can be changed depending on the present.  How one can create an effect without there first being a *CAUSE* is another question, but as there is one state that exists prior to the instantiation of space-time, that state being one of Awareness and Intention, perhaps there is a way, but that “way” would have to be transcendental to space-time, and therefore this entire physical reality as we know it.
