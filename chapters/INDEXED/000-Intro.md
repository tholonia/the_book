# INTRODUCTION

  <u>THIS_IS_START</u>  

The <u>concept</u> that this <u>reality</u> is an illusion, a matrix, a <u>simulation</u>, or a dream, is not a new one.  From the very earliest creation stories of “*<u>God</u> created the heavens and the <u>earth</u>*” to our modern version of the “*<u>Simulation</u> Hypothesis*”, the story of creation has been the same.  It goes something like this:  Once upon a time there was nothing and within that <u>nothingness</u>, something appeared.  The details are left to be filled in by the imagination of scientists, mystics, philosophers, and poets, all seeking insight into the meaning and purpose of <u>life</u>, or at least a clue letting us know if we exist to merely survive, or to find happiness, to <u>love</u>, to win, to suffer, or to discover that Zorba the Greek knew the <u>truth</u> all along when he said “<u>Life</u> is what you do while you’re waiting to die”.  After all, our <u>existence</u> and <u>reality</u> may the ultimate and only one there is, or may be  just be a dream within a dream.  This book does not attempt to answer any of these questions any more than a radio’s manual can tell you what’s being broadcast.  This does not mean that it *doesn’t* answer these questions, but the ‘answers’ can mean many things to many people.

“<u>Tholonia</u>” is meant to describe the blueprint of creation, similar to a blueprint to a house, which only speaks to how a house is built, not what happens inside the house, how it will be used, or who did the actual building.  For those who believe <u>life</u> is a journey towards enlightenment, this is the blueprint of that path.  For those who believe they are enslaved in a matrix, this is the blueprint of that prison.  For those who believe <u>life</u> is a dream, this is the blueprint of the mind of the dreamer.  The overarching <u>concept</u> being presented is the idea that the mechanics of <u>existence</u> and <u>reality</u>, from <u>atoms</u> to <u>cultures</u> to galaxies, all follow the same <u>laws</u> and have the same <u>structure</u> as it applies to their context.  While the <u>ideas</u> and conclusions put forth apply to <u>society</u> and <u>culture</u>, as well as <u>science</u>, <u>politics</u>, <u>economics</u>, self-realization, <u>consciousness</u>, and <u>life</u> itself, I attempted to avoid social and <u>cultural</u> biases as much as possible, and where they do exist, I keep them to a minimum.

While this book is the result of years of investigation, research, and testing, it is still, and will always be, a work-in-progress.  The book itself is part of that research, as it presents a hypothesis, along with proofs, speculations, assumptions, deductions, and questions, all of which could benefit from  corrections, improvements, tests, and general finessing from the community-at-large. 

The conclusions in this book are my own, drawn from connecting the dots laid out in the following pages.  It is not my <u>intention</u> to promote my own conclusions, but rather, use them as an example of how one person has connected these dots.  It is these *dots* that give clues to the <u>structure</u> of <u>reality</u> and <u>existence</u>, but as there are countless dots, there are countless perspectives and understandings.  How we connect them is a subjective experience so you may connect these dots differently, or, you may not see anything worth connecting at all;  just a bunch of <u>random</u> <u>concepts</u> that have no relationship to one another (although I doubt you’d be reading this if that was the case). 

This book is written in the style of an argumentative proposal. Despite its occasional meandering, the progression of <u>concepts</u> presented attempts to maintain continuity with (hopefully) clear points, references, and a (somewhat) logical <u>order</u> of subjects.  It is also an exploration into new territory that <u>I am</u> certainly not an expert in.  That is why this book is open-sourced;  to allow other’s insights and <u>knowledge</u> to be integrated in the hope that a clearer picture of the mechanics of existential <u>awareness</u> will continue to evolve and emerge, allowing for corrections and updates.

**On a more mundane note…**

Please read [Appendix A, “About This Book”](#Appendix-A:-About-This-Book),  to understand why this book is written using an unconventional style of punctuation, grammar and spacing. It also addresses some technical eBook issues that the reader may find distracting.
